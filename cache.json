At this point, we thought, “Damn, this looks great.” A moment later, the screen flashed into full widescreen, revealing the actual makeover, and informing us that we had been momentarily fooled by the original arcade graphics. The redrawn aesthetic, in contrast, is a giant leap down.\nThis anecdote tells you all you need to know about the biggest issue of this remake of Data East's beat 'em up: its visuals are astoundingly tasteless. And no, it’s not a nostalgia issue. The graphics of the far superior arcade original are replaced with an art style that looks reminiscent of stiff, early-'00s Flash games. The new, shadow-puppet-like sprites lack depth, and their overly smooth limbs seem to float about in rest animations and skate unusually across the floor.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker.

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably.

          "description": "Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.\nRead more",

Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.\nRead more",

They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. \nRead more",

I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers!

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Reported by Bloomberg as a disagreement over attempts to \"spin off the video-game division as an independent entity,\" the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.\nRead more",

          "description": "Fifteen months on from its PS5 release, Final Fantasy XVI – that actiony RPG of emo-fringed hack ‘n’ slashing and disquietingly sexy Ralph Ineson characters – is now on PC. Enough time, you’d think, to do a proper job of rejigging it with Windows spanners, especially after Final Fantasy XV’s port got so much stick for its lack of features and performance issues.\nFFVXI does make some improvements, adopting a full set of DLSS and FSR upscalers and frame generators, and its mouse and keyboard integration feels generally slicker than XV. Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last month, Helldivers 2 studio Arrowhead thrust a white flag out from their shelled position in an attempt to placate mutinous fans of the co-op shooter. In response to a community sentiment best summed up by a popular Reddit post titled “Let the super earth burn”, Arrowhead released a statement. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update…what matters most now is action. Not talk.” Said action (which, it must be pointed out, felt a bit troublingly reactive to the loudest and most histrionic voices in the roo..uh, subreddit) was foreshadowed in a list of issues to be tackled over the coming months.\nRead more",

The result is a complicated, laborious survival citybuilder that's two parts compelling, and one part frustrating for the wrong reasons.\nRead more",

Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.\nRead more",

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Project Mugetsu is a Roblox game inspired by the anime and manga series Bleach. If you’re a Bleach fan, you’ve probably heard the term “Bankai.” If not, it’s basically the ultimate attack of a Soul Reaper in the series. Since the game revolves around that concept, unlocking Bankai is key to maximizing your character's potential.\n\n\nTo help you out, we’ve put together a guide on how to unlock Bankai in Project Mugetsu.\n\n\nWhat is the Meditation Level in Project Mugetsu?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBefore we jump in, let’s chat about the Meditation Level. Each player has a specific Meditation Level that goes up when you enter Meditation Mode. You’ll get some key bindings to press, and every correct press earns you one Meditation EXP. But watch out—hit the wrong key, and you’ll lose ten Meditation EXP. If you want to speed things up, using the x2 Mastery can help you double your gains.\n\n\nHow to get Bankai in Project Mugetsu\n\n\nTo unlock Bankai, you’ll need to reach a meditation level of 75 if you’re not in the Urahara Clan. If you are in that clan, you can unlock Bankai at level 50. Just keep in mind that there’s one requirement for all clans: you need to be at player level 40. So, beginners won’t be able to unlock Bankai right off the bat.\n\n\nOnce you hit those levels, you’ll have to win a battle against your Zanpakuto to finally unlock your Bankai.\n\n\nAll the Bankai in Project Mugetsu\n\n\nThere are seven Bankais in this game. Here’s the list:\n\n\n\nTensa Zangetsu\n\n\nZanka No Tachi\n\n\nNozarashi\n\n\nMinazuki\n\n\nKamishini No Yari\n\n\nSenbonzakura Kageyoshi\n\n\nDaiguren Hyorinmaru\n\n\nThe post How to get Bankai in Project Mugetsu appeared first on Destructoid.",

Luckily, you can unlock a handy-dandy fast-travel system that will hasten your quest to seal the rifts to the Still World.\n\n\nEchoes of Wisdom's Fast Travel is easy to unlock and even easier to use\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nYou won't have to wait too long to uncover Echoes of Wisdom's fast-travel system. The game subtly points you down the path you need to go to unlock it, and it takes time to ensure you understand how useful it is. Of course, if you're rushing to get your first dungeon or scope out some fun side-quests, you might breeze by the fast-travel tutorial.\n\n\nTo unlock fast travel, head east along the base after you've escaped Hyrule Castle, spelunk your way through Beach Cave, and finally stop by Suthorn Town. Instead of heading north to the Suthorn Temple, keep going east until you find a green, glowing statue. This is the first of many Waypoints you'll find on your travels across Hyrule.\n\n\nOnce you're close enough to the statue, Tri will explain what it is and how to activate it. To activate the Waypoint, walk up to it and hit the \"RZ\" trigger, like when you learn a new Echo. Once you've lit the Waypoint, you can activate it anytime by opening the map with the \"-\" button.\n\n\nBefore you wander into the unknown, remember that the first waypoint you find is the only one the game highlights for you. From here on out, you’ll have to keep your eyes open and take the time to activate every Waypoint you stumble across. Trust me, you’ll need them once the side quests start piling up.\n\nThe post How to unlock fast travel in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, one resident of Hyrule Castle Town is eager to see some of the monsters you've collected. Here's how to complete the A Curious Child quest in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.\n\n\nA Curious Child quest location\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nLocated north of Suthorn Forest, Hyrule Castle Town sits at the center of your map. Upon entering the town, take a left to find a boy standing outside a house with an orange roof. Talking to him will initiate the A Curious Child quest.\n\n\nA Curious Child quest guide\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe boy wants to see a Zol, one of the first monster Echoes you can obtain. If you don't have one yet, you can find them all over Hyrule Field. Once you have a Zol, summon the monster in front of the boy to briefly satisfy his curiosity.\n\n\nNext, the boy will want to see an Ignizol. This is another monster Echo that you can obtain early from the first cave directly west of Suthorn Village. You can also find a pit full of Ignizols northeast of Hyrule Ranch. Summon an Ignizol near the boy to advance to the boy's final request.\n\n\nLastly, the boy wants to see a Hydrozol. This monster can be found in the northeast corner of Hyrule near Seesyde village. Southwest of the Seesyde docks, across the water, you can find a cave containing Hydrozols.\n\n\nIf you summon a regular Hydrozol in front of the boy, he'll be disappointed by the monster's size. To get a giant Hydrozol, summon one in the fountain at the center of the town. Once your Hydrozol's absorbed the water and grown, pick it up and drop it in front of the boy. Your reward for all the monster wrangling is five Might Crystals.\n\nThe post How to complete A Curious Child quest in Zelda Echoes of Wisdom appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Great Fairy Shrine is located on an island in the middle of the lake.\n\n\nTo get to Lake Hylia, you’ll need to head east from Suthorn Prairie or north from Suthorn Forest. Otherwise, you can reach it by exiting the south gate of Hyrule Castle and heading east. \n\n\nMake sure that you activate the Waypoint outside the entrance to the Great Fairy Shrine before your first visit.

          "description": "Using a controller to play EA FC 25 is highly advisable, but users have encountered certain issues post-launch.\n\n\nUsually, you can use a wide array of controllers on a PC, including third-party offerings. If you own an Xbox or/and a PS, the controllers that come with them can also be used. Unfortunately, the post-launch scenario has witnessed a few issues arising when players have tried to connect their controllers. Thankfully, there are some easy fixes that will allow you to use your controllers without any issues.\n\n\nEA FC 25 PC controller error fixes\n\n\nProblems with controllers are usually caused by the Steam input. This mechanism usually makes it easy for you to use any controller with a PC. Unfortunately, some conflicting issues arise with EA FC 25 on PC. I encountered the same trouble last year, and here are some of the fixes you can try.\n\n\n\nTurn off the Steam Input. I did it last year and have done it again. Go to the properties of EA FC 25 and then to controller settings. From here, you can turn off Steam Input.\n\n\nClose your Steam from the task manager and remove the controller. Connect it once again, and then turn on Steam and the game. This should prevent Steam from connecting to Big Picture by mistake.\n\n\nMake sure you don't have Keyboard and Mouse selected as input methods. The mouse can sometimes interfere with your controller inputs (keep it in the corner to prevent it from randomly popping up in the middle of the screen).\n\n\nGo to Device Manager and select USB controller settings. Change the calibration and then reset it to the default settings.\n\n\n\nUltimately, I hope there will be a permanent fix for the controller issues that pop up on PC every year. The first title update didn't include anything in this regard, but a bigger patch is expected now that the game's worldwide launch is over.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to fix controller not working on PC? appeared first on Destructoid.",
