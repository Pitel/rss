          "description": "So much more than \"Sanrio meets Animal Crossing\".\n“One World, Connecting Smiles.” That’s the tagline Sanrio, the company responsible for creating Hello Kitty, established back in 2021. Its brand is all about 'Minna Nakayoku', which means 'all of us friends' or 'Getting Along Together'. Unity, friendship, and love encompass the world of Sanrio, and it’s worked. For me, Hello Kitty has always been that unifying figure – an icon, kind of like a cuter Barbie, who is capable of anything but always puts her friends first. I had Hello Kitty Dream World figures, where the eponymous cat had a mushroom house, a pineapple juice bar (complete with a pineapple-costumed figure), and even a dolphin yacht. There was also a bee costume figure with detachable bee wings. What’s not to love?\nHello Kitty is one of the biggest brands in the world (for context, Hello Kitty grossed more merch money than Frozen, Batman, and Sesame Street in 2018). So it might be a surprise that she’s never really had a successful video game, despite starring in many, dating all the way back to the Famicom. That is, until 2023’s Hello Kitty Island Adventure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

On another day I might call it the first ever city building game.\nEven a Settlers or Factorio cannot match its extreme focus on logistical simulation. It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts. It is… a lot. It's too much at times. But if you have those times, it will occupy them like nothing else.\nRead more",

In one such chat, Miyazaki strays perilously close to airing the \"themes or core elements\" of whatever game or games FromSoftware are working on post-Elden Ring, commenting that he has been inspired, albeit perhaps in a \"short-term way\", by the experience of having a daughter.\r\n \nRead more",

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster.

It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type.

          "description": "\"Two's company, three's a crowd,\" the saying goes, unless the first two are warriors and the third one is a priest, in which case the superior proverb is surely \"three's a moderately balanced squad, two's a massive liability\"? Here to put such kitchen wisdom to the test is BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which \"only\" allows you to bring two companions into the fray, one fewer than 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities. All this comes care of a BioWare Discord Q&A from late last week, which you can watch in full below.\n Read more",

I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

          "description": "The impenetrable wall of crossover fiction known as Kingdom Hearts has come to Steam. The games have been on Epic Games Store since 2021, so they're not new to PC folk. But this does open them up to players who shy away from Epic's storefront. I use the term \"open up\" loosely, because Kingdom Hearts is popularly regarded as a tangle of criss-crossing JRPG confuse-o-plots that require diagrams and multiple explainer videos to follow. I don't know if that's true, having never followed Alice down this Buster Sword-shaped rabbit hole, but it is the popular joke. And, looking into Goofy's cold, dead eyes, I find I am afraid to question it.\nRead more",

The first Citizen Sleeper saw your bio-robotic protagonist landing on a donut-shaped space station where they learned to make a new life for themselves among interstellar farmers and ramen-serving rapscallions. In the sequel, a demo of which I've played [smug face], the hook is a little different. This time you're being pursued across a bunch of backwater truck stops, colonies, depots, and derelicts.

Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids’ eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don’t seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox RPG Streets of Fortuna, but that’s about the only thing that this ambitious “megasim” appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything open world.\nRead more",

Shot at baddies over rectangular cover layouts. Collected 7/10 pieces of scrap with some Star Wars flavour text that unlocked an item recipe of some kind. Deployed my chibi Chewbacca sidekick Nix to distract Imperials with cute wiggles and belly boops so I could sneak behind them. Got discovered sneaking behind them and murdered them all before one could run to a terminal and summon reinforcements. OK, maybe that last one is getting there.\r\n \nRead more",

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door.

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Microsoft have released a new trailer for South Of Midnight, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Since XDefiant first launched, players have been begging for Team Deathmatch to be added as a game mode. An overwhelming wave of demand worked, as Ubisoft finally confirmed its addition. \n\n\nUbisoft confirmed that Team Deathmatch goes live as a new game mode on June 21 at 10 a.m. PT. Playing the objective is fun and often rewarding when it leads to a victory for your team. However, sometimes, when you log on, you would rather turn your brain off and strictly go after enemies. Team Deathmatch is the perfect game mode for players seeking out that experience.  \n\n\nTeam Deathmatch is a classic first-person shooter game mode in which the only objective is to get as many kills as possible. The winner of the match is the team that reaches the point limit first or the squad that has the most kills at the end of the time limit. As in the case with other titles such as Modern Warfare 3, this game mode will probably be one of the most played game modes when it goes live. \n\n\n\n\nXDefiant features two different types of maps. Arena environments are designed for game modes like Occupy and Hot Shot, as they are smaller and ideal for fast-paced battles. On the other hand, liner maps are more tailored for modes like Escort and Zone Control because the game modes demand a larger battlefield. Ubisoft did not reveal which maps the game mode will be available on, but it will most likely only be available on arena maps, based on the criteria. \n\n\nAs for other highly requested game modes, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin previously confirmed on June 5 that Search and Destroy will be added in a future update. \n\nThe post XDefiant finally confirms Team Deathmatch game mode thanks to community requests appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Less than a day after publisher Paradox Interactive canceled Life by You, the company announced that the game's developer Paradox Tectonic is shutting down.\n\n\nThe news was delivered earlier this morning by the publisher. Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, called the move, which affects 24 people, \"difficult and drastic,\" and shutting down the studio was a \"tough decision.\" \n\n\n\"This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,\" Wester said. \"Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre.\"\n\n\nImage via Paradox Tectonic\n\n\nParadox Tectonic is shutting down after Life by You cancellation\n\n\nParadox announced the cancellation of Life by You yesterday. In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: \"A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release.\" The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down The Lamplighters League for approximately $23 million a week after the game launched. \n\n\nIt has been troubling all around. Paradox Tectonic's shuttering feels like another stone in the road for an industry that has already experienced a lot of job loss in 2024 — and we're only halfway through the year. Just yesterday, before the news of the Life by You cancellation, Embracer Group announced the closure of Alone in the Dark (2024) developer Pieces Interactive. Microsoft closed down the Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin (along with Alpha Dog Games) ahead of its big June showcase.

Naturally, that means the audience was inherently limited, but now that it's finally expanding to other platforms, Sakaguchi shared some thoughts. \n\n\nIn a statement on Fantasian's official English social accounts, Sakaguchi started off by saying that he always wanted Fantasian to be an \"especially long-standing title,\" and he cites that longevity as one of the strengths of digital games. \"I developed Fantasian thinking that it could become my final work before retiring, so it has a special place in my heart,\" he continued. \n\n\n\n\nSakaguchi added that being able to rebuild Fantasian at Square Enix and offer it to a wider audience is \"truly a blessing.\" Beyond the exploration and turn-based combat, a lot of the appeal of Fantasian comes down to its beautifully bespoke nature. The backgrounds consist of hand-crafted dioramas, over 150 of which were scanned into the game. Sakaguchi closed out his statement with a nod to all this loving, laborious work, saying, \"This title is an amalgamation of the souls of the diorama craftsmen, Uematsu compositions, and of course, the game developers.\" \n\n\nThe soul of fantasy\n\n\nScreenshot via Square Enix\n\n\nSquare Enix is helping Sakaguchi and his team revitalize the RPG as Fantasian Neo Dimension.

It's currently set for a 2024 release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\n\nAs great as exclusives can be, it's even better when more people have a chance to enjoy a game you've worked so hard on over the years.

          "description": "In the advent of the new Jade Shadows update, the Evensong is the ‘light’ version of the Dread in Warframe you can score now. It’ll definitely serve more as a utility weapon, but it's still one for bow lovers to keep in their arsenal. \n\n\nIf you’re looking to get your hands on it, then here's everything you need to know to get the Evensong in Warframe's new Jade Shadows update. \n\n\nHow to get the Evensong in Warframe\n\n\nTo get the Evensong in Warframe, you have to farm the new Brutus Ascension mission on Uranus. For now, it’s called Operation: Belly of the Beast. Once the event concludes, it’ll go back to just being Brutus. \n\n\nIn any case, you have to farm Vestigial Motes from this mission so you can then trade them to Ordis. The Evensong costs 300 Motes, so it’ll take a lot until you can amass enough to purchase it.\n\n\nHowever, while playing the new Ascension mission, you do run a slight chance of getting the Evensong in the process. Jade’s signature bow has a 5% chance to drop in this mission, both on the normal and Steel Path modes.\n\n\nEvery new item from the Jade Shadows update has a 5% chance to drop here. Though, with everything having the same probability of dropping, you also may run into multiple drops of the same weapon.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest way to farm the Evensong in Warframe\n\n\nThe best way to farm the Evensong in Warframe is to keep playing the Brutus node on Steel Path until you have gained 300 Vestigial Motes. Enemy drops are better at the cost of a harder difficulty, but it pays off. \n\n\nAlso, reaching 300 specifically is important because, in the time it takes to get those 300 Motes, you may have already snagged a few pieces of the Jade Warframe, the other weapons, or the Evensong. With how many other ways you can get Jade, you can prioritize the motes just for the weapons and Arcanes.\n\nThe post How to get the Evensong in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie sequel will be directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, and the script will be written by Matthew Fogel. The movie will be co-produced by Melendandri and Miyamoto. Universal Pictures will be distributing the movie globally.\n\n\nNintendo and Illumination’s Mario movie was a blockbuster hit as it grossed $1.36 billion at the global box office, made a $559 million profit, and became the most successful video game movie adaptation of all time.\n\nThe post The Super Mario Bros.

That noise is coming from Muir, another member of the rig's crew who has been tragically mutated by whatever the drill crew ran into, and he's lonely. \n\n\nMuir is a towering creature who patrols a large area in search of any surviving crew so he can absorb them into his mass. When you encounter him, he quickly grabs Dobbie before you find Innes, another survivor who tells you where to go. The only way forward is around Muir, so you're going to have to get back to sneaking around and throwing objects to distract him from where you're hiding. \n\n\nHow to get past Muir in Still Wakes the Deep\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThis encounter with Muir is split into a few stages.

          "description": "It wouldn't be a new Warframe update if there weren't a handful of new materials for you to collect. Duviri Paradox is the best example of a recent update that introduced a lot of materials, but each update tends to include a couple. The release of Jade Shadows is no different, and how you can use them can be a little confusing. Here's what Vestigial and Volatile Motes are in Warframe.\n\n\nHow to get and use Vestigial and Volatile Motes in Warframe\n\n\nVestigial and Volatile Motes are acquired from the new Ascension game mode, accessible through the node Brutus, Uranus. During the mission, you'll fight various enemies that will occasionally drop Vestigial or Volatile Motes, which can then be picked up. These come in at a few each run but typically give you more Vestigial Motes than Volatile.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThese need to be taken to the Larunda Relay orbiting Mercury. Once there, you want to head to Ordis, who's found in the Mission Control room on the right side of the relay. Alternatively, you can use the Fast Travel option in the Pause Menu to go straight to Ordis. Here, you're able to access several shops. The Release Vestigial Motes shop lets you access Jade's component blueprints alongside other useful items such as Arcanes. Other shops let you spend your Volatile Motes on other assorted items, including several cosmetics.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nBe mindful that Volatile Motes are only available as part of the Operation: Belly of the Beast event that launched with the Jade Shadows update. Once the Operation disappears, only Vestigial Motes will be earnable. If you want some of the cosmetics in Ordis' shop, you'll need to move fast.\n\nThe post What are Vestigial and Volatile Motes in Warframe? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While not every Warframe update includes one, the updates that include new cinematic quests tend to be the most interesting ones. Between updates like The New War, Whispers in the Walls, and now Jade Shadows stick out more when you need to deal with story tidbits and cool setpieces instead of a new mission type to farm. Here's how to access the latest main story quest for Warframe, known aptly as Jade Shadows.\n\n\nHow to play the Jade Shadows main quest in Warframe\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Jade Shadows quest becomes accessible after completing the New War main quest. This will require a lot of other quests to be completed beforehand, mostly centered around the main story. If you're only partway through, you should focus on that instead of concerning yourself with most of the new update. However, those who have completed The New War can access the quest through the kiosk on the left of the Orbiter's cockpit. Find the Jade Shadows quest in the menu, click on it, and select Begin in the bottom right.\n\n\nIf you are going to jump into the quest, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The mission is 30-40 minutes long depending on how quickly you tend to speed through content. You also won't be able to access the rest of the game until the mission is complete, so you should get anything else you want done taken care of now.\n\n\nUpon completion, you'll get a handful of nice cosmetics along with the Jade main blueprint, granting you access to her provided you have her parts already. If you don't, they can be acquired through the new Ascension game mode on the node Brutus, Uranus.\n\nThe post How to access the Jade Shadows quest in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.\nFor Miyaz…",

While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer.

With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

          "description": "We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

          "description": "Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. \nPieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: \nAlone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. \n\n\nFollowing the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games).

          "description": "Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\nThe first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. \n\n\nStealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). \nInterestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. \nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.\nAlongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. \nPlus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has \"auto rock on,\" an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. \nCheck all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \n For more, read Game Informer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review here. \nAre you going to be playing Chainsaw Lollipop RePop this September?

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update?

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
