          "description": "It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. \r\n\n\r\nWhat I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Flashes of Arkane's brilliance make an appearance, but they are a rare find amidst a bland, incoherent world that clearly points to deeper issues in a game that's been drained of its magic.\nRead more",

And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can't complain!\nThing is, much like with the internet or your mum's relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you're not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As you might expect from a roster of 12 Marvel superheroes (or 17, if you count the four extra DLC supes and its original, player-designed protagonist The Hunter), the lycra-clad buds of Marvel's Midnight Suns all look and feel substantially different from one another when it comes to combat. When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards.

It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes.

Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it's already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That's a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai's turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well? \nRead more",

They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad. \nRead more",

          "description": "For me, developers Deconstructeam are the GOAT at fleshing out characters through the subtle art of conversation. Whether it’s revealing the dark secrets of corporate espionage from the mouths of loose-lipped employees after a cocktail or two in The Red Strings Club, uncovering the cut-throat life of a hitman as he arranges beautiful bouquets in Eternal Home Floristry, or unravelling the personal philosophies of an old man who claims he can speak to God through a radio in Interview With A Whisperer, their games are detailed portraits of complex people. And after playing through an hour-long preview build of the team’s next game, the fresly unveiled The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, I can already tell that this adventure is one of their most complex portraits yet. This time, folks, we're dealing with divination, cosmic gods and sweet, sweet revenge.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel's Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game's combat and dropping the cards entirely. \n\"Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!\" laughs creative director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps \"a little naïve\" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.\nRead more",

          "description": "I don't feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I’ll be fair; it's definitely good.\nI've enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn't were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One billion Switch games sold to date\nNintendo has revealed the newest sales figures regarding its Nintendo Switch platform, which sees the console pass the 125 million unit mark, as well as hitting an all-time record in regards to software sales.\nAccording to the data, 3.07 million Nintendo Switch consoles were sold during the first quarter of 2023, (ending March 31), which pushes total unit sales to 125.62 million. While an additional three million sold Switch consoles is not to be sniffed at, it does represent a huge 22% sales drop on the previous year, continuing a downward trend for Switch hardware sales in general. At this rate, it seems very unlikely that the Switch will surpass the sales of Nintendo's best-selling hardware, Nintendo DS, which closed on a staggering 154 million units — making it the second best selling console of all time.\nNintendo is openly aware of the sales decline, but still hopes to sell a further 15 million units by the end of March 2024. Speaking in a conference call attended by Bloomberg, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa called the target \"a bit of stretch\", but hopes that the holiday season will help the company to hit its targets. Furukawa said that no new or upgraded hardware was being factored into the prediction, somewhat furthering whispers that the company has no plans to release a new edition of the Switch in the near future.\nIn regard to software sales, Switch has shipped 1.036 billion games since its launch, which is the most titles ever shipped for any Nintendo platform. The three best-selling first-party titles remain Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (53.79 million), Animal Crossing: New Horizons (42.21 million), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (31.09 million). Nintendo's next major release, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, launches this week, and is expected to carry the lion's share of the company's software revenue for 2023.\nThe post Nintendo Switch surpasses 125 million sales, but decline trend continues appeared first on Destructoid.",

Access to the library will end on May 9.\nThe PS Plus Collection is a who's who of PS4 hits, and includes titles such as God of War, Batman: Arkham Knight, Bloodborne, Resident Evil 7, The Last of Us Remastered, Until Dawn, Fallout 4, Days Gone, and Monster Hunter: World, among many others. Given the pedigree of the titles on offer,the collection is certainly one of the most inviting aspects of the PlayStation Plus subscription.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEsLzh0xLZc&ab_channel=PlayStation\nSIE confirmed that all registered titles will still be readily available to players after the collection is removed, so be sure to jump in and \"log\" all the games from the PS Plus Collection before the fated date — That way they'll always be available to redownload from the PlayStation Store, because you don't have enough of a backlog already, of course. All titles will also remain available for purchase.\nPlayStation Plus launched its revamped, tier-based subscription service in the summer of 2022. This variant of the classic service, structured to compete with the Xbox Game Pass service, offers PlayStation users access to a variety of brand-new, recent, and classic PlayStation games on a monthly basis, with rotating titles, beta access, and other bonuses.\nThe PS Plus Collection will be removed from the PlayStation Store on May 9.\nThe post Last Call: Sony to remove the PS Plus Collection library in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

The open beta will run from May 19 through May 21, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.\nTo register and take part in the open beta, you'll need to register a Capcom ID and link your platform. You'll want to register early, because chances are high that the initial rush may be a lot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMAao7ooWhY\nThe content in the open beta will be the same as the second closed beta test. That includes avatar creation and character creation (though you can only create once), ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, training mode, the game center, and more.\nEight playable characters will be in the open beta: Luke, Jamie, Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, Kimberly, Juri, and Ken.\nAdditionally, there will be cross-platform play, the special commentary features, and other features too. You can head over to link your ID and pre-register for the open beta here.\nTaking it to the streets\nIt won't be long now until the new Street Fighter gets underway, and by all accounts so far, it's looking pretty strong. The matches I played locally at PAX East left a pretty strong impression on me already. And here's an excerpt of what our resident Street Fighter aficionado Chris Moyse had to say after his recent hands-on:\n\"With Street Fighter 6, Capcom is hoping to see its flagship fighting series, one that defined the genre itself, make a grand challenge for its (lost?) fighting game throne, offering fans old and new a fully-featured and engaging sequel that has learned from the mistakes of its past, while evolving its entire pedigree for a bold and electrifying future.\"\n\nYou'll be able to get a sense of Street Fighter 6 yourself later this month with the open beta, running May 19 through 21. Then, Street Fighter 6 will officially launch on June 2.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 is getting an open beta later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Where to go before a new Hyrule drops\nIt is the week of a new Zelda game, and you might be getting ready by revisiting its predecessor. I'm not surprised to see that a few people I know have been booting Breath of the Wild back up, just in time for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn fact, I've been doing the same. I was looking for a refresher, as well as an excuse to finally try the Champion's Ballad DLC. Sure, I'd dipped back in to do a few shrines here and there. But the bulk of my own Breath of the Wild playtime was around launch, back in 2017. Going back to re-explore Hyrule and uncover any last surprises I missed felt like seeing it anew all over again.\nSo maybe you need some direction on where to go and what to do, or just want a suggestion on something neat to see.

Deep Silver is perhaps best known for handling franchises such as Saints Row and Dead Island, while Ravensourt handles simulations and casual, family-friendly releases. Prime Matter is still in its infancy, having been founded in 2021.\nUnfortunately, in a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Plaion noted that it expects a handful of layoffs as part of the merger plans, but that the move is necessary in order for the label to \"simplify its publishing operations.\" The merger is expected to roll out over the next 12 to 24 months.\nPlaion is restructuring, layoffs planned [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Plaion restructure to merge Prime Matter, Deep Silver, and Ravenscourt appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Look as hot as The Nurse\nIn an interesting, but somewhat unnerving, piece of merchandising, Konami has announced that it will be teaming with make-up, erm, maker Vampyre Cosmetics in order to produce a line of cosmetic products based upon the Drop Dead Gorgeous world of *checks notes* Silent Hill.\nWhile absolutely no images or even hints were offered up as to what the line of items will include, the comical nature of a Silent Hill cosmetics line writes itself, given the series drab, grim, and disgusting look. Are you expecting a palette of rusted metals, fog greys, and rotted flesh reds? I kid, of course, but it will genuinely be interesting to see how the grisly, depressing world of Silent Hill is reproduced in a beauty line. Vampyre Cosmetics, as the name suggests, is pretty sharp at adapting the darker side of make-up, so I'm looking forward to seeing what is eventually produced.\nhttps://twitter.com/TeamSilentHill/status/1654521071326863360?s=20\nThis is, of course, a pretty big year for the missing-in-action survival horror franchise. As revealed during the Fall 2022 Silent Hill Transmission stream, there are currently multiple projects in production at Konami, including Christophe Gans’ live-action movie Return to Silent Hill, streaming series Silent Hill: Ascension, Annapurna spin-off Silent Hill: Townfall and, of course, Bloober Team's incoming remake of 2001 classic Silent Hill 2. So you can paint yourself up in the new line of Vampyre Cosmetics, and perhaps, if your make-up skills match mine, you can be the scariest thing in town.\nSilent Hill 2 is currently in development for PS5 and PC.\nThe post Silent Hill is teaming with Vampyre Cosmetics for new… make-up line? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Capitalism and Crypto breaks all\nThis weekend saw UDON Comics publish the first issue of Street Fighter 6, a new comic that acts as a prologue to the events of Capcom's upcoming sequel — Issue #1, which is available to download for free right here, follows the journey of Ken Masters, as he visits the worryingly militant district of Nayshall.\nKen is bringing his conglomerate, The Masters Foundation, to the recently founded nation in order to run a lucrative fighting tournament, working alongside the nation's sinister minister Johann Petrovich, known to most as simply \"JP\". Ken is not quite the man he used to be, however. Not only is he estranged from his wife, Eliza, but he is worrying the board of his foundation, having divulged company funds into unstable markets, such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMoreso, Ken has been neglecting his growing son, Mel, who in the issue has been offloaded on PMC cop and SF6 poster boy, Luke Sullivan. If all of this wasn't enough, Ken is quickly learning that Nayshall, the locale for his latest pipe dream, is hardly the free-est of states, plagued with violent revolution over its recent gentrification. This has brought anger to the nation's people — anger that Mr. Masters is set to face first-hand.\nThe first issue not only gives fans a little insight into the politics of Nayshall itself, but also introduces us to the frightening JP, gives us a little time with Luke, (I just don't like the dude), and sets the paving for the events that will lead to Ken's rough fall from grace. Yer boy is going to need some serious guidance, and soon. Hopefully, he'll eventually get it, perhaps delivered in the vessel of his dearest friend and rival.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.  Be sure to check out our recent report on a full build, the internet’s joy at Cammy’s new friend, and the 10 characters that I think who make a fine fit as post-launch DLC.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 prologue comic sees Ken Masters losing himself appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a good horror set-up: you are the livestock, penned into the town of Redfall, and you will either fight or be food.\nIt's not too long after the introduction that I started to feel those drives fall by the wayside, though. There are pieces of Arkane Austin here, from immersive elements and storytelling to a generally interesting stylistic direction.

Power took the points in each and every category — including Sneak Peek, Public Vote, Open Play, Pro Play, and Tricolor — though it should be noted that Wisdom and Courage both held their own in each category. It was a close call, despite Power's clean sweep.\nhttps://twitter.com/SplatoonNA/status/1655396316925644801?s=20\nThis splatfest was, of course, held in order to promote the release of Nintendo's biggest game of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which launches later this week exclusively on Nintendo Switch. Splatoon has been used by Nintendo in the past to smartly cross-promote its other releases, such as Pokemon and Super Mario, and has, from time to time, teamed with other brands for special sponsored splatfests.\nThis latest victory continues to push Splatoon 3 host Shiver's lead, as she claims her fourth victory of seven total splatfests to date.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

And while its 18-strong launch roster is packed out with colorful design and charismatic personas, these World Warriors are truly brought to life thanks to the talented efforts of its (surprisingly large) voice cast.\nWhile the following list contains many veteran SF voice actors, such as Jessica Strauss, Caitlin Glass, Peter Beckman, and Kyle Herbert, we also welcome names that, while perhaps new to the world of Street Fighter, are already very notable in the general field of voice acting.

          "description": "Feeling Catty\nCapcom has quietly issued a brand new trademark for the unannounced title Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Islands, suggesting that the Japan-only PSP release, Airu de Puzzle, may be getting dusted off for an all-new worldwide release. The trademark was filed with multiple international licensors.\nAs noted by Gematsu, Airu de Puzzle is a cute, block puzzle title that launched on PlayStation Portable (PSP) way back in 2012). The fun handheld title has players battle it out in typical block-busting action, championed by the adorable feline friends of the Monster Hunter franchise. The backstory sees the characters, (and even some of the monsters), of Airu village gather together for an exciting puzzle festival, which will also, conveniently, provide plenty of the mythical energy to bring prosperity back to the island.\nYou can check out the original trailer for the PSP release below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkjSRmqcnGU&ab_channel=CapcomChannel\nNow, to be clear, this is just hearsay, but the new title of Felyne Islands sure sounds like a localization of the 2012 release, unless Capcom is planning to build a brand-new title from scratch. Given the newfound love of Monster Hunter on a global scale, it would make sense that the developer might simply be mining its back catalog for timeless titles that would most certainly sell in 2023, perhaps when afforded just a little HD polish. Either way, we'll be sure to give you the heads-up when Felyne Isles is officially announced, in whatever form it eventually presents itself.\nCapcom trademarks Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Isles worldwide [Gematsu]\nThe post Capcom files trademark for Monster Hunter Puzzles: Felyne Isles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Demons? Nah, both). Tecmo Knight is ably assisted by his tiger pal, \"Tiger\", who absolutely isn't Cringer, and Smokeman, a deity who provides additional attacks and abilities.\nAdditionally, Tecmo Knight can call upon the power of a dragon, who can defeat any opponent with a single blast of fiery breath. Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Punch Pedia.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWHuuRt_lho&ab_channel=PunchPedia\nWhile Tecmo Knight at first glance appears to be Tecmo's take on Sega's own hit, Golden Axe, (and in many ways it is), Tecmo's offering is a little more finicky and precise in its controls, ala Ninja Gaiden, which makes it a trickier challenge and thus kept it from becoming a truly well-remembered classic.\nOh, and like Ninja Gaiden, it has an anxiety-inducing Continue? screen, which sees the Tecmo Knight being eaten by a giant monster as he screams in pain. Failing to add a credit in time sees a helmeted beast hack through the screen, yelling \"NO FUTURE!\" like a 1978 British punk. A famously violent attract sequence was also ultimately censored before release, with further bloodletting, (decapitations in particular), ensuing throughout the game.\nTecmo Knight is definitely worth checking out, though it certainly lacks the pace and energy of other brawlers of the day. It is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post Fantasy scrapper Tecmo Knight charges the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

There will also be \"more livestream content\" as part of the countdown to the midnight release.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1654531865762463772\nYou can tune in live through Nintendo's site here. No exact confirmation on what will be shown, outside of more footage of Tears of the Kingdom gameplay.\nWhat mysteries still remain\nThat might seem a bit impatient, but hey, we still have many things to learn about in Tears of the Kingdom. Why Ganondorf looks so dehydrated and then gets re-hydrated, for example. Or what's up with all those islands in the sky. Plus, I would like to get some ideas for wacky contraptions to slap together with Link's new magical hand powers.\nHopefully, for the folks at home, the midnight release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will also include the digital version unlocking sometime around then too. Either way, it does look like we're ramping up into one of the year's big releases, with some big expectations behind it.

          "description": "The game formerly known as We Are OFK\nYou might remember a certain indie-pop miniseries game called We Are OFK, which started in August 2022 and released episodes up through Sept. 8. OFK is getting a rebrand today, as the developer is changing the name of its episodic adventure to Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story.\nAnnounced in a post today from the group's Twitter account, the band announces that its origin story game has a new name.\n\"We feel #PopLovePanic fits our story better!\" said the band. \"'We Are OFK' had a 'If You Know You Know' vibe, and we wanna be better about reaching out to people who haven’t already heard of our band.\"\nThe name change coincides with a sale on Steam, where you can get the full run of Pop. Love. Panic! for 30% off at the moment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2iKC4fVDs\nWhat's in a name?\nThough it sounds strange, changing the name of a game isn't as uncommon an experience as you'd think. I started back-searching instances in which this has happened, and found plenty of recent examples. Inti Creates retitled Grim Guardians to Gal Guardians in March, and Ubisoft changed Gods & Monsters to Immortals: Fenyx Rising prior to its release. That's not even accounting for the differences in titles between regions, like how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios is now doing away with the Western Yakuza moniker and unifying the series under Like a Dragon.\nAs for OFK and Pop. Love. Panic! The OFK Story, I hope the rebrand works well. We Are OFK has been on my backlog since reviews seemed warm on it. Though some were confused by the concept—an interactive fiction telling the origin story of a band, like video games meets The Gorillaz—it's unique and interesting. Whether OFK has more discography planned or not, it does seem like they've done something a bit outside the box already.\nThe post Indie music tale We Are OFK changes its name to Pop. Love. Panic!

Here's the full statement:\nPlayStation Studios regularly evaluates its portfolio and the status of studio projects to ensure they meet the organization’s short and long-term strategic objectives. As part of a recent review process, it has been decided that PixelOpus will close on June 2.\n\nStudio members have been sharing their sentiments on social media, lamenting the \"loss of a great team, and a great project.\" The studio had previously been working on an unannounced project within PlayStation Studios.\nThe opus comes to a close\nPixelOpus was established in 2014 as a new in-house studio for Sony Interactive Entertainment. The team went on to make 2014's Entwined and then, in 2019, released Concrete Genie. The latter was fairly well-received.\nWe described it in our review as a lower-stakes adventure that was good for unwinding, and it had a pretty cool idea in its supernatural-graffiti concept.

This follows a release on Xbox consoles in April 2022 and on NES in 2010.\nBattle Kid: Fortress of Peril is one of the more beloved homebrew titles for Nintendo’s classic console. Developed by Sivak Games and drawing inspiration from Mega Man and I Wanna Be The Guy, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is a die-and-retry gauntlet.\nhttps://youtu.be/4vvMLR-17Jo\nI actually own a copy of the NES title from its initial run with RetroUSB. Personally, I didn’t really love the game. However, I do recognize it as a quality homebrew project. I’ve played quite a bit of homebrew, and they’re extremely hit-and-miss, with the majority landing in the miss category. Often, they’re first-time projects for programmers, and I can really appreciate the passion behind them, even if I own a few that I can’t stand. I’m not naming any names. It’s mostly just that I rarely enjoy the die-and-retry genre, with Hotline Miami being one of the few I really love.\nStill, I don’t regret having that transparent green NES cartridge on my shelf. Homebrew has come a long way in the last decade. More and more companies have been getting into production. It warms my dusty, old heart.\nIn any case, I’m happy to see that Battle Kid: The Fortress of Peril isn’t staying locked on the hardware. The title is especially a good fit for the Switch, as it’s a console with a very pick-up-and-play mentality.\nIf you’re not into the Switch version or don’t want to wait, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, or via ROM from itch.io.\nThe post Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril moves to Switch on May 19 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased on PC April 21, 2020, No One Lives Under the Lighthouse is a short-form horror that sees you taking over the duties at a lighthouse after the previous keeper went missing. Presented in terrifying PS1-o-vision, you’re tasked with unraveling the mystery while also tending to the needs of the titular lighthouse. It’s estimated at two hours long, which is usually a good mark for these sorts of games.\nhttps://twitter.com/PuppetCombo/status/1654476492326285318?s=20\nI actually bought No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on Steam, but haven’t gotten around to playing this. I’d probably prefer to stick with the PC version, but these sorts of games do tend to be a good fit for consoles.\nAlso, while I don’t believe Puppet Combo had any involvement with the development of the game, having their publishing label, Torture Star Video, handle the distribution of it is a good fit. Both brands are pretty synonymous with lo-fi horror, so it’s a good way to get more eyes on the title. Especially when it’s alongside games like Nun Massacre and Murder House.\nTorture Star Video has promised that it will be bringing more games to console in the near future.\nNo One Lives Under the Lighthouse is currently available on PC. It will be coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox SeriesX|S, and Switch on May 18, 2023.\nThe post Torture Star Video publishing No One Lives Under the Lighthouse on console May 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The truth will be revealed in time\nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie is a bit different from Don't Nod's previous work. It's not the setting, as the studio is well-known for supernatural mysteries, whether it's Life is Strange, Tell Me Why, or others. It's the look of Harmony, and the form the story takes, that make this a peculiar and intriguing new story for Don't Nod.\nRight away, the difference is felt in Harmony's opening. It's gorgeously animated, as protagonist Polly sets out for the day, surround by near-future tech. There's a cutting-edge world pinned up against homes made in emptied pools that really sets a tone early on. Polly's returned home to help search for her missing mother, Ursula, but soon gets swept up in much more than she bargained for in the Reverie.\nhttps://www.youtube.co…",

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead.

The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below. \n\n\nPlanet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay. The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.",

This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

          "description": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn’t running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update. \nThe PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering\" in the patch notes. \nThat doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:\nMultiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.\nFixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.\nPerformance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nFixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis\nFixed various rendering issues.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.\nFixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.\nFixed various collision issues.\nFixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.\nFixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.\nFixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.\nFixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. \nHopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you’re playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today’s update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.",

Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. \nThe film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, and Jurassic World Dominion. \nFor more on The Super Mario Bros. Movie, check out our review of the film here. You can also check out our interviews with the film’s cast as well as Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto and Koji Kondo. \n[Source: Variety]",

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

It's up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that's what the game is about.\nAs a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it's nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.\n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Afterimage, Crash Team Rumble, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Exoprimal, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse, Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, and more.",

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?
