The voyages of the starships Enterprise et al. are journeys of self-discovery. It's about the people we meet on those strange new worlds and what they teach us about ourselves. It's not about taking turns to phaser each other in the face. Despite issues elsewhere, that's where Star Trek: Legends really fails.\nIt's not all bad, though. Emerald City Games' turn-based trawl, published here by Qubic Games, debuted on Apple Arcade back in 2021 and though some may baulk at its mobile-first design, it translates fairly well to Switch.

Don't get us wrong, we'd absolutely bloomin' love a new entry, but we'd honestly rather see the likes of F-Zero and Chibi-Robo! make their grand return on the Switch or its upcoming successor.\nRegardless of whether or not you agree with us on this, it sounds like the Punch-Out!! series may well be dead and buried for good; at least with regards to developer Next Level Games. The lastest mainline entry, simply called Punch-Out!!, launched for the Wii in May 2009 with a WiiWare game entitled Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! following just a handful of months later. Thanks to the criticism levelled toward the former's use of stereotypical characters, however, it sounds like Nintendo isn't prepared to commence work on a new title anytime soon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The rules of this cute minigame are simple: choose a dog, place a bet, and win big if your pick performs well. The unspoken rule is that you never pick the lone blue dog. Why? Because the blue dog never wins. At least, that's what we thought.\nBlue dog's racing abilities are poor, to say the least. No matter how many times we've played the minigame ourselves or watched others take part in speedruns, the colourful canine never seems to bring back top dollar. We were content to live with this fact (not everyone is cut for racing royalty, after all), but a handful of Majora fans dared to think more positively. If you can teach an old dog new tricks, then surely blue dog can get a win.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ahead of Nintendo's expected announcement before the end of March, new images have appeared online that seem to reveal the successor's motherboard.\nPosted on Reddit by MHN1994 (who has since stated that they are not the original leaker and had actually found the images on Facebook), the post's legitimacy is certainly up for debate (though many have rightly pointed out the comparisons to a previous leak showcasing alleged prototype components of the Switch 2), but the internet has gone wild with speculation on what this means for the upcoming console regardless.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

          "description": "It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient \"Chinese-style\" RPG The Bustling World. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally. \r\n \nRead more",

And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.\nThe newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

          "description": "At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.\nAlso, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.\n Read more",

          "description": "Now that the holidays are over, the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits on Roblox is a bit trickier to find. However, it's still possible to discover, even solo. This is the best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits now that the holiday event is over.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to find the Prehistoric Island solo\n\n\nThe best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits if playing solo is with the use of Permanent Buddha and Portal buffs. With the event ending, there's no more permanent easily accessible Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits, but it can still be found. If you want to search for it solo, it's best to do so with the Permanent Buddha and Permanent Portal buffs, as they make the process much faster and easier, but they can only be acquired with Robux. Ironically enough, both are available right now as a bundle for 2,999 Robux in the Blox Fruits shop.\n\n\nHop in your ship, and begin your search for the Prehistoric Island. This is best done with the Sentinel ship, though any will do. Because your goal here is to search before it spawns elsewhere, you want to escape to the Portal Dimension if any Sea Event spawns in the area you are searching. For example, if you see a Sea Beast pop out of the water, just pop your Dimensional Rift portal, and then immediately jump out. Any Sea Events that spawned near you will have respawned from this helpful trick. If you take damage from Piranhas while escaping to the Portal Dimension, feel free to stay in there a little longer and heal up.\n\n\nBy making use of your ability to instantly teleport to the Portal Dimension, you can escape any Sea Event while searching for the Prehistoric Island, which is what makes this possible solo. Of course, you'll still need some good RNG to actually find the location of the Prehistoric Island before it respawns elsewhere, but by being able to escape the many Sea Events on the open sea, you can successfully continue to search for it.\n\n\n\nThe post How to find Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

To begin, you'll have to talk with Santa Claus NPC and follow the next set of instructions. Let's take a look at how to get the Candy Cutlass Blade and what's the easiest way to do so.\n\n\nHow to obtain the Candy Cutlass in A Universal Time (AUT)\n\n\nThe first step is to go to the center of the town, and you'll find Santa Claus behind a blue-colored wall. The next step is to defeat 20 Hooligans. Go to the eastern part of the map, and you'll find an empty Skate Park to find them (they will have 'Hooligan' mentioned in their title, along with their levels). You can defeat them quite easily, just make sure not to get stunned by their attacks.\n\n\nThe next step involves obtaining the Candy Cutlass Blade by defeating the Grumpus Boss.\n\n\nHow to Defeat Grumpus in A Universal Time (AUT)\n\n\n\n\nYou can meet the Grumpus Boss in the Ice Fortress, and he spawns once every 45 minutes. You'll have to talk with Bawxstar NPC at the Christmas Tree, and he will take you to the Ice Fortress. The Grumpus has two types of attacks.\n\n\nHis ground slam is pretty strong, but you can completely evade it with the correct timing. The other attack type is a set of punches with short range, and you can also dodge them quite easily.\n\n\nTo make matters easier, you can play as a group. In that case, make sure to do at least 10% damage to be eligible for the rewards. Defeating the Grumpus doesn't necessarily guarantee the blade, so be prepared to repeat the process.\n\n\nOnce you get back the blade, take it to the Santa Claus NPC, and he will change it to the Candy Cutlass with a fresh set of moves.\n\nThe post How to get the Candy Cutlass in A Universal Time (AUT) Christmas Update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a twist that would make the series' protagonist proud, Netflix has seemingly shot itself in one of its many tentacles by accidentally revealing the release date for Squid Game's third and final season.\n\n\nNetflix has recently released a preview for the third season. It features the few remaining survivors and a new doll which will likely be even more of a pain in the ass than the one from the red-and-green-light game that we all hate to love. But, more importantly, it closes off with the promise that the show will return in 2025.\n\n\n\n\nThe teaser also did, however, reveal more than it likely intended to, as Netflix Korea's account seemingly leaked the news that Season 3 would launch on June 27, 2025. Though this might be Netflix messing around with fans, it's highly unlikely, as nobody really stands to gain anything from a false release date.\n\n\nThis is huge news for two very important reasons. Squid Game's second season immediately had the strongest opening week in the history of Netflix, which is naturally a tremendous deal. Secondly, the second season, though incredibly fun and intense, leaves viewers hanging. Season two feels like it was either created as the first half of the final season or as something Netflix released just to quench fans' thirst. Season two ends on a huge cliffhanger, so fans will likely be happy to know they seemingly won't have to wait two more years for the series to reach its conclusion.\n\n\nYou can now watch Netflix's highly successful second season of Squid Game on Netflix, which will hopefully conclude on June 27.\n\nThe post Squid Game’s final season release date accidentally revealed by Netflix appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Wuthering Waves' All Silent Souls Can Sing update, also known as Version 2.0, introduced the Rinascita region, new Resonators to unlock, and the ability to change Rover's appearance. You can now change Rover's gender, but there are some limitations with how often you can access this feature.\n\n\nHow to change Rover's gender in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nAs of Wuthering Waves 2.0, you can change Rover's appearance by heading into Settings, Other, and Player Settings. You'll spot a section titled \"Switch Appearance,\" letting you swap between Rover's two models every 24 hours. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAfter you confirm the selection, the game will initially send you back to the log-in screen before returning to your new character model.\n\n\nSince there's a 24-hour grace period for changing Rover's appearance, you won't be able to freely swap between them to compare both forms or change them between cutscenes. Once you switch over, you're locked into your new form until 24 hours pass, letting you swap back if you're unhappy with your initial choice.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAside from Rover's appearance changing, there's no significant difference between Rover's two character models. They use the same weapon and have the same stats, Resonance options, and Fortes, with the only difference being their looks. Which version you use is entirely up to you and won't impact gameplay whatsoever. \n\n\nWhat does change, though, is cutscenes, attack animations, and character interactions. You'll appear as your newly chosen form in various cutscenes throughout Wuthering Waves' story, and you'll find a few minor differences in how your character moves.\n\nThe post How to change between male and female Rover genders in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not many hours are left for the NumeroFUT promo to go live in EA FC 25, and the first set of leaks has hinted at the special cards coming soon to Ultimate Team.\n\n\nNumeroFUT will be a new addition to Ultimate Team as this campaign hasn't been seen in older Ultimate Teams. Naturally, there are plenty of reasons to be excited, but EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about the promo cards as of writing. Only the release date has been confirmed, and if you're looking to find out more about the cards, you'll need to rely on the social media leaks and rumors. \n\n\nComplete list of EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo players\n\n\nUnlike Winter Wildcards, NumeroFUT won't be having any special set of Heroes and Icons. It will only include promo cards for active footballers, and a few big names have already been leaked. \n\n\n\nRafael Leao\n\n\nRobert Lewandowski\n\n\nJames Maddison\n\n\nEduardo Camavinga\n\n\nJonathan Tah\n\n\nJames Rodriguez\n\n\nPedro Neto\n\n\nDusan Vlahovic\n\n\nLeon Goretzka\n\n\nMapi Leon\n\n\nJill Roord\n\n\nMillie Bright\n\n\nGoncalo Ramos\n\n\nEvan Ndicka\n\n\nLuuk de Jong\n\n\nMinge\n\n\nJess Fishlock\n\n\nLewis Dunk\n\n\nBilly Gilmour\n\n\nDante\n\n\nBourdieu\n\n\nDavid Lopez\n\n\nBalerdi\n\n\nDouglas Augusto\n\n\nBeattie\n\n\n\nMore names are expected to be added as the release date gets closer. Once we have more leaks, the names will be added to this list. James Rodriguez could be an interesting addition since he's been reintroduced to Ultimate Team only recently. Just like Juan Mata and David De Gea, we could get this first special card during the upcoming campaign.\n\n\nNumeroFUT will go live on Friday, January 3, at 6 p.m. UK time when the special cards will be added to the packs. A few items are also expected to be released via SBCs and objectives, so make sure to be on the lookout for those. Additionally, Season 4 rewards also feature a few NumeroFUT items with Marco Asensio available as early as level 11. That's a great way to stack your club with a few promo items for free. \n\nThe post All EA FC 25 NumeroFUT promo player leaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

To evolve Griffin, you'll need Periapt of the King to access him first. Let's take a look at how to get this item in the first place.\n\n\nHow to get Egg of the King in Anime Adventures\n\n\nSo far, the only known way to find Egg of the King is by using a Summoning Circle. The odds will be low as it's a Mythic item. Odds-wise, you can obtain it from any available banners, but the Special one will have better chances with a 2x Mythic boost. Do note that it's a matter of luck, and you may require a lot of diamonds to make the rolls.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no sure-shot way to obtain this item, which would certainly have been nice. Nevertheless, the item isn't tied to a time-limited event, so you can have your fair share of tries even if initially unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the Periapt of the King in Anime Adventures\n\n\nAs I said earlier, the Periapt of the King is closely associated with the Eggs of Sacrifice that you can find in Anime Adventures. The Egg of the King will be available in your items stash, and you can also search for it using its name. Once you select the item and decide to use it, a red portal will open, leading you to the Griffin NPC location. From there, you can use the Eggs of Sacrifice to evolve him.\n\n\nIf you're unsure how to get Eggs of Sacrifice, check this guide out. As with Egg of the King, the Eggs of Sacrifice will also require concentrated efforts and a long time to find. You can also sacrifice Mythic items to quicken the process, but you'll lose those units permanently.\n\nThe post Anime Adventures Periapt of the King guide: How to get Egg of the King appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

To všechno funguje velmi dobře. Ale je to proloženo otravnou hrou, kde pořádně nefunguje boj, stealth ani puzzly, a jejíž interaktivita zdržuje od toho cool příběhu.",

          "description": "Za pár dní má v našich kinech (a po celém světě) premiéru \"remasterovaná verze\" kultovní animované podívané Interstella 5555. A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",

Přestože mám muzikály rád, téměř vůbec se u mě nedostavil jakýkoliv pocit dojetí nebo jiná silná emoce a z písniček si téměř nic nepamatuji.
