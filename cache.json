          "description": "Not so shining.\nIt’s always difficult to know just how much of a game to change when you’re remaking it, and that is certainly true when it comes to the insanely-popular Pokémon series. Go too far, and you risk alienating the audience, as was evident with the enjoyable but somewhat simplified Let’s Go! Pikachu and Eevee Switch remakes of the original Pokémon Red and Blue. If you manage to combine the elements that have advanced the formula in the years since, though, you can create some of the very best games in the franchise, as was the case with HeartGold and SoulSilver on DS. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl fall somewhere in the middle; a pair of titles that offers a great opportunity to pick up some of the Sinnoh Dex that is missing from the current mainline Sword and Shield games, but ultimately an adventure you probably won’t return to once you're done.\nThere’s a strange feeling of obligation to these remakes. Generation 1, 2 and 3 have all received stellar reimaginings, and Generation 4 felt like the odd one out. However, instead of a Game Freak-helmed remake and love letter to the generation, ILCA, the studio handling Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, has changed the art style for the worse and failed to include many elements from the generation’s best game, Pokémon Platinum.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It turns out that it's closer than originally thought, now due to arrive on the eShop on 2nd December priced at $15.99USD (and regional equivalents), but with 20% off on pre-orders.\nDeveloped by GAGEX (which is known for feel good and nostalgic games), it's a narrative adventure game that adopts blocky voxel-style visuals - think The Touryst but with a calmer colour palette. On mobile it's had plenty of positive reviews, while the game has also won various awards on the Japanese scene. It involves a bit of time travel, a 'Back to the Future'-esque quest and a setting of 1980s Tokyo suburbs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A chaser.\nThe weight of expectation can be a terrible thing for a game. When you expect nothing, every moment has the potential to offer a surprise and an unanticipated feeling of discovery, and the original Toree 3D benefited from absolute zero expectations when it launched back in April. Releasing out of nowhere for a bargain basement price, Diplodocus Games served up a very short but exceptionally sweet low-poly platformer. It was rudimentary, yes, but far bigger, far more expensive 3D platformers have failed to nail the fundamentals like developer Siactro did with Toree, and it was a wonderful and very welcome surprise.\nToree 2, a similarly-sized and priced sequel, feels more-or-less like a level pack for the first game (which incidentally got an update with extra levels to coincide with this game's launch), so we recommend reading our mini review of that pint-sized platformer — it's the same hold-'Y'-to-dash 3D platforming deal as before. Describing it as a glorified level pack might sound like a negative, but it's the sort of thing a developer can get away with when they're only charging $0.99 / £0.89, and Siactro does throw in some new elements here.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. \r\n\n\r\nIndiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.\nAs a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.\nRead more",

          "description": "Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you're left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you're meant to proceed. It wouldn't be much of a puzzle game if there weren't a few moments like this, of course, but when you're playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you're really desperate, an in-game video solution). \nWhen the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.\nRead more",

It's a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season's Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there's yer preamble.\nBut the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, \"This is Frogwares' world and we're all just living in it!\" and, \"What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. \nObviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.\nRead more",

I'm not sure I ever will, either. \nIt's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong.

From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.\nUsing lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game. \r\n\n \nRead more",

When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.\r\n\n\nConway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.\r\n\n\r\nWithin these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting.

This is a familiar World War 2 funfair, where you’re steered through artillery strikes and down swathes of enemies like its whack-a-mole. By the time you get off, it’s all blurred into one forgettable experience. How could you emerge shellshocked, when you’ve seen it all before?\nRead more",

In previous updates, Capcom has shown footage of mocap sessions, shared design insights, and music/merch collaborations, along with the gameplay breakdowns.\nThe #SFVFallUpdate is coming your way!\n#SFV digital event with a behind-the-scenes look at Season 5’s final character, Luke! ⭐\nhttps://t.co/Go1l4a4TKF pic.twitter.com/DgjqCpizij\nNovember 17, 2021\nLuke was revealed in August to be the last addition of the Season 5 character pass and Street Fighter V as a whole, following a parade of returning favorites from Street Fighter and adjacent series Rival Schools. In the event where he was revealed, Street Fighter V's developers described Luke as a glimpse at the future of the series. He's dressed for a fight with MMA gear, including lightweight gloves and sponsor-laden trunks.

          "description": "If you’ve ever wanted your palico or palamute in Monster Hunter Rise to look like Sonic and Tails, now’s your chance. \nThat’s because Sonic and Tails are (kinda) coming to Monster Hunter Rise in a new collaboration that goes live on November 26. The official Monster Hunter Twitter account posted a one-minute video today featuring the groovy basslines you’ve come to expect from Sonic music alongside footage of palico Sonic and palamute Tails in-game. \nOH YEAH! @Sonic_Hedgehog collaboration coming in FAST!\n#MHRise players starting November 26. pic.twitter.com/7yu9vyN8Et\nNovember 17, 2021\nLook, I’m not Sonic expert but I have to be honest: palico Sonic works so much better than palamute Tails. The palico actually looks like the blue dude who likes to go fast – you could convince me that’s just actually him. The palamute, however, looks like a dog that someone’s dressed up to be like Tails. I don’t know if any of this matters to players – it probably doesn’t – but if I’m going for the full gold rings experience, I’m rolling with Sonic. \nIt’s cool regardless that both are in-game; it's even cooler that the palico can seemingly turn into Super (Saiyan) Sonic too. \nAs noted in the announcement video, this Monster Hunter Rise x Sonic The Hedgehog collaboration will go live on November 26. That day, an event quest will go live and it yields not just the palico and palamute armor pieces as rewards, but some Hunter armor as well. Complete this quest and your entire squad can roll out at the speed of sound in style. This collaboration will hit the PC version when it launches in January. \nWhile waiting for this collaboration to go live, check out Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then read where Monster Hunter Rise ended up on this year’s Game Awards nomination list. Read about how Monster Hunter Rise won’t have cross-save or crossplay with Switch when it hits PC this coming January.\nWill you be jumping back into Monster Hunter Rise to check out this collaboration?

          "description": "The studio behind the Yakuza series and the Judgment series, Ryu Ga Gotoku, is working on a new franchise, but it won’t be connected to either of their beloved crime-related series. \nThis news comes from Video Games Chronicle, which reports that studio director Masayoshi Yokohama told Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that RGG is planning a new game separate from the Yakuza or Judgment series. \n“We’re also working on unannounced titled outside of [Yakuza and Judgment],” Yokoyama told Famitsu. \nIf you’re worried about not getting more Yakuza as a result, though, don’t fret – RGG has already confirmed that a sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon is in the works, even though series creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has departed from Sega. The future of the Judgment series, however, is not so guaranteed. As noted by VGC, after an alleged dispute between Sega and lead actor Takuya Kimura’s talent agency, it’s unclear if the series even has its leading actor to rely on for the role of Takayuki Yagami. \nYokoyama said RGG “will continue to cherish the Judgment series” when talking to Famitsu, so that’s something. Only time will tell what comes of it, but now we know a new franchise is in the works at the studio.\nWhile waiting to learn more about it, check out Game Informer’s Lost Judgment review and then read Game Informer’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon review.

          "description": "Dying Light 2 has been one of my most anticipated games of the year for, well, three years now. It all started in 2019 when I saw a beyond-impressive gameplay demo at E3. The game, then scheduled for a 2020 release, blew away my already-high expectations. I enjoyed the original Dying Light, but felt that with a little bit of iteration and polish, the series could evolve into something truly special. Those hopes were delivered upon during that E3 2019 demo, and Dying Light 2 skyrocketed up my list of the most anticipated games of 2020.\nSadly, in the early stages of last year, Techland announced a delay to 2021. Then, after announcing a December 2021 release date, the developer delayed the game one (hopefully) final time, with the title now scheduled to release on February 4, 2022. It's been…",

Developer Techland's ambitious open-world title has the potential to wow players with meaningful choices, a beautiful space to cause chaos, and satisfying zombie slaying. While Dying Light 2 has stayed in the shadows for the majority of the last few years, today, we're giving you a new look into this undead nightmare.\nThat's right, join Brian Shea and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a tour of Techland's next title. The aforementioned Mr. Shea got to go to his first in-person press event in two years to get hands-on with both the PS4 Pro version of the game along with the beefed-up PC version.\nDuring today's fresh episode of New Gameplay Today, the gents show off Dying Light 2's improved combat system and discuss how the game has improved since the original. They also dive into the famous parkour and detail how players will be able to use new gear like the paraglider to help them get around the expansive and terrifying open world. We also dive into a bit of the story, including what actor Rosario Dawson's character will be doing, but nothing that would overtly spoil any major story beats. The duo unpacks a lot more, but you're going to have to watch the latest NGT to learn more.\nIf you enjoyed our latest look at Dying Light 2 Stay Human, be sure to check out Brian Shea's written impressions of his time with Techland's latest title ahead of its February 4, 2022 release date!

According to Video Games Chronicle, 343’s popular FPS space opera amassed over 270,000 concurrent players on Steam, the first Xbox Studios game to reach such notable player-count heights in such a short period. \nThis feat is even more impressive when considering the surprise announcement (sure, rumors might’ve been circulating over the weekend) during yesterday’s 20th Anniversary stream. While progression carrying over to the base game – acquired cosmetics, battle pass unlocks, and general experience points – and the Halo namesake are central selling points, it was hard to gauge where the player-count numbers would wind up. Yet (as seen below), other acclaimed Xbox Studios titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection, while very successful in their own right, have not seen the same immediate success on Steam. \nHalo Infinite is now the first ever Xbox Studios Game to pass 200k+ concurrent players on Steam and set the all-time record\npic.twitter.com/IRqKU67MKY\nNovember 15, 2021\nHalo Infinite is in good company, having the fourth largest player peak on Monday under Steam heavyweights like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and PUBG. Developer 343 Industries has a lot to be happy about. \nTotals on Xbox and the PC app haven’t been confirmed yet. Still, it’s safe to assume that the latest multiplayer installment in the Halo franchise is being enjoyed by a bevy of players on all available platforms. With news of the Season One battle pass extending until next May – an unorthodox amount of time, quite frankly – fans should have a ton of additional content rollouts to supplement the already-strong multiplayer and upcoming singleplayer component. \nHalo Infinite launches for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on December 8.\nWhat platform have you been playing the beta on? What’s your experience been like? Let us know in the comments below!\n[Source: VGC]",

At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. \nThis exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”\nThe Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \nDo you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive or is that simply wishful thinking?

Perhaps an early Christmas present for those that celebrate the holiday, Boba Fett will be added to Fortnite (presumably as a purchasable skin in the Item Shop) on December 24. \nIt’s excellent timing, too, because Disney’s upcoming Disney Plus show about the bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett, launches five days later on December 29. \nBoba Fett will be making his arrival on the Island December 24, 2021 at 7pm ET! #DisneyPlusDay pic.twitter.com/cj9iC6WRBZ\nNovember 12, 2021\nAs you can see in the Tweet above, Boba Fett is pictured on a throne with Fennec Shand, who is played by Ming-Na Wen in The Mandalorian, right beside him. It’s unclear if Fennec Shand will be joining the Fortnite roster, and while it would be cool, the actual words that accompany the image in the tweet suggest that just Boba Fett is joining the game. \nOnly time will tell for now – you only have to wait about six more weeks to find out. While waiting for that, check out the first trailer from The Book of Boba Fett and then read about how Dark Phoenix from X-Men is being added to Fortnite. Read about how something from Naruto Shippuden is coming to Fortnite soon after that. Then, check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and supervillains in Fortnite. \nWill you be picking up Boba Fett in Fortnite next month?

After running down Samus' 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.\nReleased on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo's Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime's influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn't survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro's struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer's own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

No doubt there's been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. \nFortnite\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\nFIFA 21\nNBA 2K21\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla\nDestiny 2\nMLB The Show 21\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\nDemon’s Souls\nNBA 2K22\nIt's great to see Miles Morales and Demon's Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they're day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. \nJim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.\nDespite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it's had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade.

          "description": "Dice has revealed its post-launch plans for the first year of Battlefield 2042 and there’s a lot of content on the way for the multiplayer-only title. \nBattlefield 2042 is out now for those with access to its early access period, and the full title will be out for most on November 19. As you jump into the game, you’ll be treated to a sizeable amount of maps, specialists, weapons, and more, but according to a new blog post from Dice, this is just the beginning. In its first year, you can expect multiple seasons and accompanying battle passes, new specialists, and possibly some new maps. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“In our first year of live service, we will deliver four Seasons, with four Battle Passes, four new Specialists, and new locations along with more fresh content,” Dice’s blog post reads. “We also intend to deliver updates to Battlefield Portal that will give players more ways to build and share new Battlefield experiences with the world.” \nContinuing in the blog, Dice says for Season 1, expect a new Specialist, one Battle Pass, and some additional Portal content. They even tease that players might see some “new sights” (presumably by way of new maps) as the story of 2042 unfolds. More details regarding that will be shared early next year, Dice says. \n“During launch, we’ll also kick off the Preseason with Weekly Missions and Rewards, Limited Time Modes, featured Creator Spotlights and experiences in Battlefield Portal, and more,” the blog post reads. \nWhile waiting for all of this new content to hit 2042, check out Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review in progress and then check out Game Informer’s breakdown of everything we know about Battlefield 2042.
