Movie is just around the corner and while many of us were hoping for a brand new game from Nintendo to coincide with the release, it looks like we're just going to have to settle for a Switch console bundle instead, which was previously rumoured just a couple of weeks ago.\nAs spotted by My Nintendo News, a set of photos has been posted by 'SendMeDVaPics' over on Reddit, who states that they are a Target employee and is currently in the process of shipping the bundles off to retailers. We get a good peek at the console bundle itself, which looks to be a standard Switch console - so no OLED treatment here - with red Joy-Con in place of the usual grey or neon red and blue. Owners will also get a choice of one of three Mario-themed digital titles: New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Super Mario Odyssey.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Moon's haunted.\nThough the JRPG has remained the de facto king of the RPG space for the last few decades, one could argue that the popular genre would never have existed were it not for DRPGs. What started in eons past with titles like Ultima and aimed to translate a traditional D&D gameplay experience to the screen has given way to more approachable dungeon-crawlers like Etrian Odyssey and Demon Gaze. In 2018, Nippon Ichi tried its hand at the subgenre with the enjoyable Labyrinth Of Refrain: Coven Of Dusk and it’s now opted to follow up on that experiment with Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society. Though it’s clearly designed for a relatively narrow audience, there’s a lot to love about Labyrinth of Galleria.\nLabyrinth of Galleria places you in the role of Eureka, a bright-eyed young girl responding to a job posting that sees her visiting a sketchy abandoned manor in the woods. Here, she is welcomed by the witchy Madame Marta, who quickly bonds her with a cute green ghost that Eureka names ‘Fantie’ and prompts her to use her spooky new friend to explore the vast labyrinth below Galleria Manor in search of powerful magical artifacts that the manor’s mysterious owner desires. No human can enter the labyrinth and return unharmed, so Marta teaches her how to use Fantie’s powers to imbue various puppets with life and direct them to explore the dungeon on her behalf. Eureka thus sets out on a vicarious quest into the depths below, while slowly learning more about her eccentric employers.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This leads to another puzzle: Alligator PI Brok urgently exclaims, “I need to get past that door!” Before your grey matter cogs can even get a-whirring, a dialogue box tells you to press 'X' to activate Action Mode. With a good bit of Double Dragon-style – or should we say Double Crocodile-style! – button mashing, the door puzzle is “solved”. So Cowcat Games’ cards go straight onto the table: Brok the InvestiGator is a point-and-click, but sometimes you just punch stuff to smithereens. But does it have an ace up its sleeve?\nBrok is the second game to be developed and self-published by indie shop Cowcat Games. The first was Demetrios, another point-and-click adventure, first released six years earlier in 2016, which arrived on Switch in 2018.

          "description": "It's easy to label Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty as a Soulslike that's basically Nioh and Sekiro mashed together. To some extent, that's true. But I think Wo Long is Team Ninja having sanded off some - not all - of the edges from the overwhelmingly complex Nioh, to craft an action RPG with even crisper combat than its predecessor. And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.\nRead more",

          "description": "At first glance, King Of The Castle might look similar to other medieval political sims; something like Reigns or Yes, Your Grace, where you ascend the throne, rule a kingdom, and make decisions that will impact your gold reserves, military strength, or alliances. That political manoeuvring is intact in King Of The Castle, but this time up to 24 of your friends (or thousands of Twitch viewers) can join your campaign, hopping into the shoes of nobles from various regions. All of them have different goals, all of them can vote on certain decisions, and all of them have the potential to support or backstab the all-powerful monarch: you. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” \r\n\n\r\nLaidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.\nOr, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.\nSons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm still not entirely sure if I'm playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.\nIn practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.\nI am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.\nRead more",

Star Rail's turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin's open-world adventuring, but it's definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There's a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it's shaping up to be a decent time.\nRead more",

This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. \r\n\n\r\nConsternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that \"the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec.\" Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.\nRead more",

Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. \r\n\n\r\nSo, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.\nThe answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.\nRead more",

After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. \r\n\n\r\nBesides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.\nIt’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.\nRead more",

To get today's £499.99 price, use code AGOBEYOND50 at the checkout. \nRead more",

This is an awesome price for one of the fastest SSDs on the market, with the advent of the even faster (but significantly more expensive) 990 Pro pushing the previous flagship to nearly bargain basement territory. \nRead more",

Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.\r\n\n\nHere are the next batch of Game Pass titles:\n\nMerge & Blade (Feb 28th)\nSoul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)\nF1 22 (March 2nd)\nWo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)\n\r\nThis is my first time hearing of Merge & Blade, not to be confused with Mount & Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge & Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Enter the Arenas\nIf you’ve been holding off on diving into Sifu until its new expansion hits the internet waves, then your time is almost here. Sloclap has announced that they’ll be dropping the first DLC, the Arenas Expansion, on March 28, 2023.\nThe Arenas Expansion for Sifu bulks up the core game with an estimated 10 hours of content. This is the sum of 9 new areas, 45 new challenges, and 5 game modes. Among these modes are wave-based survival, time attack, king-of-the-hill style capture, targeted manhunt, and something called “performance mode.” It looks like “performance mode” is about avoiding damage. You can see for yourself in the new trailer.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/n7604ZHgc5M[/embed]\nOriginally released in February 2022, Sifu became something of a beat-’em-up darling. If you haven’t played it before, Sifu is a game about what it’s like to be in your 30s. Time stops mattering, your body seems to age rapidly, and every failure is a new reason to feel obsolete. Mixed with this poignant theme is a tale about martial arts and vengeance.\nPersonally, I bounced off Sifu for basically no reason at all. I really need to circle back to it. I enjoyed what I played, but I think I got distracted by something neat. The Arenas DLC might be a good excuse to do so.\nSifu’s Arenas expansion will be a free upgrade to the base game, and it will release on March 28. It’s currently available on PS4, PS5, and PC. Alongside the DLC, the game will also become available on Steam and Xbox.\nThe post Sifu Arenas expansion gets March 28 release date alongside new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Türkiye-Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle will net you 70 games and books for a minimum payment of $30 USD. Better yet, 100% of the proceeds are going to charity.\nThe Türkiye-Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle is in response to the recent earthquakes that happened in Türkiye and Syria. Thousands of lives have been lost in the disasters, and many more have been displaced. The proceeds from this bundle will be going to Direct Relief, International Medical Corps, and Save the Children to fund their humanitarian aid.\nFor your donation, you’ll be getting a banger selection of games. Among a high-quality slate of indie games like Backbone and Armello, there are some big hits like Ghostrunner, XCOM 2, and Euro Truck Simulator. There’s also the recent release Gotham Knights in there to sweeten the pot.\nAside from games, you’ll also get 10 volumes of Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples’ comic, Saga, and two books from the Starfinder TTRPG.\nThe Humble Bundles have long been a great budget way of grabbing games, but in devastating events like the Türkiye-Syria Earthquake, it’s a good way to draw attention to the cause.

Two QA testers allegedly expressed outrage using \"strong language,\" and disciplinary meetings were set up where both workers were fired.\nThe CWA argues that outbursts and strong language in the \"context of concerted activity\" was protected by the National Labor Relations Board until 2020, where it says the government \"systematically rolled back workers' right, including modifying the standard for determining whether e…",

          "description": "Telltale is shifting to avoid crunch and accommodate an engine shift\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 is being delayed out of this year. Telltale Games confirms that the sequel will be moving into 2024, as the team makes an effort to both avoid crunch and move from Unreal Engine 4 to 5.\nSpeaking to IGN, Telltale Games CEO Jamie Ottilie attributes the choice to a number of reasons. Part of those is concerns over burnout: \"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie said.\n\"Making games is difficult and they need time to be right,\" Ottilie told IGN. \"And it doesn't do any of us any good to ship something that's not ready.\"\nThe other concern is a shift from Unreal Engine 4 to 5. According to the CEO, many on the team feel its worth the extra work, but he does say it entails redoing \"quite a bit of work\" that was already finished.\nRather than crunch or ship an unfinished project, Telltale will work to finish The Wolf Among Us 2 on its new schedule. The new series is episodic, like its predecessor; but unlike the first Wolf Among Us, it's being made all at once, so the whole run will be finished by the time Episode 1 rolls out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkXwW5H28m0\nA wolf in the wings\nWhile that might be disappointing for those hoping for some investigative fantasy stories this year, it sounds like it could be a good thing for the team working on The Wolf Among Us 2. More breathing room and no looming crunch overhead will hopefully make bringing this legend back into the spotlight easier to do.\nThe resurrected Telltale is still rolling out games, though. The Expanse: A Telltale Series is due out this year, in collaboration with Deck Nine Games. And hey, with all that extra time, it's a good excuse to brush up on the first Wolf Among Us if you haven't yet. It's pretty darn good.\nThe post The Wolf Among Us 2 has been pushed out of 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

On February 28 the latest expansion, Lightfall, was released and the player base came out to support in its masses. Not only did Destiny 2: Lightfall see massive numbers and a surge in concurrent players, but it broke its own previous Steam record.\nAs shown on SteamDB, the record for the number of concurrent players on Steam prior to February 28's release of Lightfall was around 292,000. This happened with 2019's release of the Shadowkeep expansion, which was the first major DLC to be released independently by Bungie after acquiring publishing rights for the series from Activision earlier that year. 2022's The Witch Queen came in close, but Lightfall saw a record-breaking 316,750 concurrent Steam players logging in to discover the secrets of the newly discovered city of Neomuna.\nIt's unclear what precisely drew so many Guardians into the game at once with the launch of Lightfall. Is it the new Strand subclass? Perhaps it's the new storyline detailing Calus and his Shadow Legion's invasion of Neomuna in search of the Veil? Maybe it's just hundreds of thousands of people excited to continue with the seasonal storyline, which sees Mara Sov team up with Guardians to face Xivu Arath's impending war. Whatever the reason, the record has been smashed for Destiny 2 by over 10,000 players.\nOur end begins\n[caption id=\"attachment_361843\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bungie[/caption]\nDestiny 2: Lightfall is the penultimate installment in the Light and Dark saga of the game, which will be concluded with 2024's The Final Shape. Bungie recently released a mammoth blog post detailing the year ahead, and it is expected that players will hear more about the future of Destiny within the next 12 months as we draw closer to the next expansion's release.\nThe post Destiny 2’s Lightfall expansion shatters its own concurrent player record on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aoki will serve as president and CEO of Studio Flare, with Mori serving as vice president and head producer. The studio has a long list of openings, with roles for artists, engineers, coders, and server maintenance managers.\n\n\"With knowledge and expertise from their past projects, Studio Flare will deliver new game experiences to global audiences. The company also has received support from NetEase Games, the gaming division of NetEase, Inc.,\" reads a press release. \"Studio Flare has [[the intent] to create games with an edgy feel that bring excitement to hardcore gamers. We will start developing original games for console platforms, with a small but highly talented team based in our studio in Gotanda, Tokyo.\"\nFor those familiar with Mori's work, the specific use of \"edgy\" in the press release is quite amusing, as Mori's oeuvre has frequently featured dark, cringe-cool, super-sexualized characters. While it is fantastic to see Mori back in the game and in the driving seat, one can't help but wonder what fate this leaves for his trademark series, BlazBlue, which stays with Arc System Works, and will hopefully not get lost among that studio's catalog of releases.\nYou can check out Studio Flare's brand-new website — complete with obligatory shades and leather jacket shot — right here.\nThe post BlazBlue producer Toshimichi Mori establishes Studio Flare appeared first on Destructoid.",

A welcome addition to any desktop, Monika's loving gaze will inspire you while you work, watch T.V., make calls, read, cook, eat, dress, and sleep... Especially when you sleep.\nTalk about security! Monika will watch over you, now and always. Forever.\n\nGood Smile Co.'s Pop-Up Parade brand is a range of static, affordable figures, provided without articulation or accessories, but offering a cheaper alternative to the more prestige Figma range. I happen to own a couple of Pop-Up Parade figures myself — such as rice queen Sakuna — and they are nicely sculpted, subtly colored, and make for a fine addition to your work desk and/or windowsill without breaking the bank.\nDoki Doki Literature Club's Monika is available to pre-order now from the Good Smile Co. website and other merch retailers, priced at ¥4,800, (roughly $35 USD), not including any shipping charges.

          "description": "Probe the rich\nPurveyor of (often romantic) visual novels, Winter Wolves, has launched a Kickstarter for their latest concoction, Save the World. They are seeking €4000 for the project, and… oh, they already met it. Good for them.\nSave the World appears to be a yuri visual novel. The Kickstarter doesn’t explicitly say that, but all I see are women, and the two mentioned romantic options are both lesbian. It involves one such woman being abducted by aliens. Their leader, Xen, explains that they aren’t invaders, but rather they travel about saving worlds and asks for the protagonist, Ekiya’s, advice on what’s ailing Earth. Her response is about the unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the aliens follow through by simply eliminating a lot of rich people.\nBoobs and eating the rich. I am captivated.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/jz4oi9nFJVc[/embed]\nI find the narrative crux of Save the World to be quite interesting. It has you consider if, given the opportunity, you would use an alien race's technological force to address the world’s problems. How far would you go? Would it even be worth it? Maybe the world’s problems are humanity’s alone to fix, or perhaps a drastic — possibly violent — course correction is the only way to save it.\nMeanwhile, you also have the option to romance two of the characters. Because there’s no better way to unwind from a moral quandary than with a little grind and bump. Stretch goals include more CG scenes and extra outfits, some of which are sexy or completely explicit (another kind of sexy).\nI’ve enjoyed a fair few of Winter Wolves’ previous visual novels, but with this sort of thing, it mostly comes down to the writer and artist.\nSave the World’s Kickstarter is going on right now and will continue through to March 23, 2023. The development is expected to take one year, with Save the Earth becoming available on PC in March 2024.\nThe post Winter Wolves launches Kickstarter for new visual novel Save the World appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Reopening the Chronicle\nLast year's The DioField Chronicle was an interesting look at the tactics genre, and now in 2023, there's more of it in store. The DioField Chronicle is getting a free update in less than a week, adding more features and content to the Chronicle.\nThe new update for The DioField Chronicle arrives on March 5 at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET. It is free for all owners of The DioField Chronicle, so no need to purchase a separate piece of DLC either.\nhttps://twitter.com/DiofieldGame/status/1630893162976751618\nThis update includes a new story scenario, dubbed \"Waltaquin's Story.\" For those who have already played through the game, you can imagine how venturing into Waltaquin's side might be interesting to see.\nAdditionally, the update is adding a Very Hard difficulty and Extra Mode difficulty, the latter for New Game+ mode. Also, a new weapon type for Magic Tomes is being added as well. Hopefully, that includes some new abilities and skills for users of Tomes.\nYou'll need to reach chapter 6 to access all of this, it seems. Story reasons are one thing, but it will probably also help to be familiar with The DioField Chronicle before tackling some of its newer challenges too.\nA new chapter\nOf the many, many RPGs that Square Enix released last fall, The DioField Chronicle is an odd one. But there's something about its fresh take on strategy and interesting world that's kept it in my mind, months after rolling credits.\nSo yes, I'm happy to see this game getting a free update and some post-launch additions. Waltaquin's side of the story felt like it was left hanging for future potential, and I'm curious to see where it goes, and if any of this hints at a follow-up. I'd certainly like to see The DioField Chronicle carry forward into another entry.\nThe free update for The DioField Chronicle arrives on March 5.\nThe post The DioField Chronicle is getting a free update with new story and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

The big twist here is that all the bells and whistles have been sliced off in favor of more simplistic visuals that bring to mind the type of flowcharts you’d find in your employee training manual or in boardroom presentations. Pushing to further the minimalistic approach, there is no punishment for not getting things exactly right.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/G567j3fp1TE[/embed]\nSome people really love making flowcharts, but there isn’t always a need for them. Masterplan Tycoon sort of feels like a solution to this. It provides abundant need for flowcharts, which should be exceedingly satisfying for the flowchart minded.\nI feel like the minimalistic graphics style has to make it extraordinarily difficult for a small project to stand out, however. Video games are often about piling gloss and hanging ornaments from very simple abstractions. It’s always an interesting experiment to remove those dressings to reveal the naked skeleton beneath. A lot of the most addictive games have stripped the unnecessary fat, and instead replaced it with the constant feeling of progression. Look at, say, Vampire Survivors or basically any game in the clicker sub-genre.\nYou’ll be able to set up your flowcharts in Masterplan Tycoon on March 9 on PC.

The vacancy, which went live yesterday, was spotted by the news outlet GameRant.\nWhile there are no clues as to whether the project is a straight sequel, a remaster, or some form of spin-off, The Coalition is looking for applicants with experience in \"3CS\", (Character, Camera, Controls), which certainly suggests an over-the-shoulder third-person affair. The job listing coincides with recent rumors that the studio had been pushed to can two unannounced games purely to focus on the lucrative and hugely popular shooter franchise.\nhttps://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s=20\nGiant Bomb writer Jeff Grubb has previously suggested that the next title from The Coalition will be Gears 6, which will be the first sequel since the release of Gears 5, which launched on PC and Xbox platforms in the fall of 2019.\n\"This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit,\" said Grubb on the Game Mess Mornings Show. \"The studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but, definitely, that will be their next game.\"\nStill, regardless of whatever title The Coalition has on deck, it is clearly still in its early production stages.

Well, the Verified system is a way for Valve to acknowledge which games are most compatible with its computer handheld, the Steam Deck. While many games can run, not all of them will run well. Some might have some issues with controller support, or new hitches introduced when trying to operate on the Deck.\nVerified acknowledges that a game passes a certain set of standards, as outlined by Valve. This includes controller support, performance, appropriate input icons, and legible text on the in-game interface.\nSo while many Edgerunners might have already been tinkering around with Cyberpunk 2077 on Valve's handheld device, the game is now officially approved for the Steam Deck.\nhttps://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1630599572840906759\nA new cyber deck\nThis guarantee of decent operation makes it a little bit easier for those who don't want to fool around with settings and options to simply play a game on their Steam Deck. It's a pretty good upside for anyone wanting to reacquaint themselves ahead of a possible expansion release this year, too.\nWhile Cyberpunk 2077 got the Steam Deck treatment, though, older games in CD Projekt's back catalog aren't so lucky. This marks the third of CD Projekt's games to become Steam Deck Verified, alongside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. In today's announcement, though,  CD Projekt says there is no plan to provide additional Steam Deck optimizations for \"our legacy titles.\" Sad to say, I think this knocks out any Assassins of Kings hopes.

Available as Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition, this is the first time the title has become available on a platform aside from the Switch and mobile.\nIf the name didn’t give it away, Forklift Extreme is a physics-based forklift simulator. Using “ultra-realistic physics” to bring this favored pastime to life, you can finally live out your dreams as a person who moves things with a vehicle. Or, as the press release puts it, “lifelike driver physics for an immersive experience like never before.” Okay!\n[caption id=\"attachment_366251\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Last Man Gaming[/caption]\nThe Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition includes all the game’s DLC. There’s one where you move furniture and another with giant pumpkins. That’s cool. Pumpkins are cool.\nReal talk, though. The press release email opened with the one-person developer saying they’re just a “big fan of physics simulation games.” You know what? I’m a big fan of programmer-driven games. Reviews of the Switch version aren’t bad but aren’t spectacular, but maybe the package is a lot more enticing with all the DLC included. The critics at least seem to agree that it’s exactly what it says on the box.\nI was driven to write about this because my dad is a yard foreman at a lumberyard in my hometown. A big part of his job is driving a forklift. I wonder if there’s an option in Forklift Extreme for racing wheels, because I’d love to see how he would do in a series of challenges like this.\nForklift Extreme is available on Switch, iOS, and Android.

The animated film is now hitting theaters on April 5 in several markets including the U.S., up from April 7.\nWhile it hits two day earlier in the U.S., other regions will still have to wait a bit longer into April and May; Japan, specifically, will see The Super Mario Bros. Movie debut on April 28.\nhttps://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1630599058564976641\nNothing's been indicated as to why the date shifted. But hey, that's a little bit of Mario slightly earlier than expected.\nWarp pipe to the future\nBefore April arrives, we're due for at least one more blast of information about the upcoming film. Nintendo has confirmed that the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie will air on March 9 in a special movie-focused Direct. The company also says no game information will be included in this Direct, so bad news for anyone hoping for a Mario game to pop up out of the warp pipe.\nAnd honestly, I'm not sure how much more I need to see about the film before I walk into a theater. While I'm still a little iffy on some aspects, I was already in for a viewing when I heard Jack Black's Bowser for the first time. Anything else, all the fun jokes and references, that's just bonus.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters in the U.S. on April 5, 2023.\nThe post The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.\nThe special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nOther big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald's recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.\nAre you interested in grabbing LeBron James PlayStation 5 merch? Let us know in the comments!\nEditors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories.

          "description": "Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.\nTelltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.\nWith such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. \n\"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie tells IGN. \"You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year. \n[Source: IGN]",

It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. \nWith such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. \nHis answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. \nSuzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. \n“Clive.” \nThere you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.",

But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.\n\"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy,\" a press release reads. \"Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games.\" \nAs you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Forspoken review. \nDid you play Forspoken?

          "description": "Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. \nIn a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. \n\"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.\"\nAlthough Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. \nE3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles. \n[Source: IGN]",

Discovery.\nIn a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below. \nHere you go Brusk pic.twitter.com/GYqRd8CZt4\nFebruary 23, 2023\nDeveloper Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. \nSo who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?\nFebruary 23, 2023\nFans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. \nMortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours).

          "description": "Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.\nThe arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.\nLikewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.\nLily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.\nStreet Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.",

If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.\nIt’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.\nWe won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.",

The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.\nBethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: \nMikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.\nIt's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.",

Dead Space is a great case study, as Motive Studios smartly updated Visceral Games’ successful template while preserving its most beloved elements (here’s our review). To learn more about how the remake came together, we had a conversation with Motive Studios’ Roman Campos-Oriola, the creative director of the Dead Space remake, to reflect on the game’s development and success. However, there’s an added twist. \nJoining the discussion is Bret Robbins, creative director of the original Dead Space.

However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.\nIn a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We'll just have to wait and see. \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month.

          "description": "Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.\nEach sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Atomic Heart, Metroid Prime Remastered, WWE 2K23, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, Tchia, Persona 3 Portable, and more.",

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
