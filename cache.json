Nintendo had shown photogenic people playing Switch in the park, on a plane, at rooftop parties, and also in esports. Though Nintendo has generally gone for a relatively low-effort approach to pushing its role in esports, avoiding a great deal of the pesky work and monetary investments, it has been slowly trying to do more. In the grand vision of late 2016 it was Splatoon 2 that would play out in a packed arena of excited fans, as Nintendo evidently envisioned big things for the franchise.\nThat didn't happen, for a broad combination of reasons, but the game was a success. It was certainly meatier than its experimental Wii U original, offering more content and options for solo or co-op play. The competitive multiplayer, of course, became the long-term focus for many, and you can still find players battling it out online with terrifying rankings.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Diablo has, for good reasons, become a shorthand for describing the flavour of gothic, grimdark fantasy setting in games, where pus-filled demonic hordes and rotting, undead corpses scour a hellish cathedral looking for unwitting adventurers. For all its wretched decay, however, the series still feels like an indulgence to be savoured. Its clickiness and abhorrent sights make the games endlessly gratifying, and masterful butchery of fiends eases most players into a comfortable rhythm. And part of that appeal lies in the macabre yet captivating fantasy it so deftly peddles — all that blood, gore and guts really make for a grisly setting that’s nearly impossible to look away from.\r\n\n\nTainted Grail: Conquest conveys the same sense of blight and doom in its dark fantasy universe — one that’s a reimagining of Arthurian legends — but also ups the ante with a huge wallop of Slay The Spire’s roguelike, deck-building elements.\nRead more",

First and least of these was Desert World, a blithe eternity of golden sand always viewed from kilometres up, where fizzing white rings rose toward me like expanding surf. I'd try to find my way down to the surface, but always at the risk of glitching straight through and ending up in Snake World, where monstrous serpents emerged from darkened kitchens.\r\n\n\r\nSomewhere between these two poles lay the realm of the Animals, not that they were really animals, but clouds of eyelash-thin mandible, grot and sparkle, like rotten food on the point of becoming a school of tropical fish. I loved Animal World. I used to spend hours trying to mind-hack my way into it. I was pretty shocked to find its likeness in Sluggish Morss: Pattern Circus - an irresistibly strange, gristly, sorrowful, comical and inventive album of creatures, songs, places and phrases from Jack King-Spooner and composer Helena Celle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Which is a shame, since it’s a rather unique title in their respective careers, and it charts new waters for these cult directors.\r\n\n\nWorld’s End Club was the first game the pair released since forming their own studio, Too Kyo Games, and can best be described as a bizarre but intriguing blend of platforming and death games, starring a cast of prepubescent children way too young to be fixing the world or dealing with cults. Think Danganronpa, if Danganronpa was a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a murder game filled with psychopaths.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The latest free game giveaway in GOG's winter sale is an unexpected one for the festive season, but perhaps a game which captures the feeling of being trapped at a seemingly endless Christmas lunch with awful relatives: I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. Nothing says 'bad family Christmas' like being tortured for 109 years by a sentient supercomputer which nuked humanity and keeps only five people alive to torment. The 90s point 'n' click adventure game is a grim one (so grim!), but one which does have its fans.\nRead more",

It is a very big cave, and every night a huge colony of bats come screaming out of the entrance. They spend the day clinging to the ceiling of this big cave, and all their bat poo falls down and has become a towering heap carpeting the floor.\nBut then David said look, the carpet is moving. And it turns out that the whole bottom of the cave is covered in cockroaches and giant centipedes. And if ever a small baby bat or an old injured bat falls, it is eaten alive by this hoard of chittering insects. This nature documentary haunted me, for it was the worst thing I could imagine happening.\nAnyway, Nate has been to that cave and he's going to tell us all about it for this episode of our supporters only podcast, The Nate Files.

Ever a broad church, 2021's seen enough releases to keep ten of me busy, from the easy-going Legion War to the month-consuming Shadow Empire. I don't know about you, but my personal \"to play\" list is out of control.\nAnd yet, while we've had plenty to enjoy this year, it's felt like a period of build-up to something bigger. I'm not one for looking forward. If a game's not out yet it tends to disappear from my mind, making room for a hundred other recent releases in this age of plenty. That I've less interest in looking back over this year than I do pondering the next suggests that maybe we're in for something special in the coming twelve months. Or perhaps it's just been a rough one and I'm very sleep deprived and don't want to think about 2021. Either way, let's have a look at what's in store for strategy fans in 2022, yeah?\nRead more",

He’s the kind of archetypal director whose work I’ve been exposed to in bits and pieces without ever actually sitting down to watch one of his films in full. All of that is to say that, upon starting Alfred Hitchcock - Vertigo the game, I was in no position to judge whether it was a faithful adaptation of the film or to recognize all but the most obvious illusions to Hitchcock’s body of work (look, birds!). That’s okay, though, because as it turns out, Vertigo is an original story based on a collage of Hitchcockian concepts, not a direct adaption of the 1958 film by the same name.\nVertigo the game follows author Ed Miller as he grapples with a debilitating case of vertigo–a condition that leaves him unable to stand as the world appears to spin around him–and paralyzing guilt over the death of his daughter and her mother, Faye, after their car falls off a bridge into a ravine below. With Ed bed ridden, it’s up to Dr. Julia Lomas, psychologist and psychiatrist, and Sheriff Nick Reyes to unravel the mystery of what really happened, and whether Faye and his daughter even exist. My thoughts on how Vertigo goes about telling this story are... complicated. \nRead more",

Games that were delayed by the pandemic last year finally got their due in 2021, but in turn many of the releases we were expecting this year have inevitably slipped into 2022. The pandemic has affected games of all sizes this year, and I don't think it will go down in the history books as one of our all-time greats. There were still plenty of fantastic games that came out this year, mind, and we're still counting down our absolute favourites over in our Advent Calendar. \nThat said, I do think 2021 will prove to be a pivotal year for RPS - and not just because I stole Graham's key card and changed the locks on the front door of the Treehouse.

Modders have been hard at work weaving nice dresses with their virtual looms at a rate of knots. Oh, and they’ve morphed characters into Buster Swords and produced some other equally useful things too. Let's have a gander at some of their most interesting creations.\nRead more",

The dino-battling FPS Second Extinction is the new freebie. \nOriginal Story: This year had us stuck in many video game time loops, but one of my absolute favourites was Loop Hero. I never thought an autobattler RPG would hook me the way it did, but I spent hours upon hours helping a little knight circle a seemingly endless void, and had a wonderful time doing it. If you didn't have a chance to play it earlier this year, it's now free on the Epic Game Store until tomorrow. I heartily encourage you to pick this one up, it's one of our favourite games of 2021. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this year, Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment announced they were porting the old 2001 hack and slash Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance to PC and consoles. It came out on PlayStation back in summer, alas they didn't give a date for PC. But, surprise! It's today! PC folks can finally try out the Baldur's Gate that console users first experienced 20 years ago. I did a full playthrough this summer and had a lovely time, at the expense of my partner, who I made sit through one of the jankiest couch co-op games in existence.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But we (I) gather ourselves and chat FPS news, like how PUBG is going free to play, Overwatch actually has something new, and lots of Halo Infinite stuff. We also get one final update on Imogen's Apex Legends rank. I'd love to say it's positive, but it's actually quite crushing. Merry Christmas.\nRead more",

This news comes two months after the studio put out its most successful title yet in Forza Horizon 5, which at the time of its release, also had the biggest launch of any Xbox Game Studios game ever. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“After 12 years working on five award-winning Forza Horizon games, Gavin Raeburn is leaving Playground Games as studio director,” Turn 10 Studio Head and Forza franchise lead Alan Hartman told Windows Central. “A founding member of Playground Games, we thank Gav for his leadership and contributions to the Forza franchise and wish him all the best.” \nHartman said another Playground co-founder, Trevor Williams, will transition from General Manager to Studio Head effective immediately, replacing Raeburn. He also said the studio will continue to focus on updates to Forza Horizon 5 and the ongoing development of its Fable reboot, which was officially announced in 2020. \nAs noted by Windows Central, Raeburn has quite the history in the racing genre, having worked on Codemasters’ TOCA series, Dirt, and Grid. He left Codemasters in 2009 to create Playground Games, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. \nThere’s no word on what’s next for Raeburn or if he’s even staying in games. \nFor more about Forza Horizon 5, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Forza Horizon 5 review, and then read about why it’s on Game Informer’s Top 10 Xbox Series X games list.

          "description": "Riot Games have pulled the curtains back on the newest agent joining Valorant and her name is Neon. \nRevealed by way of a special agent trailer, Neon is a fast-paced electric shooter that seemingly specializes in zooming all over a given map quicker than any other agent in the game. The short story trailer, which runs less than three minutes, reveals that Neon is a Manila, Philippines-based agent with an excellent taste in music. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, Neon is a fan of Entertain Me by Ylona Garcia and 88rising. She’s also seemingly a fan of dreaming about what players are going to accomplish on the battlefield using her powers. We see her sprinting and sliding all over the maps shown in the trailer, using her electricity to make it easier. However, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be able to shoot while sprinting so don’t expect to be the run-n-gunner Neon might appear to be. \nWe also get a quick look at one of her abilities where Neon lifts two large and long walls of electricity in a straight line, walls that she’s free to run in and out of. \nThe trailer also reveals that Neon will arrive in Valorant with Episode 4: Disruption, although a release date for this new episode (which is what Valorant calls its big updates) has not yet been revealed. However, the current battle pass ends on January 11 so some fans have speculated that Episode 4 will begin the following day on January 12. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out our thoughts on the shooter in Game Informer’s Valorant review and then read about how Valorant’s director is no longer working on the game and instead working on a new secret project at Riot.

However, if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber or a member of Microsoft’s PC Game Pass, the game will hit those services on day one, meaning you can download them for free. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHopefully, you’ve got a friend lined up to play Nobody Saves The World with, too, because the game features online co-op, although it does not feature cross-play so you’ll need to be on the same platform as your friend to play together. \nIn Nobody Saves The World, you control a “featureless nobody” that can transform into a variety of different animals and creatures, including a slug, a ghost, a dragon, a rat, a robot, and much more. You’ll need to swap between over 15 different forms with mixed and matched abilities to unlock and complete quests to progress through the game’s narrative. \nSpeaking of abilities, Drinkbox says there are over 80 different Form abilities, meaning each player will likely have their own customized build that works best for them. You might play as an egg that leaves a trail of slime behind you or a rat that shoots fireballs – the choice is up to you. \nIf you’re interested in the soundtrack, which was created by composer Jim Guthrie (Below, Sword and Sorcery), it will be available for purchase on Steam and other platforms when the game is released on January 18. \nNobody Saves The World was announced back in March and it quickly gained traction as yet another exciting title from Drinkbox.

Of course, “shipped” is very different than “sold,” as this new statistic doesn’t necessarily indicate 4 million people have purchased the game, but manufacturers aren’t going to ship a game to storefronts when said storefronts have plenty in stock. \n『#ゼルダ無双 厄災の黙示録』の全世界累計出荷本数が400万本を突破しました。プレイしていただいた皆さま、誠にありがとうございます。\nhttps://t.co/VV14JMDMeV#ゼルダの伝説 #Zelda\nJanuary 5, 2022\nSo while Age of Calamity hasn’t sold 4 million units, it has likely sold millions, which must be exciting for Omega Force. The team had to pull off quite the feat to make it a success, as creating a prequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of all time, is no easy task. Omega Force even went a step further and created an expansion pass for Age of Calamity that furthered the prequel story by adding in controllable guardians, new weapons, and a rideable motorcycle to use in-game. These expansions also brought a new “Apocalyptic” difficulty to the musou as well as new challenges in the Royal Ancient Lab, new enemies, and more. \nFor more about Age of Calamity, read this feature on why Omega Force made this musou a prequel in the first place, and then check out our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review. \nHave you played Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity?

So, it's only natural that Sucker Punch's visually stunning action/adventure game would find the same success as the samurai flicks that inspired it. Ghost of Tsushima is as popular as ever, with 8 million copies sold. \nWe're thrilled and amazed that #GhostOfTsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies!\npic.twitter.com/AQfyqviBlK\nJanuary 5, 2022\nA recent tweet (seen above) revealed the game's newest milestone: \"We're thrilled and amazed that Ghost of Tsushima has officially sold more than 8 million copies! Thank you so much to everyone who has played since launch! We are so incredibly appreciative and grateful for the support!\" \nIt's no surprise that Ghost of Tsushima had such a sizable player base. Cutting-edge graphics (somehow made more impressive with the PlayStation 5's Director's Cut), fluid combat mechanics with flashy animations, and a story/game world inundated in Japanese culture and samurai lore help set Ghost of Tsushima apart from its contemporaries. Game Informer's Matt Miller loved the vanilla game, awarding it a 9.5. In his impression piece on the Director's Cut, he echoed the same shining sentiments from his original review while speaking to the added content:\n\"I was happily surprised by the breadth, depth, and challenge of the Iki Island expansion. For new players, it will extend an already lengthy adventure into something more. Meanwhile, returning players should be thrilled at how well this experience dovetails out of an already stellar game. Iki Island is what I want out of single-player game expansions. And it's further proof (as if we needed any more at this point) that Sucker Punch has a standout new property to continue building on.\"\nI've been playing through the Director's Cut myself and am completely enamored with Ghost of Tsushima's art direction and overall vibe.

Investigating the scene reveals a large driller protected by IO guards at a landmark called Mole Team: Omega. That's right, the Imagined Order (better known as IO) is back and it appears they drilled through the island.\nOdds are we'll see more IO troops on the island in the days and weeks ahead, likely culminating in a new story development. There's a chance it could tie into The Foundation unlockables countdown, which currently sits at 30 days.\nIf you want to check out the drilling site, make sure you bring a weapon, as IO will open fire the second they see you. Look for a tent and you'll find a large weapon cache. A launcher awaits on the far side of the dirt pile, so you should be able to make a quick getaway after getting the rare loot.\nI can't wait to see where Epic goes with this next. We're still waiting for tornadoes and that strange six-legged purple monster to show up, but the arrival of IO is a nice surprise that should lead to a new antagonist showing up soon.",

My days at work were mostly spent alone in a dark projection booth above a corporate auditorium. To spice up my evenings and force some human interaction on myself, I started playing Magic: The Gathering at a local game shop. I spent multiple days a week there, learning how to draft, build decks, and catch onto the lingo and language of the game. Slowly, I incorporated myself into the small group of regulars, and day by day, I felt less alone.\nWhile shuffling decks and slinging spells against these new acquaintances, I noticed shared mannerisms and social archetypes people took on within my little corner of the Magic community. Let me tell you how pleasantly surprised …",

Whenever I talk to anyone about the latest middling entry in Madden NFL or NBA 2K, the first question I always receive is, \"Should I buy this one if I already own last year's?\" I used to have to think more about whether I'd recommend a sports gamer pick up the latest iteration, but over the last several years, the games have felt just that way: iterative. Now, my answer is always, \"How important is [this year's tentpole feature] to you? How important is having the latest rosters?\" If even one of those is wishy-washy, my answer is either \"Wait for a sale\" or \"Just play last year's game.\" This song and dance has only become more noticeable as the years have continued.\nMy f…",

Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has done a nice job of offering up colorful items for players to purchase. The latest rotation doesn't have much other than one cool item that ties into the return of the Fracture: Tenrai event.\nThe expensive item of the week is a 2,000 credit ($17.99) legendary mythic effect set called Enlightened Path, which adds pink rose petals to your Spartan's footsteps, slides, and spawns. Also included in this bundle is a white mask called Grand Play that can be applied to your nameplate, armor, vehicles, and weapons. I have to point out that the price for this bundle is ridiculous, especially since the player usually gets an armor set at this rate.\nThe more interesting offering this week is the Meditative State bundle, with the standout piece being the Imperial Crest helmet attachment for the Yoroi armor core earned in the Fracture: Tenrai event. This set also offers a cool coloring option called Expressive Soul which adds samurai-like highlights to the armor in gold and green. The bundle is rounded out with a triumphant stance called Mirror Tale, and an epic charm called Black Opal. This pack is 1,000 credits.\nIf you want to focus on your weapons and pick up another high-priced bundle, the Blacksteel Katana set is rather striking, adding a dragon scale effect to the MA40 assault rifle. You also get Black Cat weapon coloring, a Tiger Energy charm, and a Sun and Shadow icon to apply to weapons, vehicles, and more.\nThe item of the day is the Desert Sun bundle, offering the Ryuu visor for the Yoroi armor, and a dull green armor coating called Forgotten Sands.\nAll told, this week's offerings rank among the game's worst to date. The good news, though, is Fracture: Tenrai is back and we can keep working on that battle pass.",

According to Gematsu, Matsuyama said during the livestream that the team will announce a new game in February, with a planned release for it in the Summer. The CEO also said that the new title will definitely get people talking, and that it’s a game that “promises to be something that will shake the world,” Gematsu writes. \nPerhaps it’s a new game based on a very popular anime, or maybe the studio is returning to the .hack series it was first made famous for. Speaking of the .hack series, Matsuyama said the company is preparing for the 20th anniversary of it in June. \nWhile waiting to see what CyberConnect2 announces next month, check out Game Informer’s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review, and then read this feature breaking down everything you need to know about Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nAre you excited to see what CyberConnect2 might reveal in February?

More specifically, the DualSense touchpad can be used to control the Terrain Scanner in-game. Plus, the controller's built-in speaker can be used by characters to tell you orders as if said characters are actually using a radio to communicate with you, as one might do when mining deep into an alien planet's terrain. \nFor more about the game, check out Game Informer's Deep Rock Galactic review. \nThe original story…",

          "description": "It’s no surprise that Spider-Man No Way Home – the third film in Sony’s Tom Holland-led franchise – has reached impressive critical and financial heights. Fans have been waiting for a live-action Multiverse movie since Into the Spiderverse, and No Way Home continues to serve as the perfect answer to that enthusiasm. The movie garnered positive feedback from viewers and handily surpassed the box office numbers of every 2021 film. As of right now, No Way Home is Sony’s most successful movie of all time. And, according to Hollywood Reporter, it’s the first pandemic-era film to amass more than $1 billion at the box office. \nDeadline reported in December 2021 that No Way Home could ultimately come away with a $610 million net profit, which would boast higher numbers than Homecoming and Far From Home. This estimate might not be far-fetched because, on Christmas Eve, the latest web-slinger movie became Sony’s top-grossing domestic title ever. And as long as theaters stay open (who knows what the future may hold now that the omicron strain is spreading like wildfire), No Way Home will undoubtedly continue its staggering financial success this year. \nIn his most daring adventure yet, Peter Parker and Doctor Strange accidentally tear open Multiverse doorways, bringing franchise-favorite villains like Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and Electro into the fray. This might be the most ambitious Spider-Man movie, but it won’t be the last time we see Tom Holland in the skin-tight suit, as the British star may appear in three more films. \nIn Spider-Man games news, No Way Home-inspired skins are available in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, while Spider-Man and MJ cosmetics have launched in Fortnite. And if you want more MCU info, check out the new trailer for Doctor Strange’s In The Multiverse of Madness movie. \n[Source: Deadline, Hollywood Reporter]",

It allows companies the chance to thank fans for their support over the last year, tease upcoming projects, and share success stories of recently released titles. In Atlus’ case, its message reveals that the recently released Shin Megami Tensei V has performed very well during its short lifespan while planting seeds for its next title.\nSo far, over 800,000 copies of Shin Megami Tensei V have been sold. Atlus states this is a cumulative sales number, implying digital sales are accounted for. This makes SMT V the best-selling entry in the long-running series despite only launching less than two months ago, shattering Shin Megami Tensei IV’s lifetime sales of 600,000+. \nThe publisher has an eventful 2022 ahead, namely, celebrating Persona’s 25th anniversary. We already know that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax comes to modern platforms in March, but Atlus teases other surprises are in store. Lastly, Atlus states it has an unannounced project is in the works. \nCouple this news with the upcoming Switch port of the well-received 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, and Atlus is sitting pretty heading into the new year. Shin Megami Tensei V's success is great to hear, though not entirely surprising. After all, it was one of our runner-ups for The Best RPG of 2021, which you can read all about here. \n[Source: Famitsu]",

This week, we unpack Bungie's epic conclusion to Master Chief's original trilogy of adventures: Halo 3.\nReleased with all the hype in the world on September 25, 2007, Halo 3 served as both the pinnacle of the series as well as its supposed swan song for Master Chief. Using the now iconic tagline \"finish the fight,\" Bungie created Halo 3 under the agreement that it would part ways with Microsoft after a new set of Halo games. The third game was the first of this batch, and its creation suffered from internal studio conflicts, including creative heads walking out mid-development. How did Bungie cope with matching Halo 2's quality, migrating to a new platform in the Xbox 360, and delivering a conclusion that lived up to expectations? Tune in to find out. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer video editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and impact of Master Chief's grand sequel.

Gone are the overly complicated plot points, invasive loot box rewards, and ability kit-focused metas. 343 Industries’ latest installment is a lesson on finding balance in simple storytelling and leveling the competitive playing field. It’s also a revolutionary step that’ll undoubtedly inform the next generation of Halo projects. Read more...",

          "description": "This year was a great one for Koei Tecmo, which was behind several releases by way of either development or publishing, but the studio is teeing up 2022 to be even better. \nFirst reported and translated by Twinfinite, Japanese website 4Gamer published an article about 2022 plans for local game developers, including Koei Tecmo. In it, Koei Tecmo’s entertainment division general manager, Yosuki Hayashi, says the studio will reveal several games that have been in the works for years in 2022, stating that these titles “will pave the way for the future of the company,” Twinfinite writes. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHayashi says the “full power of the current Koei Tecmo” will be shown in 2022 and that the year will mark the release of several games developed by the studio. As for what, Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda said fans can look forward to future titles such as an action game set in the Three Kingdom era and another game that he’s actually directing. \nFinally, Fatal Frame producer Yosuke Kikuchi said that in 2022, “his team will challenge the development of something that they have never done before,” according to Twinfinite’s translation and that while it will be a long time before it’s formally announced, the studio is excited to get started. \nPerhaps 2022 will bring a new Nioh game to consoles and PC, or maybe even a new Fatal Frame, especially since the last one was released in 2015. Check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water review and then read Game Informer’s Nioh 2 review after that. \n[Source: Twinfinite]\nAre you excited about Koei Tecmo’s 2022?

          "description": "As a fan of the film Battle Royale and The Hunger Games books (the movies are fine too), I’m surprised the battle royale genre hasn’t permanently sunk its teeth into me. Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed my time with Fortnite and Apex Legends, the two titles I’ve dabbled with the most. They’re well-crafted games. But each of them also occupies the same niche being shooters. I’m itching for more creative spins on the formula. \nThe recently announced Rumbleverse, a pro wrestling flavored take on the genre, tickles my fancy as a long-time fan of sports entertainment. But I’m selfish, so give me more battle royales based on my specific interests. If you’ve listened to me on podcasts or watched me on streams, you probably know I’m a big Yu-Gi-Oh fan as well. Since its inception, it’s been my tra…",
