The new Switch port (and starboard) starts out as a tranquil few days out on the water, but with bugs and some frustrating gameplay it becomes quite a stormy journey.\nThe game begins with your partner being declared deceased after they went missing three years ago (you can choose pronouns and appearances for both). Your adult daughter, River, moves in to care for you and help you, alongside your cute dog, Waffles, who you can pat and take for walks. You open a present left for you: a fishing journal.

It's visited magical, mystical storybook worlds in Odin Sphere. It's returned to a medieval, warfaring world many times with Grand Knights History and Unicorn Overlord. It's been to 1980s Japan in 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. We've even been able to go to witch school thanks to GrimGrimoire.

          "description": "Bloomin' lovely.\nWhen cosy and wholesome games first stepped onto the scene, they were counter-culture — created in response and in resistance to an industry that churned out violence, conflict, and a particular type of masculinity that wasn't keen on things like emotions or intimacy. Some people were tired of this monolithic and exclusionary idea of what a game 'should' be — and so, as a direct contrast to all of that, the cosy game movement was created, prioritising stories that minimised conflict, and focused instead on growth and creation. That's part of the reason why so many cosy games are about farming and relationships, because the themes of cultivation and creation are almost the exact opposite of violence and conflict.\nBut these days, cosy games have become a dominant part of gaming culture, and the conflict-free alternatives they once offered as a respite from the status quo are now a lucrative part of the status quo. This is what happens when counter-culture becomes culture: it forgets its roots and its purpose, and instead becomes about aping what's already popular. In the process, many cosy games fail to understand that a player's desire for softness and kindness does not mean that they want a completely toothless game. Challenge is not conflict. Challenge is fun.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Sumo Newcastle's Deathsprint 66, an 8-player on-foot racing game based on Stephen King's dystopian novel The Running Man, players build a Hype multiplier by combo-ing stunts such as railgrinds, and also, murdering each other. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I do not have telekinetic powers that allow me to control the path of a bullet from a sniper rifle, and I was not part of a murderous cult that killed my father-figure. But if I did and I were, you can bet that I'd go on a rip-roaring rampage of revenge! Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level. It's a satisfying Sniper Elite meets Superhot puzzle of ultraviolence, and it's neat.\nRead more",

Having beat them myself, I didn't find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it's very janky in the most adorable way.

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

If you do buy just one to start off with - say, to get a feel for the quality of Thrones of Decay as a package - you’ll get a 15% discount on the remaining two packs in the future.\n \nRead more",

You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.\nOriginal story\nRoblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens.

In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.\n Read more",

It's a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of \"cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation\" and \"cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views\".

ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In Keepsake's co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.\nIt's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Many Pokémon Go events boost the chances of obtaining Shiny creatures to help trainers complete their collection. One, in particular, is the Shiny Croagunk, a Poison and Fighting Type that doesn't appear too often. We're here to get you one step closer to this Pokémon by giving you the latest details on its whereabouts. \n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go\n\n\nThe Shiny Croagunk can be captured during its Spotlight Hour, set for April 9 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. local time. Croagunks appear more frequently throughout this short duration, giving you some time to capture a lot of them. The event starts just after Sizeable Surprises and provides double Evolution XP for the creature.\n\n\nIf you aren't successful with its capture during the Spotlight Hour, try the following methods to get a Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go:\n\n\n\nComplete Field Research tasks\n\n\nFight in Raids\n\n\nUse Lure Modules or Incense\n\n\nHatch eggs\n\n\nUse Cloudy Weather Boost\n\n\nCapture during special events\n\n\n\nWhile the Spotlight Hour is probably the best route for the Shiny Croagunk, it's still possible to find it outside of the duration. Croagunks tend to spawn during cloudy weather, so look out for these boosts to better your chances. Occasionally, the Pokémon appears for battles, but it all depends on the current Raid schedule. \n\n\nOther events, like Season of Go and Fashion Week, have included a Shiny Croagunk in their lineup. These celebrations typically last longer, providing trainers much more time than the limited Spotlight Hour. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Shiny rates for Croagunk are fairly low, with a one-in-500 chance. Again, if you want to increase your chances, your best bet is the Spotlight Hour or a possible Pokémon Go Community Day event. Once Croagunk Spotlight Hour is up, more critters, such as Trubbish, Clefairy, and Weedle, will take over the spot shortly after. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Renetti currently dominates Warzone's short-range meta in Season 3, but Raven Software plans to end that brief reign of terror. \n\n\nOn April 9, Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 received minor updates, addressing a few bugs and weapon balancing issues. In Warzone, the devs made minor tweaks to the FJX Horus, MORS, and TAQ Evolvere, but community members expected a Renetti nerf as well. Raven Software heard the pushback and responded, \"We are working on adjustments to the Renetti which will be released in the near future.\"\n\n\nA nerf for the Renetti was long overdue. Image via Activision\n\n\nAs part of the Season 3 update, the RAM-9 had its damage and sprint-to-fire values nerfed, leading to players annointing the HRM-9 as the new king of Warzone's short-range meta. However, that assumption proved to be false, as the Renetti pistol with the JAK Ferocity Carbine Conversion Kit equipped currently leads all SMGs with a 490 millisecond time-to-kill speed. On average, it should only take around 8.5 bullets to down an enemy. In comparison, the HRM-9 has a time-to-kill speed of 612 milliseconds and can only down opponents in around 10.5 bullets.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Rennetti had a leg up on the HRM-9 because players will be able to use the pistol in underwater combat, but that's not possible with the SMG. Sidearms usually don't have better stats than primary weapons, so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Raven Software plans on making adjustments. \n\n\nIt also doesn't help that the community has picked up on just how strong the Renneti is, either. According to WZ Ranked, the pistol has a 19 percent pick rate, which ranks second in popularity rankings by a wide margin. Only time will tell, if the upcoming nerf is enough to put the beast down for good, but it's clear that a change was long-overdue.  \n\nThe post Warzone devs confirm nerf for overpowered Renetti appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mantine offers many advantages on the battlefield due to its dynamic type as a Water and Flying Type. To make things even better, trainers can get a Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go to increase its rarity. This feat is no easy task, but we're here to help you narrow down the search. \n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go\n\n\nYou can get a Shiny Mantine out in the wilds during the Sizeable Surprises Pokémon Go event. Mantines appear more frequently, so you can continuously catch them to increase your chances. Unlike the Shiny Wimpod and Shiny Kartana, this Pokémon is not associated with any Raid or Field Research tasks, meaning it all relies on luck. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUse Lure Modules and Incense to attract more Pokémon near you, which may result in the Shiny Mantine's appearance. Thanks to the critter's type, it also helps if you have a Rainy or Windy Weather Boost. \n\n\nOther than catching a Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go, it is possible to evolve a Shiny Mantyke for it. Give the creature 50 Mantyke Candies to evolve it to a Shiny Mantine. This technique still requires a bit of luck, but it is an option, nonetheless. \n\n\nI suggest catching as many Mantyke and Mantines as possible before the Sizeable Surprises event concludes on April 9 at 8 p.m. local time. Other Shiny variants, such as Diglett, Wailmer, Joltik, and Cutiefly, are also available during this time. If you happen to miss the event, more Pokémon are expected to come for the upcoming Bug Out event on April 12 at 10 a.m. local time. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Mantine in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

In multiplayer, the devs plan to introduce six 6v6 maps throughout the season, with various sizes and locations. Additionally, four new weapons enter the fray, including the MORS and BAL-27, first introduced in 2014 for CoD: Advanced Warfare.

Weapon names appearing in the game files don’t guarantee they will be added to the title, as plans could always change. But Bob has a proven track record of these data mines being accurate. Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that Verdansk will return to Warzone with the release of Treyarch's mainline release, tentatively dubbed Black Ops Gulf War in 2024. \n\n\nBut there are community members that are still holding out hope that the beloved map will return in Season 4 instead.

          "description": "The CoD devs launched an investigation into an issue preventing players from landing their shots with the MORS sniper rifle in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. \n\n\nOn April 8, the CoD support staff confirmed, \"Our team is aware of an issue causing a slight optic misalignment with the MORS Sniper Rifle, which may cause shots that appear on-target to miss.\" As for when community members can expect a fix, the developers scheduled the fix for a future game update but did not provide a specific date. This isn't the first time the player base has dealt with aiming issues. In the season three update, the devs rolled out an update to remove the randomness as ADS Idle Sway, because there were instances where a player would aim down sights, but the crosshair wouldn't be aligned with the center of the screen. It's unclear if that's the same issue this time around with the MORS. \n\n\nThe MORS sniper rifle is set to take over MW3 and Warzone. Image via Activision\n\n\n Since its introduction in season three, some community members have already crowned the MORS as the best sniper rifle in Warzone. The MORS has a faster aim-down sight speed than the KATT-AMR and XRK Stalker, better bullet velocity, faster fire rate, movement speed, weapon swap speed, and reload time. Additionally, the new sniper rifle is able to one-shot kill an enemy from any range with the Anti-Material Slugs equipped. An added benefit of the quick rifle is that there is no need to reload, as the sniper automatically rechambers after each shot. \n\n\nWhen the optic misalignment issue gets sorted out, we fully expect the MORS to be one of Warzone's best, if not the most used weapon. According to WZ Ranked, season three's latest weapon is already the seventh most popular gun in the battle royale, and that usage rate will only improve when players no longer have to worry about missing their shots. \n\nThe post It’s not just you missing shots with the MORS sniper rifle in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Although the Ultra Beasts are already powerful in their original forms, their Shiny versions prove most rewarding through their high rarity. So, if you want to know how to catch a Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go, here's what you need to do. \n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go\n\n\nTrainers can get a Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go by participating in 5 Star Raids. While the Sizeable Surprises event is active, this creature appears during these battles, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere. If you're not in this area, use a Remote Raid Pass to access it. The Shiny Celesteela is also available in the Southern Hemisphere for those who want more Ultra Beast variants. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\n5 Star Raids aren't the easiest fights to achieve, so prepare beforehand with a powerful team. Kartana has a weakness against Fire Types, including the following Pokémon:\n\n\n\nReshiram\n\n\nMega Charizard\n\n\nHeatran\n\n\nIncineroar\n\n\nArcanine\n\n\nMoltres\n\n\nBlaziken\n\n\n\nTo get the Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go, you may need to complete several 5 Star Raids. Similar to the Shiny Wimpod, it's not always guaranteed, but some trainers have gotten lucky enough to obtain it in the first Raid. After winning the battle, the Shiny Kartana can appear for the Bonus Challenge. Use a fruit like Silver Pinap Berry or Golden Razz Berries to easily get it on your side. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the event for the Shiny Kartana will come to a close shortly. It will end on April 9 at 8 p.m. local time, so make sure to get through as many 5 Star Raids as possible. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Kartana in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ahead of the BAFTA Awards on Thursday, at which Dredge is nominated for four awards, developer Black Salt Games has announced a collaboration with production company Story Kitchen to adapt the critically acclaimed title into a live-action feature film.\nIn the game, players explore a mysterious archipelago as a fishing boat captain.

However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11.

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta.\" You can learn more here.",

He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays.

Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
