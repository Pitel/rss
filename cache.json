          "description": "For the imperium!\nFun fact: origins of the term ‘grimdark’ can be directly traced back to the original Warhammer 40k tabletop game. Suffice it to say, the cynical and nihilistic world of Warhammer 40k sucks. Despite the highly advanced and amazing intergalactic society that mankind has built, to live in this universe is to live in a bleak place where humanity exists in a state of total war as it fights hopelessly to delay its inevitable demise at the hands of all manner of eldritch space gods and aliens. Nobody is ‘good’ in this universe, and nobody is going to make it out okay, which makes Warhammer 40k and the boomer shooter genre feel like a match made in hell. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun may not be the best entry in this genre, but it gets enough right that we’d recommend it to anyone looking for a solid retro FPS.\nBoltgun is set after the events of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. You're a marine sent by the imperium to pacify a group of tech priests who are experimenting with a dangerous power source on a distant planet. You’re initially sent with a squad, but your drop pod rather conveniently crashes and burns on the planet’s surface, violently killing everyone except you. Left with no other choice and armed with nothing more than a sick chainsaw sword, you press on into the den of heretics to carry out the mission in the name of the glorious Emperor.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It is largely agreed amongst critics and fans alike that the original should have been a pack-in title to showcase the features of the then-new Joy-Con and the local multiplayer focus of the console rather than a full-price purchase.

          "description": "I'm unsure whether to call Raid On Taihoku a \"historical game\", since it's an adventure game with enough daftness to feel a bit unlike what that phrase brings to mind. But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.\nTaxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.\nRead more",

He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.\r\n\n\r\nWithout their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.\nEpisodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?\nI initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.\" Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.\n Read more",

          "description": "Despite a name evoking the opulent leaders of one of history's most famous (and, as I’d soon learn, famously misunderstood) civilisations, Total War: Pharaoh's aspirations don’t start and end with ancient Egypt. Moreso, the next mainline historical Total War aims to capture the struggles and instability of a time period for which ancient Egypt simply had the best seat in the house. “We wanted to make a game about the collapse of the Bronze Age,” Creative Assembly Sofia’s  Milcho Vasilev, lead battle designer on Total War: Pharaoh, tells me. “There’s a lot of mystery surrounding it, and we wanted to uncover it.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.\nIn this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.\nIt's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.\n Read more",

There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.\nEver since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.\nBut it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.\nRead more",

Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name.

          "description": "Playing Diablo 4 gave me a real case of the \"have I changed, or have the games changed?\", and I think the answer is \"yes\". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warfcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo III, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.\nTo wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

An AI could probably replicate my writing style quite thoroughly, because there are at present many thousands of my - mine, my own - words on the internet, and they and everything else have and are being scraped by AI. This thought process is as a result of a few AI things intersecting with my workspace at once recently. Several of them are quite funny, and also not.

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

And if you’d like an early teaser of what’s in store, there’s a free prologue chapter available now, letting you explore a slice of the Southern Gothic mansion.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase. \nRead more",

          "description": "I didn't get as deep into The Lord of the Rings: Gollum as our reviewist Rachel, but I do share her view that it is not A Good Game. In fact, I’ve had about as much fun with it as I would on a spa day in the Barad-dûr sulfur pits. Between the soulless platforming, undercooked stealth, tedious storytelling, and framerate stuttering so bad it’s got me killed twice, Gollum is perilously short on likeable qualities. Especially if you’re not into LOTR lore, or fine hattery.\nIn my unclad head, then, Gollum’s highlight so far has been DLSS 3. It’s one of just a few dozen games to support the newest, most artificially intelligent version of Nvidia’s deep learning-powered upscaler, and frankly makes a very compelling argument for switching it on. Graphics card allowing, obviously.\nRead more",

          "description": "I love it when you 1-2 Switch\nNintendo dropped a bit of a surprise last night. Everybody 1-2 Switch, a follow-up to Switch launch title 1-2 Switch, is launching on June 30.\nThe listing popped up on the Nintendo eShop, prior to an official announcement on Twitter. It's coming out digitally and physically on June 30 for $29.99.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1664438932728168450\nAccording to the eShop description, you can use Joy-Con controllers or smart devices, with certain games only available in smart device mode.\nAs for what games you can play, there aren't a ton of details. There's everything from \"balloons to aliens,\" with a \"mix\" of games and modes. And also, whatever this horse-head guy is up to.\nPlayers can split up into teams and compete, seeing who can win a certain number of games first. There are also some variations to add more challenge or rules, too.\nSwitching it up\nWhile the actual announcement was a little out of the blue, we did hear about this sequel through a report last year. It was claimed to be in development, would include games like musical chairs and Bingo, and was also apparently not doing well in internal play-tests.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpHDJRGuL7w\nNow, at least, it seems like Nintendo is pushing this one out the door. Though it's not really getting the pomp and circumstance you'd expect for a new release. Either way, looks like Switch parties will have something new to do at the end of the month.\nIt's interesting that phones are playing a role too, as the original 1-2 Switch was a showcase for the Joy-Cons themselves. But at a lower price and with more readily available controllers than just Joy-Cons, we'll see how this one fares on June 30.\nThe post Nintendo announces Everybody 1-2 Switch for the end of June appeared first on Destructoid.",

I've noticed a few spoilers dancing around out in the wild, though some of the wilder secrets have had a good lid kept by the player base. This is one of, or possibly the most, story-driven take I've seen on Zelda. It's not just the cutscenes, but the dialogue. The world.

I was able to play a pre-release build of the game for my review, which you can find here. In short, I have some concerns about the game in the long run, but otherwise I had a lot of fun playing it!\nThat said, I learned many lessons during my time with the game.

When Duke Nukem 3D was released in 1996, first-person shooters were widely using very abstract level design. Doom 2 was supposed to have levels that were set on Earth, but did it actually look like Earth? Not really.\nMost of Duke Nukem 3D was set in Los Angeles. While its best-designed levels all took place in space, the most memorable and interesting ones were set in movie theatres and drive-thrus. I can’t describe how exciting this was for me at the time without sounding really stupid, but just trust me, it was amazing.\nWith that in mind, the Duke It Out in DC expansion pack was mind-blowing.

The beta will take place on PS4 from June 5 through to June 11.\nThe beta will allow all PS4 owners to check out an updated version of the excellent 2010 sequel, which is the final KoF title to date to feature 2D animation for its super-fast and highly intense gameplay. Several modes will be available to all, including Practice Lobby, Online Vs. and Customization. Over the course of the six-day beta, SNK will be gathering data to analyze how well the new netcode is sitting.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJjObBRrk4\nIt's marvelous that KoF XIII is getting the upgrade, as it is truly one of SNK's greatest releases of all time, and fully deserving a life within this generation and the next. It's frustrating that, as they always seem to do, SNK has picked an odd time to run this King of Fighters XIII beta, literally days after the launch of Capcom's Street Fighter 6. But regardless, this is good news for the KoF faithful, and here's hoping that the love for KoF XIII can prevail in both the online and competitive markets.\nKing of Fighters XIII Global Match is available now on PC.

Interpol Uniform. Cammy is sure to turn heads in her borderline obscene battle suit, while Juri gets her biker gear back, albeit missing the black undershirt. Damn, Capcom were feeling particularly thirsty with this release.\nFor the newcomers, Marisa has an incredible cream suit reminiscent of Like a Dragon's Kazuma Kiryu, while Manon simply stuns in an haute couture deal fresh from the streets of Paris. \"Drip\", or something. Of all the characters, Dee Jay Maximum perhaps pulls the biggest switcheroo, as his classic Super Street Fighter II gear makes him look like an entirely different character! All in, everyone looks pretty rad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNKO77QDCN4\nHow to unlock the Street Fighter 6 alt costumes\nSo, how do you bag these skins? Well, they can be purchased from the in-game store for 50 Fighter Coins each to 2500 Drive Tickets (this includes all color variants). They can be unlocked by playing through World Tour and maxing out your personal bond with the respective characters. Once the bond hits 100, then the character's outfit (complete with the color variants) unlocks for use in Arcade, Vs., and other one-on-one modes.\nNo doubt, as Capcom is wont to do, the cast will receive a huge array of additional DLC costumes as SF6 passes through its lifespan, to be purchased via Fighter Coins and/or Drive Tickets.\nStreet Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 shows off its launch roster’s alt costumes appeared first on Destructoid.",

After revealing the name and direction of the second part of the remake trilogy, the team behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth posted a development update today.\nProducer Yoshinori Kitase provided the update on Twitter. The post asks how development is progressing on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\n\"Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan,\" Kitase said. \"We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1664617912060231680/\nThat's the extent of it, so there's no indication whether the original winter window is moving or not. Final Fantasy XVI is just around the corner anyways, so I personally wouldn't be surprised if Square Enix doesn't start talking about Rebirth more until XVI is out.\nYou can (not) redo\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is the follow-up to Final Fantasy VII Remake, which both is and isn't an actual remake of Final Fantasy VII. While it's retelling a big part of the early story of FFVII, Remake eventually strikes out and forges its own path. Its story looks set to diverge with Rebirth.\nWe did just get a Crisis Core remaster to help newcomers catch up with the story of Zack Fair. And Ever Crisis, a mobile game, is set to somehow encapsulate the VII timeline. It'll be interesting to see how this new expansion of the Final Fantasy VII multi-verse comes together over the next few years.\nSounds like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is at least progressing along well, though. Meanwhile, if you can't wait for that, a new Final Fantasy debuts in June.\nThe post Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team is working on nailing down a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Will it be Resident Evil 5?\nThe Resident Evil franchise has been on top of the world lately, especially with the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Now, not wanting to stop this juggernaut, Capcom is asking you which other game in the iconic survival horror series you'd like to see get remade, if any.\nThe recent survey poses a few questions about how well people know what's happening in the world of Resident Evil. For example, people are asked whether they follow any of the official social media channels, as well as how familiar they are with the entries, be they games or movie adaptations. One of the final questions then gives you the chance to suggest which installment you'd like to see a remake of.\n\nWith Capcom flying high in terms of sales, no doubt the studio is interested in where to take things from here. It should be pointed out that the survey results won't necessarily mean there'll be another RE remake in the pipeline. However, there have already been rumors that the series' 2009 release, Resident Evil 5 could be getting reimagined, but there's no solid evidence for that yet.\nGiven that the remake of Resident Evil 4 has sold millions of copies, it's not surprising that Capcom wants to keep bringing back older entries. At this point, however, anything past the fourth entry doesn't quite fit the \"classic\" status of the earlier installments. RE5 is certainly a mainline series entry but arguably may not necessarily warrant a full remake.\nMaybe the results of this survey will lead Capcom into deciding an official remake of it is the way forward.\nThe post Capcom survey asks which Resident Evil you want remade next appeared first on Destructoid.",

While this doesn't beat out the early-day success of free-to-play fighter MultiVersus, it does beat all full-price fighting games releases to date, toppling the previous king, Warner Bros.' bloodlust scrapper Mortal Kombat 11, by just over 30,000 players.\nStreet Fighter 6, which officially launches today after a year of build-up, has received high accolades across the board, becoming one of the highest-rated fighting games of all time on review aggregate sites such as Metacritic. Capcom has achieved this level of praise by producing a feature-packed, great-looking, and rock-solid sequel, which has been delivered to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox players, and looks set to lead the charge into a bold new era of fighting titles currently set to ignite the scene.\nStreet Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "For all the coffee you'll spill playing Alan Wake 2\nVideo game merch can be hit or miss for me, but one in particular caught my eye this morning. Remedy Entertainment is teaming up with Finnish lighting company Airam to release a special Oh Deer Diner thermos inspired by Alan Wake.\nThe special thermos is slated to arrive in September 2023, just ahead of Alan Wake 2, on Remedy's storefront. As you might remember from the first Alan Wake, you could get an achievement for finding the hidden thermos bottles littered throughout the game.\n\"In the sequel, the thermos plays a significantly more important role,\" Remedy communications director Thomas Puha said in a press release. \"This got us excited about the idea of creating an authentic Oh Deer Diner thermos for our fans.\"\nThe collaboration is between two Finnish companies, Remedy and Airam. It's a 0.45 liter bottle with a glass interior. Perfect for that cup of coffee you might want to enjoy while booting up a scary experience in the fall.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOWxNAd3sg4\nAlso, enjoy the reveal trailer above, featuring a special guest appearance from a Control character you might recognize.\nOh, deer\nAs I said above, video game merch is tricky. For me personally, I don't like stuff that's a bit too loud or just a giant logo. Something a bit more subtle, that feels like a representation of that game world rather than an advertisement for it, is my jam.\nSo with that in mind, even though I've only played a little bit of the first Alan Wake, I dig this thermos. It's sleek and looks well-made. It's a subtle nod, one that might get you an \"ah\" from friends who've played the game, without looking like a billboard.\nBasically, I wish more merch was like this. Fewer over-logo'd T-shirts, more useful items with smart in-game ties.\nThe post Remedy has a limited edition Alan Wake thermos on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cruelty Squad, for example, features eye-piercingly garish colors and spaghetti-nest level design, but it winds up being fun to play with its dark but off-kilter sense of humor and deep (sometimes unintentionally broken) mechanics.\nSome people take Cruelty Squad way too seriously.

You manage the weight and integrity of your airship, expand your facilities, and search for new technologies and resources.\nhttps://youtu.be/aMuE0W8XfC4\nThe developers state that “The Early Access version will offer plenty of mechanics and activities to play within a vast world ready to be explored, all of which will engage players for many hours.” They go on to clarify that the amount of hours is roughly 15. The developers also note that they plan to include co-op in Forever Skies later in Early Access.\nDid you ever play Guns of Icarus Online? It was (and, I guess, still is) a great airship game where you and your friends battle against opposing crews. Players would typically take the role of either a gunner, pilot, or engineer. I personally liked being an engineer, and jumping between the various components of the ship and keeping them in tip-top shape and not on fire.\nFor that matter, my favorite part of Subnautica was exploring the ocean while personalizing my big submarine.\nWhat I’m saying is that Forever Skies seems like my jam, and I’m looking forward to it.\nForever Skies hits PC via Steam Early Access on June 22, 2023.

While the release was praised for its quality gameplay and usage of the Marvel license, this, unfortunately, did not equate to sales, with the game being considered an unsuccessful commercial release by parent company Take-Two Interactive. Much like another comic-book release, Marvel's Avengers, Midnight Suns was a title that was designed to have a relatively long life in the gaming market.\nThe layoffs at Firaxis continue a miserable trend of cuts across the entire industry. Since January, roles have been lost at various high-profile developers and publishers including Microsoft, Riot Games, Sega, Twitch, and Ubisoft. Just last month, it was announced that Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt RED had also laid off members of studio The Molasses Flood, following a restart of the upcoming Witcher spin-off Project Sirius.\nFiraxis is latest video game studio hit by layoffs [Axios Gaming]\nThe post Marvel’s Midnight Suns developer Firaxis hit by layoffs in ‘sharpening of focus’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s been a record year for anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, which is immensely depressing.\nSo, for this very important Pride Month, the itch.io Queer Games Bundle returns with the goal of providing some much-needed funds to LGBTQ+ creators who would often be otherwise overlooked. These are people who just want to make or supplement a living making games, art, and other content, and the bundle gives them some money to do just that.\nThe Queer Games Bundle describes itself as “A bundle of over 450 games, software, and zines from nearly 300 queer artists across itch.io.” A glance over its immense contents shows everything from more mainstream titles like Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance to emotionally charged art games like He Fucked the Girl Out of Me.\nThe hosts of the bundle are suggesting a $60 all-in price tag, but you can pay what you want so long as it’s over $10. Proceeds go to developers who opted-in to get some of the funding.\nNote that there is a wide range of topics covered in these games, books, zines, and tabletops, including some decidedly 18+ things. While wading into uncomfortable territory can nurture empathy and an understanding in your fellow humans, your priority should always be to be kind to yourself, so watch what you load up.\nSo, if you’d like a massive buffet of delicious queer art content to dig into or would just like to support the community of queer creators, take a look at the Queer Games Bundle over on itch.io.

I haven’t played all the titles, but more than a few. Getting to try out the next game in the series, Total War: Pharaoh, was a tantalizing proposition. The new features they’re showing off sound pretty appreciable.\nI was given the chance to preview three different battle setups within Total War: Pharaoh. Mainly, they highlight the new weather systems, but the third battle option had me defending against a siege on a city; the perfect playground to watch burn.\nHaving conquered the battlefield, I can tell you that this is the same Total War experience, at least when it comes to battles.

Set in the year 2090, the narrative concerns a brutal conflict between the Oceania Cooperative Union (O.C.U.) and the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.) — a conflict fought with devastating mech units known as \"Wanzers\". Lol.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfNhYqgGPLE\nPlayers engage in strategic combat across an increasingly desolate wasteland, battling it out with their comrades in a dramatic, story-driven tale that encourages the player to approach the conflict from both sides of the curtain. The two plots intertwine in order to ask and answer each other's questions. The new remake includes a new localization, a reorchestrated soundtrack, and various tweaks and rebalances to the game's modes and mechanics. You can check out Zoey Handley's review of the Switch release here.\nFront Mission 1st: Remake launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on June 30, priced at around $35 USD. A 10% discount is available until July 12, and a demo is available now on PC.\nThe post Front Mission 1st: Remake hits PlayStation, PC, and Xbox this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

That growth has enabled the sort of projects that might have been unheard of only a decade ago, with price points and complexity of play that can seem astounding to newcomers. Nonetheless, the dedicated audience for board games continues to clamor for ever higher-end projects with deep systems that enable truly epic adventures.

But now, when I do hear it, the Shrine it is pointing to is so obscure that I spend hours trying to find the source of the noise.\nI am far beyond the friendly sight of the bright green spiral reaching into the sky that I can see from miles away.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. \nIn a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.” \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\npic.twitter.com/O4KdGlh4gy\nJune 2, 2023\nWhile not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. \nFor more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams \"and see which group can win a certain number of games first,\" while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. \nEverybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. \nWhile this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. \nIt's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch. \nAre you picking up Everybody 1-2-Switch?

The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director.

This tattoo connects more widely to the world of FFXVI, Valisthea, and magic’s place in it. \nDuring my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human.

Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nThen, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNow, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month. \n[Source: Abema Times via VGC]",

The presumption might be that developer Creative Business Unit III wanted this game to have more violence to accompany its new action-heavy combat, but that’s not the case. The team put little thought into the rating – it just came naturally, according to various members of CBUIII I spoke to for our FFXVI cover story. \n“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

          "description": "For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.\nPlayers race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. \n\n\nModes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. \nThe popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.",

It seems one might be on the way. \nAccording to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called \"Umbrella Chronicles,\" and it's receiving $2 million. \nIf you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. \nIt's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details. \n[Source: Sudbury.com via PCGamesN]\nDo you want a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City?

In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing, \"It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble).\"\nWill you be checking out Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on Steam?

          "description": "Designing combat in a Final Fantasy game seems like a double-edged sword. On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players. But it’s impossible to please everyone when making big changes like developer Creative Business Unit III is doing with Final Fantasy XVI – using a real-time action combat system that couldn’t be further from the series’ classic turn-based roots. \nAs someone who loves the franchise’s turn-based format and its more action-forward design as of late, and as someone who’s played FFXVI for more than five hours at this point, I’m quite pleased with the combat. It’s fast-paced, action-heavy, and perhaps most importantly, fitting of this world and these characters. I especially like the singular focus on Clive,…",

Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899).

There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

          "description": "The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.

Here, Clive meets Cidolfus Telamon, or Cid for short – because this is Final Fantasy, after all. Shortly after, Cid brings Clive to a place dubbed Cid’s hideaway. \nThis hideaway is one of the main hubs in FFXVI. While I’m not sure of its location in Valisthea, the continent where the game takes place, it looks built into a cavernous structure.

And if its combat reminds you of DMC, it’s probably because the combat director of FFXVI is Ryota Suzuki, who helped design combat on Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5. But he also worked on Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. \nWhile the DMC inspirations laced within FFXVI’s combat are hard to miss, Suzuki told me that Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 inspired some of FFXVI's systems as well. \n“There’s actually something from Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 that we took and put into Final Fantasy XVI, and that is, as you may or may not know, in Marvel Vs.

          "description": "Atari and developer Sneakybox have announced Days of Doom, an apocalyptic turn-based tactical roguelite. The game hopes to subvert the expectations of those who are tired of the brown and gray color palettes of other apocalypse settings by placing the action over vibrant and colorful backdrops as you battle through hordes of zombies, raiders, and mutant lizards. \nNavigating the wasteland to reach a sanctuary will require strategy, as you must combat the encroaching mutated forces using your group of distinct survivors. Beyond the turn-based tactics at play, you must also manage your scarce collection of resources and keep your wits about you as you maneuver through the hordes of the undead.\n\nEach of the eight survivor classes features unique abilities that can be used to shift your fortunes in battle. For example, the Pyro class allows you to burn enemies and leave them with residual damage each turn while combining the Hydromancer with the Thrasher can drench enemies with water before electrocuting them for a devastating synergy. Players will need to use these abilities to their advantage and think strategically with these abilities to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAnd, of course, with it being a roguelite game, players can expect each run to feel unique. More than 50 randomly occurring events present risk-reward scenarios for players during their runs, while more than 70 collectible items and runes can help you turn the odds in your favor in your given run. However, as you play several runs and make progress, you unlock permanent upgrades, such as party size increases and resource accumulation speed.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nDays of Doom arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Atari VCS later this year.",
