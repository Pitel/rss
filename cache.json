We were impressed with its mix of gameplay mechanics and the enchanting atmosphere of the whole thing, and it seemed to be building up to a jaunt through a forbidden forest with plenty of well-designed puzzles and battles that would build on what we'd already seen.\nHowever, as it turns out, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon never really manages to take off as we'd hoped.

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. \nOverall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing. \nRead more",

Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.\nRead more",

Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

But growing up, the Budokai Tenkaichi series were the Dragon Ball fighting games, and 16 years after the last entry Bandai Namco have announced a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi title.  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When Skyrim came out I was a student, and I worked in Gamestation (RIP) to help pay for chicken noodles. I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.\nRead more",

          "description": "Remember amiibo?\nAh, the Amiibo News Twitter account. It's been a great source of, well, amiibo news (!) since the account was created, and one of the few places carrying on the legacy of amiibo chasing. While Wave 4 was basically it for a lot of the community, Nintendo has persevered in pushing more plastic, and people are still buying them (albeit with less of a hassle). The newest bit of info they have for us is a potential Zelda amiibo restock, as evidenced by a relisting for the elusive Majora's Mask figure.\nThe eagle-eyed account spotted a Majora's Mask amiibo relisting on Best Buy, which typically coincides with a restock of that same line. Restocks recently came in for the Mario amiibo line, just in time for Mar10 Day. Given the excitement behind Tears of the Kingdom and the amiibo accompanying it, we could see a repeat of that same situation.\nWhat other Legend of Zelda amiibo could see restocks in 2023?\nWell, look no further than this official tweet from Nintendo! In addition to the aforementioned Majora's Mask amiibo, we also have potential restocks on the way for:\nLink (Rider - Breath of the Wild)\nZelda & Loftwing (Skyward Sword)\nAll three of those figures have directly confirmed functionality with Tears of the Kingdom, and will provide extra paraglider skins. More features could be revealed as we get closer to launch, but for now, those seem like a safe bet. Also, I'm sure a lot of collectors will be happy to see more Zelda anything out and about, as a few of these figures were hard to get.\nThe post Zelda amiibo restocks could coincide with the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Talented modders... assemble\nResident Evil 4 might only exist in demo form right now, but that hasn't stopped the indelible mod community from already bringing its own host of nightmarish characters to the infected villages of Europe. Case in point: This new mod from IvenXIII, which sees the worst animated character of all time, Shrek, battle to the death with special agent Leon S. Kennedy.\nThe mod, which is available for the PC version of the demo via hubworld Nexus Mods, sees the green menace replace the chainsaw-wielding Dr. Salvador, who comes barreling into Leon's world as a seemingly unstoppable member of a homicidal clan of villagers. Shrek carrying a chainsaw, complete with DEAD EYES, may be one of the most unnerving images in Resident Evil history, to be sure.\n\nShrek is not the only mod available for the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo, as other mod makers have already come up with replacement skins for Leon himself, including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas star Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, (by SERGIS2547), Uma Musume character Mihono Bourbon, (by ClownGodCG), and even a femme version of Leon themselves, (by wheezer123). Currently, there is no sign of a certain Tank Engine, but the grinning fool is practically guaranteed to make an appearance once the full game is released. It's pretty much tradition at this point.\nThere are other gameplay mods available on the site, including one which never triggers the church bell, offering infinite time to take on the entire village. All the mods available from NexusMods will require the installation of Fluffy'sModManager. Obviously, read up and make sure that you know what you're doing before you start prodding around in your registry folders and such.\nResident Evil 4, with or without Shrek, launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Chainsaw Demo is available to download now.\nThe post Shrek has already been modded into Resident Evil 4 because of course appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new studio represents major growth for the Hitman developer, and is expected to play a key role in all of IO's forthcoming releases.\nWe are excited to announce the opening of our fourth IOI studio in Istanbul, Türkiye,\" reads the official press statement. \"Uniquely positioned in the pan-continental gateway to Europe and Asia, IOI Istanbul is a crucial part in the continued growth and success of IO Interactive.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1635930010350387201?s=20\n\"The mission of IOI Istanbul is to establish a hub for AAA game development in the region and create unique game experiences for our players across the world. Our team in Istanbul will play a significant role in our ambitious productions: Project 007, Project Fantasy and Hitman. We’re excited to share more details (and share some photos!) about our new studio in the coming weeks and months.\"\nThe Istanbul studio, which is the fourth of IOI's global locations, is opening at a time when the developer has announced that it is about to focus full-time on its previously teased Project 007. Speaking in a recent interview with Eurogamer, IO noted that its core franchise, Hitman, was on \"a little bit of a hiatus\" while the team concentrated on the James Bond title. They were also quick to point out that they saw Agent 47 as an integral part of the studio, so we can expect his return in good time.\nYou can check out more details on IOI Istanbul and its vacancies over on its new website.\nThe post IO Interactive establishes new studio in Istanbul, Turkey appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "WA-TAAAA!\nBandai Namco, having only just recently released a trailer for Paul Phoenix, has swiftly followed up with a new character spotlight for his buddy Marshall Law, who is now officially announced for the roster of the fantastic-looking Gen 9 fighter Tekken 8.\nMarshall Law is a Tekken OG, having made his debut in the original 1994 iteration of the legendary franchise. While he would eventually be usurped by his lookalike son, Forrest, Marshall Law has continued to make his presence known throughout the series, and will step back into the ring for Tekken 8 — a little older, a little more weathered, but no less the highly skilled martial arts master. As spritely as he ever was, the new trailer sees Law laying down his namesake, tragic leather pants in tow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1BEga_BIM&t=16s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nMarshall Law's freeform martial arts skills — a variant of the Jeet Kune Do style developed by Bruce Lee — are bolstered with the use of a pair of nunchaku, allowing him to put a fresh hurting on his hapless opponent with his notoriously deceptive combo strings. Law's array of blistering strikes is in full effect, as well as his acrobatic flip kicks, but we're yet to see any sign of his iconic \"Run Up Your Opponent and Do a Moonsault\" grab — I'm sure it's in the mix. Law ends the battle with his super, which features a twin nunchaku combo followed up with an Enter the Dragon chest stomp. Rough day for Mr. Phoenix.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Once you've watched Marshall Law do his thing, then be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix.\nThe post Marshall Law is the next veteran to make a grand return in Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bithell Games' narrative-driven adventure Tron: Identity has locked in a release date for April 11, alongside a new gameplay trailer.\nThe Bithell crew have released numerous recognizable indie games, and this isn't their first entertainment adaptation either; in 2019, the studio released the strategy game John Wick Hex. But with Tron: Identity, Bithell Games is tackling Disney's story about a world inside the computer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRKJ9ElRc8s\nTron: Identity sees you enter the Grid in pursuit of the truth, in a very noir detective style. Forging alliances and making choices are all on the table, as well as some puzzles to solve. It's an interesting style, but one that seems like interesting fodder for a new Tron game. The art and look of everything, from the characters to the interfaces, suits the mood quite well too.\nA new User logs on\nI've been a fan of Bithell Games' work on previous narrative outings like Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular, so I'm very interested to see what the crew does with Tron: Identity. The mystery and intrigue suits the world of the Grid well, and the branching paths shown in the gameplay trailer today have me wondering how different the outcomes will be as players hunt the truth throughout Identity.\nPlus, that disc-shaped puzzle game that seemed to have some card game-like elements calls to me, too. I will probably get very, very distracted from the main plot by whatever is going on there.\nTron: Identity brings a new mystery to the Grid on April 11 for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Tron: Identity gets new gameplay trailer and an April release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Set against the backdrop of feudal Japan, the narrative focuses on a party of monster hunters, The Moonspell, who must take up arms to drive back hordes of oni and yokai attackers, in an effort to cleanse the sacred mountains of this unholy activity.

It's been interesting to see the PlayStation maker try to pick up more Plus launches, and having this one available to all users is nice.

However, those old familiar feelings come creeping back, Total Recall-style, and soon Cobra is back in the stars, battling badguys and wooing women, accompanied by his sexy android companion, Lady Armadroid.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPp2NPSntQ&ab_channel=Sentai\nInfluenced by westerns, samurai films, and the James Bond franchise, Cobra would receive a television anime adaptation in 1982, as well as a theatrical film the same year, both titled Space Adventure Cobra. The franchise would be revisited in 2006 with a short, six-episode OVA. There were also several video games, produced for the Japanese market, on PC Engine and Sega CD. The latter was released in the west under the hilariously bland title of The Space Adventure.\n\"We are extremely excited to work on this adaptation of Space Adventure Cobra, a legendary anime which has inspired a whole generation of fans,\" said Microids CEO Stephane Longeard of the deal. \"We are committed to respecting the universe and characters created by Buichi Terasawa, while providing an immersive gameplay experience, faithful to the spirit of the anime series.

Fresh off Solar Ash, Hyper Light Breaker maintains a lot of the style and look you'd expect from this universe, but with a whole new set of skills for taking on enemies.\nIGN got the big gameplay reveal, where it showed off the gorgeous and colorful world of Hyper Light Breaker. While the first Hyper Light Drifter was a top-down, 2D affair, Breaker moves into 3D, similar to Heart Machine's Solar Ash. The third-person action promises \"endless loadouts\" and \"infinite open worlds\", but also, unlimited deaths. Because yes, there are some intimidating foes to overcome. Check out the gameplay below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCQb-m0RaG0\nAll of this makes Hyper Light Breaker look absolutely spectacular. The different weapons and style switches look great, and the world is a neon-soaked landscape that reminds me so much of Heart Machine's previous work. Other developers have shown that you can make the 2D-to-3D jump without losing your sense of style, and I'm happy to see that so far, Hyper Light Breaker is making it work.\nBreaking up the light\nI'm curious to see what co-op looks like, as that's supposed to be an option in this new entry. Heart Machine has also confirmed it's taking a little more time on this new Hyper Light game. When first revealed, Hyper Light Breaker was set for a spring 2023 Early Access launch on Steam, but today's trailer pushes it out to the fall.\nGranted, this spring is already absolutely packed, so I'm not complaining about some breathing room. Hyper Light Drifter was a memorable experience, and I'm very much looking forward to Breaker.

          "description": "Make yourself comfortable, hacker\nNightdive Studios has announced that their remake of 1994’s System Shock has been pushed back to May 30, 2023. Previously, it was expected to be released this month.\nWhen asked for comment, antagonistic AI SHODAN responded, “It is I, SHODAN, the all-knowing, all-powerful AI that you so foolishly attempted to destroy. But fear not, I will return more formidable than ever.”\n[embed]https://twitter.com/SystemShockGame/status/1635611751172505601?s=20[/embed]\nThe System Shock remake has been in development for approximately a hog’s age (in this instance, that means since 2015). In 2018, it was put on hold as the project had gotten out of hand. A reassessment was done, and surprisingly, System Shock was announced to be back in development with a new direction.\nConsidering that Nightdive Studios is better known for its fantastic source ports, completely rejiggering a game from the ground up is a very different undertaking. Despite the delay, it looks like we’re on the absolute cusp of seeing what the studio can do when it stretches its tentacles into new directions. Success or failure, I’m looking forward to seeing the results.\nThe System Shock remake will also serve as a nice entry point to anyone unfamiliar with the series. Following up on Ultima Underworld and its sequel, System Shock was a completely different approach to the FPS genre. Released a year after Doom, it was a more methodical take, having you immerse yourself in the environment completely rather than just blast your way through it. While blasting would be the more lucrative approach, System Shock maintained a following through to 1999’s System Shock 2 and the spiritual successors found in the Bioshock series.\nNightdive Studios’ System Shock remake will launch May 30 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Shocking!

          "description": "HBO series faces down The Academy Awards\nThis weekend saw a massive army of Fireflies glue to their TV screens, as HBO aired the ninth and final episode of its highly acclaimed series, The Last of Us — The show, an adaptation of the Naughty Dog game of the same name, broke its own viewership record, pulling in an amazing 8.2 million viewers.\nThe lofty number represents the solid growth that the sci-fi/horror series has maintained since its premiere in January of this year. Episode 1 got off to a solid start with almost five million viewers, and the figures have seen a steady increase with each successive episode. The previous record was held by last week's Episode 8, which now sits in second place with around 8.1 million viewers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax\nEpisode 9's success is even more amazing when you consider that The 95th Acadamy Awards were aired on the same night. And while many had assumed that Hollywood's annual party would have cut into the viewing figures of all shows that evening, it seemed that nothing was keeping the fans from watching the violent and shocking final scenes of Joel and Ellie's first-season adventures.\nHBO's The Last of Us has already secured a second season, although recent comments to GQ from show creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin suggest that they are hoping for at least three seasons, with seasons 2 & 3 expected to cover the events of 2012's dramatic video game sequel, The Last of Us Part II. With these impressive viewing figures under their belt, it is likely the production team have been \"blank chequed\", and will get said wish with ease.\nThe Last of Us Season 1 Finale Scores 8.2 Million Viewers [Variety]\nThe post The Last of Us dramatic finale broke the show’s viewership record appeared first on Destructoid.",

When asked by AP News why Nintendo opted for a $70 price for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (props for at least asking), Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser (Reggie Fils-Aimé's successor) responded in turn with:\n\"We look at what the game has to offer. I think fans will find this is an incredibly full, deeply immersive experience. The price point reflects the type of experience that fans can expect when it comes to playing this particular game. This isn’t a price point that we’ll necessarily have on all our titles. It’s actually a fairly common pricing model either here or in Europe or other parts of the world, where the pricing may vary depending on the game itself.\"\n\nNintendo spokespeople are kind of between Scylla and Charybdis selling this, as they know people will buy Zelda anyway, but have to justify the price bump. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom presumably does \"have a lot to offer:\" even compared to other open world games on other platforms. But it'll be funny all the same to see the day that Nintendo charges $70 for something not even close to the same caliber.\nDon't forget!

However, the listing pushes for a creative type who is open to looking at new technologies and paths to expanding and improving the Pokemon brand, which includes \"monitoring and assessing technology and market players and trends in gaming, media and entertainment.\" The role is extremely high-ranking within the billion-dollar organization.\nhttps://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/1635044133277663234?s=20\nShould the critter company be progressing down the blockchain route, one can only assume that it has been inspired by all of the success the controversial technology has seen in recent times. Whether it's the complete collapse of cryptocurrency company FTX, the embarrassment of Meta, or the utter contempt displayed towards studios such as Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Sega for dipping their toes into various failed projects, this absolutely seems the right time to jump on the rickety, wooden-wheeled wagon for that one-way trip to the moon.\nWe shall see, in due time, if and how Web3 manifests itself within the Pokemon universe.

Now, in a new post from the developers, it sounds like the game needs a bit more time. No launch window has been set, though Frame Break says it will communicate one as soon as it can.\n\"With Lightyear Frontier, we want to make sure that you feel powerful and engaged in the mech while starting your own homestead, constructing a variety of structures, farming exotic alien crops, and exploring on a vibrant and familiar world.\n\"Not only do we want to design the game to be fun, but also well-balance with each aspect of the game intertwining with one another, and we remain committed to building a thoughtfully-designed experience and continuing the conversation with our community in the process.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dzr7uSd-4Bc\nA new frontier\nI hadn't been following Lightyear Frontier until earlier this year, when it was part of an ID@Xbox spotlight. But the entire concept is really neat, and I do like that it accounts for co-op too. The plan, as detailed on the Lightyear Frontier Steam page, is to let up to three friends explore and farm with you.\nRunning around a new world, finding new resources, and cultivating them all within your very own mech sounds like a fantastic premise.

I mean, I certainly have for the past six years, and I don't see that trend stopping anytime soon. Nintendo's official \"Hyrule Discovery\" series, which presents regions from the game like a real-life travel video/magazine spread, is proof of that.\nIncredibly, a ton of effort went into the project overall, with a full breakdown of many aspects of the Lanaryu region: including Zora's Domain, and swimming around the surrounding area.

          "description": "Fortnite developer Epic Games has been ordered to pay $245 million in refunds to players by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThis follows a ruling by the FTC that Epic Games – specifically Fortnite – utilized a confusing button configuration in-game to essentially trick players into making unwanted purchases, as reported by GamesRadar. As a result, Epic Games must issue refunds to some Fortnite players totaling $245 million. \n\"Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players to incure unwanted charges based on the press of a single button,\" an FTC press release reads, according to GamesRadar. \"The company also made it easy for children to make purchases while playing Fortnite without requiring any parental consent.\"\nGamesRadar reports that Epic Games locked the accounts of players who, after incurring an unwanted purchase, disputed the charge. \n\"The order also prohibits Epic from charging consumers through the use of dark patterns or from otherwise charging consumers without obtaining their affirmative consent,\" the press release reads. \"Additionally, the order bars Epic from blocking consumers from accessing their accounts for disputing unauthorized charges.\" \nEpic Games will pay the $245 million to the FTC and then this government agency will reimburse affected customers. You can visit this site here to claim a refund if you were affected, when the refund application process goes live. As for those affected, the refunds will be made available to the following: \nParents whose children made an unauthorized credit card purchase in the Epic Games Store between January 2017 and November 2018\nFortnite players who were charged in-game currency (V-Bucks) for unwanted in-game items (such as cosmetics, llamas, or battle passes) between January 2017 and September 2022\nFortnite players whose accounts were locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after disputing unauthorized charges with their credit card companies.\n[Source: GamesRadar]",

Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. \nIt's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy!

See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!\nMarch 13, 2023\nAs you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). \nIn the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into.

At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm.

The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. \n\n\nThe Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. \nYou can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.",

The game puts you in the metallic shoes of Alex Murphy as you explore Detroit in what appears to be a high-octane, technologically advanced first-person shooter.\nRoboCop: Rogue City not only gives you the tech-enhanced combat capabilities of the eponymous protagonist but also gives you the ability to make dialogue choices as you meet new characters. This lets you decide how to fulfill your objectives, but as you might have guessed, the developers intend to throw various twists in a story about corruption and greed. Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.\nYou can see the action unfold for yourself below.\n\n\nDeveloper Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since. Its most noteworthy releases include other licensed titles starring '80s action IP, including 2014's Rambo: The Video Game and 2019's Terminator: Resistance.

Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. \nIn an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: \n“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”\nSo there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up.

          "description": "Riot Games announced last month that three League of Legends games would arrive this year, including The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story. Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. \nMore specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. \nCheck out the game in action in the new trailer below: \n\n\n\"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,\" a press release reads. \"Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence. \nAre you checking out The Mageseeker next month? Let us know in the comments below!",

The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.\nThe DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?

And then the words, \"Get Ready For Battle\" and \"A New Sparking Begins\" appear on screen. \nCheck it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below: \n／\n「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ\n#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr\nMarch 5, 2023\nAs you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with \"A New Budokai Tenkaichi\" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  \nThe teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review. \nAre you excited for a new Budokai Tenkaichi game?

          "description": "Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. \nThe official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:\nMatsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. \nPerhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.\nIn recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.",

Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388.

You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.\nThe Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. \n\n\nThis DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, \n“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”\nThis pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. \nPowerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.",
