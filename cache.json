          "description": "Class is in session.\nEveryone’s school days were a gauntlet of different challenges. From exams to social drama to the occasional run-in with a schoolyard bully, everyone had a bit of a hard time, but spare a thought to the poor headteachers who had to keep a building full of hormonal teenagers from descending into utter chaos. Let’s School from Pathea Games (My Time at Sandrock) gives a nod to these brave individuals and shows just how bogged down in bureaucracy everyone’s headteacher really is. No wonder they always had such a short temper with us.\nThe gameplay of Let’s School isn’t that different from other management sims like Two Point Campus. You inherit a rundown school from your old headteacher and are tasked with helping it achieve greatness once again. However, where Two Point Campus leans into the whimsy of running an educational institute, Let’s School instead focuses on mundane tasks required to keep both students and staff happy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Prepare to die.\nUpon booting it up for the very first time, Darkest Dungeon 2 greets you with a message that plainly informs you that you’re going to fail… a lot… while trying to overcome its many challenges. It does this not to discourage you, but to set expectations. Keeping with the precedent set by the first Darkest Dungeon, this sequel is the kind of game that doesn’t pull its punches as you work to achieve mastery over its various systems. Many may be put off by developer Red Hook Studios' uncompromising approach to difficulty, but those who stick it out will find that Darkest Dungeon 2 offers some of the most rewarding experiences one can find in a roguelike RPG adventure. Perhaps most importantly, this new entry also isn’t afraid to try some new things that set it noticeably apart from its predecessor.\nGetting its first full release on PC back in May 2023 following 18 months of Early Access, Darkest Dungeon 2 takes place in a grim, Lovecraftian world overrun by all manner of undead creatures and eldritch abominations after an academic named The Scholar messed around with an ancient relic called the Iron Crown. All the horrors stem from a mountain looming ominously in the distance, and you’re thus tasked with assembling a team of four adventurers and using their combat and survival skills to help you carry a flame called Hope aboard a stagecoach to the mountain, where you will confront the source of the evil and hopefully rid the land of it for good.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of \"Splatoon mechanics in dungeons\".\n Read more",

It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts.

The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.\nSchim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you're to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you've been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It's a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.\nRead more",

There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime.

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes.

          "description": "I'm not sure if this applies in other countries, but in England we have this thing where you'll stroll down some random suburban street without a care in the world, and stumble on a house that has been absolutely overrun by garden gnomes. A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.\nA hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.\r\n \nRead more",

It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.\n \nRead more",

That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  \"It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7,\" he said, \"but I found it.

          "description": "The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.\n \nRead more",

The little spinning symbol cautioning players against impatient acts of powering down. \"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed,\" goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.\nBut is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know.

          "description": "Apex Legends features crossplay, allowing you to play with your friends on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and even Nintendo Switch, regardless of which platform you are on. This lets players engage in Apex Legends with more of their friends, and it also reduces the time for match queues, which can be a problem on certain servers that are not as populated as others.\n\n\nThe crossplay feature is on by default in Apex Legends, so you’ll have to disable it yourself if you wish to play with and against players on the same platform as yours. While it is possible to turn off crossplay on consoles such as Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch, Respawn Entertainment does not allow players to turn off crossplay on PC.\n\n\nHere is how to disable crossplay in Apex Legends on Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch:\n\n\n\nStart Apex Legends.\n\n\nIn the lobby, open the Game Menu by either choosing the cogwheel icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen or pressing the Options button on Xbox and Playstation, or the + button on Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nSelect Settings.\n\n\nNavigate below to Cross Platform Play.\n\n\nSelect the ‘Disabled’ option to stop crossplay. You can choose ‘Enabled’ to turn on crossplay again.\n\n\n\nImage via Respawn Entertainment\n\n\nKeep in mind that even if crossplay is disabled on your console, if you are queuing up for a match with any PC player, the crossplay will be enabled for those matches.\n\n\nPlayers on a console can avoid queuing up with PC players as there may be a mismatch between players who are using a controller and those who play with a mouse and keyboard. However, with Apex Legends in particular, players on PC often complain about aim assist, which is a slight assistance given to players for aiming when using a controller to play Apex Legends.\n\nThe post How to turn off crossplay in Apex Legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

One, in particular, is error code 769, which can prohibit you from playing a specific game. We're here to explain error code 769 in Roblox and how to fix it.\n\n\nWhat does Roblox error code 769 mean?\n\n\nRoblox error code 769, while it can be frustrating, is not uncommon. It can occur when the game doesn't have suitable administrator privileges or the servers are down. More specifically, it can happen when trying to teleport to another location.\n\n\nHow to fix Roblox error code 769\n\n\nIf you're on PC, right-click on the Roblox file and select 'Run as administrator.' This feature should help clear out the problems unless the servers are down.\n\n\nIn most cases, Roblox error code 769 is tied to a server issue. Check out the game's server status page or Down Detector to get the latest reports. Those who see a spike in problems will likely need to wait until the servers function better. One update was implemented for the teleportation problems on July 1, 2024. However, the error code seems to still appear when the servers are overloaded.\n\n\nImage via Roblox Corporation\n\n\nWhile waiting for the next update, there are proactive steps you can take to resolve the issue. Ensure your internet connection is stable, and check for new patches that may need to be downloaded. Keep in mind that the error code may not be a problem on your end, so just sit tight until the Roblox team figures the situation out.

Hopefully, fear does not exist in your game room. \n\n\nConfirmed levels for this game so far include Topanga Beach, West Valley High, Cobra Kai Dojo, and the All-Valley Tournament.

Unfortunately, this annoying error prevents players from connecting to Roblox and being able to play. Here is how to fix Error Code 264 in Roblox so you can get back to playing.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nError Code 264 Roblox fix\n\n\nIf you are experiencing Error Code 264 in Roblox on July 15, 2024,  it's important to note there is currently and ongoing server outage with Roblox that is triggering this error to appear. However, Error Code 264 in Roblox usually means that you're already loaded into another game world or session on that Roblox account and therefore cannot join the session you are trying to join.\n\n\nHere are some things you can try to fix the Error Code 264 in Roblox:\n\n\n\nCheck the official Roblox Status page to ensure the servers are not still undergoing issues. If they are, simply wait a little bit before trying again.\n\n\nMake sure your Roblox game files are on the latest version. Simply close Roblox and restart it to force a check for an update.\n\n\nDouble-check your own connection. Check with your ISP to make sure there is no current outage. If you are on a WiFi connection, consider switching to a more stable wired connection.\n\n\nTry another game temporarily. If you are positive that servers are not having issues, try joining another game or session to see if that kicks you out of the previous one, thus fixing Error Code 264 when you try to join a new one.\n\n\n\nThese server-related issues seem to plague Roblox servers every couple of months or so, and are usually resolved within an hour or so. As such, if you've tried all the above fixes and are still having trouble connecting in Roblox, I'd recommend trying again in 30 minutes or so.\n\nThe post How to fix Error Code 264 in Roblox appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're here to guide you through the journey of earning this prestigious title, offering tips and tricks to make the path a little less daunting.\n\n\nHow to unlock Raging Demon title in Blox Fruits\n\n\nPlayers can earn the Raging Demon title by getting 20 player kills in the same server without dying. Your targets must also have a Bounty or Honor on them to count towards the achievement. Otherwise, you'll unlock the Apex Predator instead, which involves defeating 25 players without the Bounty or Honor requirement.\n\n\nIf you're a newcomer to Blox Fruits, you won't be able to access the title until much later. The Title Specialist, a character in the game, can only be found in the Second or Third Seas. These locations can be unlocked after reaching Level 700 or higher. But even with these ranks, you'll still need to improve your character's performance to survive long enough in PvP.\n\n\nImage via Gamer Robot Inc\n\n\nPlayers may need to reach the max level cap level of 2,550 for better chances. It would help if you also took advantage of the fruit powers to reign supreme on the battlefield. Check out our fruits tier list to see which ones are best.\n\n\nOther than fruit, you can set up your build with top-tier weapons and fighting styles. The Legendary Sword Dealer offers some of the best tools to use, boosting your performance substantially. Additionally, fighting styles like Electric Claw or Godhuman can benefit your strategy.\n\n\nRemember, gaining the Raging Demon title in Blox Fruits is not an overnight feat. It requires time, practice, and a lot of patience. If you're just starting out, it's best to save this goal for the later stages of the game.\n\nThe post How to get Raging Demon title in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, most features come at a hefty cost, so it's crucial to farm Gems as much as possible. To help with this, we'll show you a few ways to earn Gems for free in Brawl Stars.\n\n\nBrawl Stars free Gems farming guide\n\n\nYou can get Gems for free in Brawl Stars with the following methods:\n\n\n\nEarned in the Battle Pass\n\n\nClaimable on Supercell Store via Quests\n\n\nSpecial events \n\n\n\nIf you earn enough Battle Pass XP, you'll get to unlock Gems from various tiers. Players can boost their progression from Daily XP, quests, or playing multiple rounds. The free Battle Pass typically features several 10 Gems packs, but you'll need to gather up a ton of points to reach the higher ranks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn addition to the Battle Pass, the Supercell Store provides free Gems based on quest completion rates. Log into your Brawl Stars account on the Supercell page, then look down for the Store Bonuses. You may have already completed some quests, allowing you to claim 10 Gems for free as the first reward. \n\n\nScreenshot via Supercell Store page\n\n\nIf you don't see any claimable rewards, select the 'Quests' section to see what tasks must be completed. The objectives shown here are relatively straightforward, including logging in for a consecutive amount of days or winning battles. Achieve these tasks to earn points for the Bonuses hub. For instance, 750 points offer 25 Gems, one of the most significant free packs.\n\n\nWhile it may require some patience, participating in special events is one of the last options. These celebrations often reward players with free Gems in Brawl Stars, such as the Mega Box gifts from the Classic Brawl. To keep track of these events, stay updated on Brawl Stars' schedule by following their page on Twitter/X.\n\nThe post How to get free Gems in Brawl Stars appeared first on Destructoid.",

As such, those companions are key to everything happening in Veilguard. \nWith such a significant emphasis on these characters, I spoke to some of the game's leads to learn precisely about BioWare's philosophy on companions in Veilguard. \n\n\n\"No, that is the case,\" BioWare general manager Gary McKay tells me when I ask if he agrees with the stumbled-onto-greatness sentiment. \"I would first …",

          "description": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game follow-up to last year’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem animated film, has its first trailer and a release date. The game was first announced last September. \nA Heartful of Games is developing the game, which retains the stylized Spider-Verse-inspired art direction from the hit film. The story unfolds after the movie's events and sees Leo, Raph, Donny, and Mikey battling a new wave of mutants invading New York City. \n\n\nAs previously covered in our exclusive preview earlier this year, Mutant Mayhem is a third-person action/platformer game, and each turtle features a unique playstyle. The game also supports up to two-player local co-op. \nTMNT: Mutants Unleashed launches on October 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also getting a fancy Collector Edition, and you can see the contents of that here. Mutants Unleashed is one of several TMNT games to arrive in recent years (and the third in 2024 alone, following Wrath of the Mutants and the Switch port of Splintered Fate), and you can read all about the franchise’s history in video games in our in-depth retrospective.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke. \nAlthough Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld. \nTakeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.  \n\n\nTakeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review as well as the trailers for previous DLC fighters Homelander, Omni-Man, Ermac, Peacemaker, and Quan-Chi.",

Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game's trailer shouts \"exploding knife!\" when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess.

It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.\nStarting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:\n    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.\n    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.\n    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.\nAlso, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”\nLike the original, Monaco 2 is a game about pulling of…",

In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.\nFor some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. \nWe have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?
