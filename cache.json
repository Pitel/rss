Except we were.\nThe first game delivered some harmless fun when the Switch was all fresh and new. It showcased some of the cool features that the console promised and filled a gap when there weren't all that many games available. But now, six years on and with enough games available to keep us going until the end of time, we couldn't help but wonder: do we really need a sequel any more?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The quick brown deer jumped over the lazy owl.\nSome people can't help but translate things. We see languages, and we want to decipher them, like the people who climb Mount Everest just because it's there. The languages in games like FEZ, Titan Souls, Heaven's Vault, 7 Days To End With You, and Noita, invite the player to try to crack them to reveal more of the game's lore, and players are often rewarded for doing so, even if it's usually just extra story. Translating the Fez language was literally the first thing I did, and it basically revealed the whole plot of the game before I'd even started. Oops!\nBut those game examples are all made on indie budgets. What happens when a gigantic, multi-billion-dollar company like Nintendo makes its own language? The answer is that we get THREE languages. The Zelda series has Hylian, Sheikah, and as of Tears of the Kingdom, Zonai — three languages that look very different and were designed to represent the culture of each of their races.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Not enough reason to spend more time with Rabbids.\nTo the surprise of pretty much everyone, the original Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle became one of the best tactics games on the Nintendo Switch. We loved its tight, puzzle-like missions and vibrant world that somehow presented Ubisoft’s Rabbids as less-than-annoying – even, dare we say, sometimes endearing. The sequel followed suit, impressing critics and fans alike with a handful of great planets to explore, though we preferred the tight gameplay of the first over the creative freedom of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.\nOne area where Kingdom Battle excelled was its Donkey Kong Adventure DLC. Completely separate from the campaign, it saw Rabbid Peach teaming up with Donkey and Cranky Kong to take on a Rabbid threat, resplendent with an overwhelming amount of nostalgic Donkey Kong Country references. To say we have high hopes for Sparks of Hope’s DLC is an understatement, and unfortunately, the first major DLC – following the season pass-exclusive update The Tower of Doooom – fails to reach the same heights despite being a fun little addition to the base game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We knew the game was real and that it would come to Switch in 2023. That was just about all of the information that we got at the time, but it was a start.

Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. \nTwo or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs. \nRead more",

Seeing all the great demos this week has made me far more excited about the future of video games than any of the notE3 streams did the other week, and I'm not gonna lie, a large part of my excitement stems from the brilliant Let's! Revolution!, a beautifully animated tile-based roguelite that has a touch of Minesweeper about it. I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn't enough to really get across just how excellent this is. So indulge me a bit while I tell you more about it.  \nRead more",

That's the journey I've been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.  \nRead more",

Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. \nHere’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you're working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.\nRead more",

It's really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn't so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won't let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.\nRead more",

I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess?

Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations. \nRead more",

I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.\r\n\n\r\nMy poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to \"really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we're telling\", and he hopes that the way they've characterised the campaign's principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.\nRead more",

It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here.

Guns have punch, stomps have oomph, reward boxes have merry jingles. It's a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. \nIt left early access 11 days ago, which is 11 days you could have spent splatting crustaceans and wasps with skeleton trombones and deadly finger guns. \n\n \nRead more",

Sure, you might not want to play Company Of Heroes 3 specifically with said controller, but controllers in general are useful things that we at RPS use a lot for playing other types of games, and hey, we thought you might want to know about it, just in case. You can enter here if you fancy your chances.  \nRead more",

Did 2020's summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It's probably a horror game set in space. Doesn't that look great? Now let's take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.\r\n\n\r\nYep, that's right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I've commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

          "description": "Could this be related to Separate Ways?\nThe hype for the remake of Resident Evil 4 may have died down, but it's still out there as one of the best horror games of the year. Upon release back in March, it sold millions in quick succession, showing Capcom was onto another winner.\nIn the interim, a lot of you have been waiting for the game's first major DLC, Separate Ways, which would be a remake of the content from the original RE4. We don't yet know when it's coming out, but eagle-eyed gamers think the developer is preparing for its launch.\nOver on SteamDB (as spotted by Twitter user and known leaker Wario64), a website that tracks all things related to Steam, it looks as though Resident Evil 4 is getting seven new achievements added to the game. There are no details on what these achievements actually are as they're marked as hidden, but some speculate they could be related to the DLC.\nhttps://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1673334239352311814\nOther theories suggest it could be in relation to the VR version of the Resident Evil 4 remake. All of these are, of course, speculations. Hopefully, Capcom will give further details at some point. In any case, it's something to keep a close eye on. It looks as though RE4 is preparing for a new patch, but we can't be sure of the details at this stage. We know Separate Ways is inbound, but these new Steam achievements suggest that it could be arriving sooner than anticipated.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 gets new Steam achievements, suggests inbound DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game is essentially a standalone variant of the Pokémon-like Temtem that released out of early access last year. You do not need to purchase the previous Temtem game in order to access Temtem: Showdown.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388841\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Humble Games[/caption]\nGotta battle em' all!\nTemtem: Showdown takes out the taming and leveling from the base game, and focuses purely on the combat. Dubbed a \"free multiplayer battle simulator\", players can build a team in seconds and dash into ranked matches with players from all over the world. At its core, Temtem's battle system features action-packed 2v2 battles. It'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a bit of doubles in online Pokémon matches.\nCompetitive play seems to be a huge part of the game, featuring a climbable ranked ladder system. Furthermore, the game will have community-run tournaments as well as an official esports circuit called TemCS. According to to the Steam page, the circuit will reward huge prizes.\nSeasons will also be a thing in Temtem: Showdown. There will be a new season every few months, changing up the meta and introducing new combinations to play with when doing battle.\nI haven't got a chance to play Temtem yet, though it's in my backlog to play on PS5. I have heard great things about its battle system though, so this seems like the right idea to make it accessible to more players. While Temtem is available on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, it looks like Temtem: Showdown is only available via Steam for now.\nIf you want to give the game a try, you can check out Temtem: Showdown now for free on Steam.\nThe post Temtem: Showdown is a free, battle-focused Temtem game out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

Microsoft has just added both the Chevrolet Corvette that Barbie drives in the movie, as well as Ken's GMC HUMMER EV Pickup to Forza Horizon 5's drivable roster.\nMicrosoft has said that to get them both, all players have to do is check their Forza Horizon 5 message center. Everything for free, no paid DLC. Just get the cars and let's go party.\nhttps://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1673360575706066945\nSome could have jumped at the opportunity to complain that they wanted *insert name of edgy, bat-themed vehicle here* and not this. But the Chevrolet is no slouch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_RsVstmcls\nAnd it looks pretty damn good in photo mode.\nhttps://twitter.com/JewelsVEVO/status/1673361123352129536?s=20\nAnyone who's not into giving Barbie's preferred ride a chance can go with the much more aggressive HUMMER Pickup.\nhttps://youtu.be/wN7qCE4uI_s\n \nAs the unexpectedly great box-office war of Barbie vs Oppenheimer draws ever nearer, Barbie reveals she has no trouble fighting on the most unexpected of fronts. Is this how Greta Gerwig's live-action take on the popular doll will take down Christopher Nolan's three-hour-long wartime drama? Will Fortnite soon host an event showing the horrendous effects of nuclear weapons as Nolan tries to win the gamer populace back? Only time will tell. Oppenheimer opens in theatres on July 20. Barbie catches up to him in her Chevy just one day later, on July 21.\nAs for the Forza Horizon 5 cars, you can download those right now.\nThe post It’s a Barbie world in Forza Horizon 5 with new car update appeared first on Destructoid.",

I will never understand the appeal of centering an entire property around a character deliberately created to be annoying. He’s like Bugs Bunny, except you never feel the need to root for him. No, he’s more like Batman’s Joker, but you replace all the charisma with just a second heaping of insane malice. I hate him so much.\nSo, I bought a game that headlines him. It’s 2000’s Woody Woodpecker Racing for PS1 and Windows. I bought this specifically so I could remind my brain that it’s trapped here in this hell with me.

Announced during the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, Sand Land is an interesting pick for an ILCA-developed, Bandai Namco-published action-RPG adaptation.\nWhile many in the west are familiar with Akira Toriyama's work, Sand Land isn't quite as popular as, say, Dragon Ball. But that relative disparity is what made Sand Land interesting to me. I've seen tons of Dragon Ball. I don't know much about Sand Land. And after playing a little bit of the latter at Summer Game Fest 2023, I'm curious to see even more of its Mad Max-like arid wastes.\nFor those unfamiliar, Sand Land is a single-volume manga from Toriyama set in a world with little water.

Pre-orders are now open for limited edition Oreo x Super Mario cookies. And I don’t know how I can remain shocked that this is where the FOMO market has gotten us.\nA pack of Orea x Super Mario includes 12 cookies, and there are 16 designs in all. Of the 16 embossed designs, one of them features Luigi, and none of them depicts Monty Mole. If you eat the entire package by yourself, you’ll be treating yourself to 720 calories and immeasurable shame.\nOreos are also challenging you to balance the allegedly rare Bowser cookie on the edge of a glass and then stack all the other characters on top of it until it all collapses. I guess this is a social media thing. No prize has been announced, but they say, \"The Oreo brand may even have a surprise in store for fans who rise to the challenge, defeat Bowser and save the Mushroom Kingdom.\" Oh, gosh, there's a trailer on the site.\nHuh. Oreos definitely aren’t bad cookies, and I have no problems with product marketing. This just seems a bit extra. Preorders for a Cookie? Maybe this is normal, and I'm the one who's out of touch. It reminds me of the Super Mario Cereal, where the box was also an Amiibo. I still have never seen a physical box of that stuff. It disappeared the moment it hit the shelf. Even still, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it.\nIf you do want to pre-order some cookies, there’s a limit of 1 per order. That means your pre-order can’t possibly net you all 16 designs. Weird. However, they will appear in stores like any normal cookie. Their release into the world begins on July 10, 2023.\nThe post You can pre-order your limited edition Mario Oreos appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, for those of you who have yet to play it, now seems like a good time, as it's currently on offer for ridiculously cheap. With Starfield still a few months away, you might want something to do until then. And let's face it, we've all pretty much had our fill of Skyrim.\nSo how much is Fallout 4 at the moment? Head on over to the Steam page and you'll see that you can pick up the vanilla copy of the game for $6.59 (or £5.27 for our British readers). That's a pretty magnificent 67% off the usual price. But it doesn't end there, either.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388625\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]\nSay you fancy \"going big\" and you want the Game of the Year edition. Well, that too is on sale, now priced at $9.99 (or £8.74). The GOTY version of Fallout 4 comes with all the official expansions, including Far Harbor and Nuka-World.\nYou'll need to be a little quick though if you want to take advantage of the promotion, as it ends on June 29. That still gives you a few days to make a purchase, but it's not going to be around for long.\nBut let's say you don't fancy playing Fallout 4. Maybe you've already got a copy of it and you've been playing it to death since 2015. Well, you might be interested in hearing about the Fallout: London. This is a fan project that, as the name suggests, tells a F4 story in England's capital city. The DLC-sized mod is loaded with custom content and is expected to release sometime in 2023, so keep an eye out for that.\nThe post While you wait for Starfield, you can pick up Fallout 4 for dirt cheap appeared first on Destructoid.",

The fan-made modification takes TES4 and rebuilds it in TES5's engine, and the scope of this project is one for the ages. Now, the volunteers working on this unofficial remake has shared a new video that shows the current progress plus what's left to do.\nThe 10-minute footage over on YouTube is essentially a checklist of how much has been done on Skyblivion since work began in 2012. While there's still a way to go, So far the team has managed to map around 82% of Oblivion's world. On top of that, roughly 40% of the interiors have been done, a third of the \"meshing\" is now complete, and nearly 100 quests are described as \"playable\".\nhttps://youtu.be/H1q1nXLDjB8\nThe video also shows how much is still left, with a staggering amount of work still ahead for the modders. They're also calling out for additional help, so if you feel you have the skills and want to contribute towards Skyblivion's success, you can become a volunteer.\nThe team also recently celebrated eight years of continuous work that's gone into the project. As it stands, the fan remake is due to release sometime in 2025, so there are still a couple more years to go. The best thing about it is it'll be completely free.

          "description": "Back on the shores of hell\nIn 2020, Nightdive Studios released a source port of the oft-forgotten Doom 64 that brought it to modern platforms and reintroduced it to a new, more receptive audience. Beyond simply porting it, however, they added a new episode that better links it to the rest of the Doom series narrative. Now fans have implemented the new episode back into the N64 version as Doom 64: Complete Edition.\nThis means that if you, for whatever reason (not judging), preferred the N64 version of Doom 64, you can play it again without sacrificing the extra features of Nightdive Studios’ source port. This all sounds really difficult, since the 2020 version runs on Nightdive’s proprietary Kex Engine. I’m assuming the maps still exist in an extractable format because I imagine it would be too much work to try to manually recreate them for a release such as this.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388694\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via MobyGames[/caption]\nBeyond simply adding the extra maps, Doom 64: Complete Edition adds a number of quality-of-life upgrades. You can find them at this link. One of the most important revisions for me, however, is the ability to disable three-point texture filtering. This was what was mostly to blame for everything on the N64 looking blurry. They also improved the framerate in some areas and enabled support for the Expansion Pak upgrade. That’s some good stuff!\nIf you haven’t played Doom 64, it’s definitely worth checking out. It always had its fans, but Nightdive’s port helped force a wider re-assessment of Midway’s contribution to the series. Personally, I don’t think it’s better than Doom, but I might put it above Doom 2. However, it has its own style and approach to the series’ formula.\nThe Doom 64: Complete Edition fan patch can be found here.\nThe post Doom 64 fan mod adds Nightdive’s new episode to N64 version appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yep, only one of the games in the \"trilogy\" will be included physically, and you'll need to download the rest. Don't just take it from me, read the entire FAQ entry on the game's official site:\nDoes the Nintendo Switch physical version of Batman: Arkham Trilogy include all three games on one cartridge?\nBatman: Arkham Asylum will be included on the Batman: Arkham Trilogy game cartridge. Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight will require an online connection to download and install both titles when the Batman: Arkham Trilogy cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console. All three games will then be playable as long as the cartridge is inserted into the Nintendo Switch console.\n\nWelp! At least you get \"all previously released DLC\" with that download when it comes out this fall!\nThis is part of a longer trend for third-party games\nAlthough The Witcher 3 managed to cram the game on a higher-capacity cart, many third-party Switch games have suffered the same fate as the Arkham Trilogy.

As such, it could mean that the long-awaited Bethesda RPG is actually on deck for gaming's next generation.\nhttps://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1672314548995366935\nAccording to a recent report from The Verge, Spencer did say in a 2021 interview that it will be exclusive to Xbox, though it doesn't necessarily mean it will be this generation's Xbox. When questioned about this today, the executive doesn't recall ever making such a statement. And so, it stands, we're not really any closer to understanding what's happening with the next Elder Scrolls installment. A couple of years ago, Todd Howard said the game was still in early development.\nAll we can really hope is that once Starfield is released this September, then Bethesda will be willing to spill a few more beans. We can assume that, for now, the studio is just keeping its cards close to its chest.\nThe post The Elder Scrolls 6 could still be ‘five-plus’ years away appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Detective Pikachu Returns, and Mario RPG are at the top\nA little less than a week ago, Nintendo once again showed us the staying power of the Direct, and gave us a ton of announcements and a few surprise releases. We have a full recap here, but if you're a visual learner, Nintendo recently tweeted out a full infographic of what was announced or reconfirmed; with the first-party cream rising to the top.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388663\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nIf I had to guess what would win a \"most excited\" poll, it would be Mario RPG\nI'm still cautiously optimistic about Super Mario Bros. Wonder (I hope the gimmicks are more than skin-deep), but based on the almost universally-positive reaction to the Super Mario RPG revival, I'd say that takes the highest hype spot. I mean, it's at the top of my list too! Re-releasing Pikmin 1 and 2 was a genius move as well, as you can get the entire mainline Pikmin series on one platform now. That's kind of become a calling card for the Nintendo Switch: a successor to the 3DS in its own right, collecting both old, new, and new-again games in one spot.\nAs for Detective Pikachu Returns, it's in a super weird spot. We're years removed from the film, and I'm the only person I know who actually played the original Detective Pikachu from start to finish. It'll be interesting to see how the game performs, and if it gets another gigantic amiibo.\nThe post Here are all the recent Nintendo Direct games coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Battle Beyond the Stars\nBethesda has confirmed that the \"Constellation Edition\" of its upcoming space opera Starfield will not contain an actual disc of the game itself, and will instead feature a download code for the chosen platform. The publisher noted this controversial development in a tweet from its support team.\n\"Hello!\" said the team, responding directly to a fan's question. \"All physical editions include a code for the chosen platform. There are no physical discs\". The tweet has since been deleted from Twitter.\nThe community understandably responded unhappily to the news, with some decrying the return of \"non-physical physical editions\", while others pointed to the continued slant toward a future where archiving games becomes a much-more-difficult venture without hard copies of the games themselves. The response was overwhelmingly negative, with some, (some as Twitter's Wario64), pointing out that certain adverts for Starfield's physical release had clearly stated that a disc was included.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYEiTdsyas\nThe removal of the initial tweet suggested that there were crossed wires somewhere along the chain of communication. And that indeed proved to be the case, as it now seems that while the standard edition of Starfield will feature a physical disc including game code, it is purely the $250 Constellation Edition that will not — a digital download code for the title being issued as part of this version. And so, anybody who wishes to pick up the Collector's Edition and own a physical disc of the sci-fi spectacle will, at this stage, be required to pick up both versions.\nStarfield launches September 6 on PC and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post Starfield collector’s edition will not include an actual disc appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "But the Blessed Mother returned\nBlizzard Entertainment was hit with a huge DDOS attack this weekend, which ensured that several titles, including recent release Diablo 4, were offline and unplayable for an extended period of time. The DDOS attack has since passed, and the dungeon-crawling sequel is, as of this writing, fully playable once again.\nWhile players started noticing issues late Saturday, the attack was first noted by the studio itself on the morning of Sunday, when a brief message posted to Twitter said that the team was \"currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers\". Players had noticed that they were unable to log in to titles such as Diablo 4 and World of Warcraft during this time. The studio then confirmed that it was undergoing a DDOS attack, wherein parties intently overrun a server with requests, causing an information lockup or even a full collapse.\nhttps://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1673082677115666440?s=20\nLater that day, Blizzard announced that the attack had ended and that normal service had been resumed. The DDOS attack effectively lasted less than a day but, given that it was Sunday, it no doubt cut into some valuable playing time for those who are only able to delve into Blizzard's worlds during the weekend hours. Malicious DDOS attacks remain a problem for online communities, whether targeted at specific websites or full gaming networks and streaming services.\nDiablo 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Blizzard DDOS attack brought down Diablo 4 this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Curse the bricks on the hedgehog\nDuring the third annual Sonic Central, Sega has announced that LEGO Sonic will be playable in the DLC for the upcoming Sonic Superstars. Even beyond that, if you pre-order Sonic Superstars, you’ll also get the ability to transform Robotnik into LEGO Eggman. Leggman!\nThat’s about it. Uh, here’s a trailer.\nhttps://youtu.be/qi8zAunO9xw\nThat was fun! As you can see, it does everything I told you. Sonic the Hedgehog is replaced by the LEGO minifig of the classic ‘90s veteran. I’m not sure how accurate this is to what the DLC will be like, but I’m hoping that Robotnik will always appear like that if you use the skin.\nIt’s really classy for Sega to announce both DLC and pre-order bonuses right together. Classic Sega. This seems like not a lot for DLC. Will we see LEGO minifigs of the other characters? I’m guessing no, but you never know.\nSonic Superstars is, of course, the upcoming classic-styled sidescroller with four-player co-op. I’m looking forward to it, but I keep getting flashbacks to the co-op in the Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games. It was so awful to whoever was stuck as Tails. When my husband and I were first dating, he was really excited to find out that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has co-op. I tried to check his expectations, but even then, he was extremely disappointed when we finally sat down to play it. It’s only slightly better than handing your sibling an unplugged controller so they can pretend to play along.\nSonic Superstars is going to be released sometime later this year for PS4/PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC. Not sure about the LEGO Sonic DLC, but with Leggman being a pre-order bonus, it sounds like it will be released alongside the game.\nThe post LEGO Sonic and Robotnik are coming to Sonic Superstars appeared first on Destructoid.",

Take the recent changes to revenue splits. Some felt that this was a step in the right direction, but given that the new program comes with a bunch of boxes that need to be ticked, not everyone can benefit.\nNow, there's a new feature that's being implemented, which could also be seen in a less-than-good light for most. According to a recent blog post, Twitch is introducing \"Hype Chat,\" a feature that gives viewers the chance to literally buy chat messages. The idea behind it is to let users \"stand out\" in the overall chat.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388337\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"572\"] Image via Twitch.[/caption]\nAmounts that can be paid for messages vary from $1 to $500 (though Twitch says that streamers can set a minimum amount up to $100). Depending on how much a viewer pays will depend on the duration of the pinned comment, as well as character length, and the visual design. All this while affording the person streaming the ability to \"earn a share of the revenue from each Hype Chat purchase.\"\nBut, as usual, not everyone will get the benefit of this new feature. The blog post goes on to say that Hype Chat is only available to Partners, so smaller channels will miss out. However, the Amazon-owned service does say that it may look into implementing this \"more broadly\" in the future.\nFor some, though, it may be too little too late to win back support. With big streaming names like xQc and Amouranth already jumping ship to rival platform Kick, things are looking a bit tough for Twitch right now, though it should be noted that it is still pulling in millions of users each month.\nThe post Twitch introduces ‘Hype Chat,’ where you can pay money to pin your messages appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not a big buffet, but it does feature New Game Plus, which I’m surprised it took this long to be added.\nOn top of New Game Plus, Sonic Frontiers is getting some goofy cosmetics, a special collectible Koco, new moves, and some new challenges. That’s all pretty groovy, but I don’t know what else to really say about them.\nhttps://youtu.be/vAB_BG60APA\nNew Game Plus, I can certainly understand the value of. Sonic builds up his skills throughout the game. This will allow you to start over with all of those intact and just completely wreck house with a combination of too much power and experience. Both your skill tree and power-ups will carry over.\nI should probably go back and finish Sonic Frontiers. I played it pre-release and fell off at maybe the 10-hour mark. I was covering it for guides, and everything in that game has its own dedicated tutorial. I also feel like, while I like Sonic the Hedgehog games (some of them), I have to be in a very specific mood to play them, and I’m kind of feeling that right now.\nThe Birthday Bash update is completely free to anyone who owns Sonic Frontiers, and is dropping today at 5:00 pm PST. If you don’t, it’s available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers gets New Game Plus as part of a Birthday Bash update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not Forgotten\nGuerilla Games has created a memorial within Horizon Forbidden West to Lance Reddick, who recently died on March 17, 2023. Reddick voiced Sylens in both the core game and its expansion, Burning Shores. This is as well as appearing in 2017’s Horizon: Zero Dawn.\nThe memorial for Reddick can be found within the Burning Shores expansion on the island where you first meet Seyka. If you start off on the area to the North of that island using a campfire on the beach (near the lava flow), you can fly directly south, across the straight, and onto a ridge. You might find it easiest to spot at night because the memorial itself is a bright blue hologram.\nhttps://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1672213285712584704?s=20\nBeyond memorable roles in film, such as Charon in the John Wick series, Reddick has been a voice in video games since 2009’s 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand. He had a prominent role in the Destiny series. After news of his death, Destiny 2 players gathered to pay respect.\nThe memorial is part of the latest update for Horizon: Forbidden West, and demonstrates how well-respected Lance Reddick was among those he worked with.\nHorizon: Forbidden West and its Burning Shores expansion is available on PlayStation 5.\nThe post Memorial to Lance Reddick added to Horizon: Burning Shores appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailer then cuts to new footage of the game, which you can check out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Baker says he joined Fort Solis because it allowed him to work alongside Clark (whom you might recognize as Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2) and because he liked the story as well. As for the new Fort Solis footage, it shows more of the spooky Martian horror featured in the game. In it, Clark’s character, Jack Leary, tries to survive “through one long and terrifying night on Mars.” Leary appears to be guided, in some way, by Baker’s Wyatt Taylor and Julia Brown’s character, Jessica Appleton. \nFort Solis hits PlayStation 5 and PC on August 22. \nFor more, check out the Fort Solis reveal trailer from last year.\nAre you playing Fort Solis this August?

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

          "description": "We’ve all been there. You’re playing a game you really like; the action is tight, the visuals are impressive, and the systems are engaging. Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. \nLocalization and translation are difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region. Another contributing complexity is the way that language, facial expressions, and…",

Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. \nThe remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

          "description": "When The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrived on May 12, its launch was accompanied by an Amiibo of Link. But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises \"valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider.\" \nThe Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here. For a funny take on the poses Game Informer's Kyle Hilliard wishes the Tears of the Kingdom Link took instead, head here.",

This brand-new adventure sports a revamped art style (and more expressive characters) and stars the familiar foursome of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad in addition to Daisy and Yoshi.\n\n\nThe 2D worlds sport trippy features caused by a new power-up called the Wonder Flower. This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous. \nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.",

From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.\n\n\nThe main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.\nYou'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.\nFinally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.\nIf you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.",

Knocking enemies down opens up the “One More” action to double up damage. The game also encourages canny positioning choices, since surrounding your foes with three characters opens up the “Triple Threat” ability to deal big damage.\nDrawing from the capability seen in Persona 5, you can also fuse Personas to create new ones.\nPersona 5 Tactica is coming to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as Switch, on November 17.",

Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.\n\n\nTitled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.\nThe first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.\nWhile the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.\nNo specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.",

The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.\nYou can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.\nAs you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.\nThe recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.\nFor more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here.

          "description": "By most measures, From Software's success is a surprise. Not because it makes bad games; time has proven it makes some of the greatest games of all time. But because it makes incredibly difficult, obtuse games, such as the Soulsborne titles, defined by their challenge and willingness to go against common game design philosophies. From Software reached a critical and commercial apex in 2022 when it released Elden Ring, its most popular game to date by a large margin. And now that it's become a household name in the gaming world, the studio is going back to its roots.\nEarly in June, we flew out to Tokyo, Japan, to visit From Software to be the first people in the world to see Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon.

Instead, it took nine. \nInitially revealed on stage during Sony's 2014 E3 press conference, Dead Island 2 had an infamously rocky road to release. What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry. Its publisher, Deep Silver, spent many of those years saying little to nothing about the game other than vague confirmations that it was still in development. Until it resurfaced in late 2022, a seeming sign that Dead Island 2 would see the light of day – which i…",

          "description": "Last December, Deadline reported that a Death Stranding movie was in the works. Kojima Productions, the studio that made the original game, was set to be one of two main producers, but there was no word on who would write, direct, or star in the film, or if any members of the original creative team would occupy any of those roles. Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.\nJust to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\nJune 18, 2023\nHere, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be \"deeply involved\" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will \"introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe,\" according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.\nIn addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:\nGiven the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.",

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
