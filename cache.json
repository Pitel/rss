It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad \"paintress\" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse.

Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance.

Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

A city-building game that takes place on small, post-apocalyptic islands, where the only way to expand is upward.\n\"Playing Jenga with human lives\" is how they summarise it, the wastrels.

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.\nMy Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. \"Sink or swim!\" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.\nRead more",

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Looks like Sony have caught the live service jitters. The company have cancelled two online multiplayer games, including one based on God Of War, according to a report by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier. Two different Sony-owned studios were recently told to stop development on their projects. One of those studios is Bluepoint, known for their work on the Demon's Souls remake. They were making the unannounced live service God Of War game, according to Schreier. The other studio is Bend, developers of open world zombie 'em up Days Gone. We don't know what they were working on, aside from the fact it was also to have a live service business model. In any case, both have been canned. \nRead more",

But now shit just works!\"\nYou might know Sam Prebble as Trigger Happy Interactive, the solo developer behind frenetic FPS Turbo Overkill. Before that he went by a different name, attached to a very different project. Total Chaos, first released in 2018 under the moniker Wadaholic, is a total conversion mod for Doom 2. With its focus on a thick survival horror atmosphere of tension and disempowerment, it's about as far removed from Turbo Overkill's manic, Doom Eternal-inspired action as a game can get. As Prebble puts it, the only thing the two projects have in common is the first person perspective. Even so, he found himself returning to Total Chaos after wrapping development on Turbo Overkill, resulting in the standalone remake. \nRead more",

Deriding a good cheap scare ignores the endorphin rush that draws so many players to the genre, in the same way that the \"elevated horror\" trend forfeits some of the soul of schlocky slasher flicks and ghost movies. Don’t get me wrong, Silent Hill and Alan Wake deserve their flowers - but even those games would wither on the screen if Pyramid Head didn’t bust through a wall from time to time.\nOne unsung jump scare game in particular pioneered horror in the internet age, blazing everywhere from nascent social media to major television networks. In fact, if you had an internet connection circa 2005, there’s a good chance you played it. Alas, it was too ahead of its time, too successful at leveraging virality before viral horror was sought after.

Maybe, um, God? \r\n\n\r\nIt’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game Obliterate Everything by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL.

Finally, a game brave enough to ask: \"what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?\".\nIt's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Kraken Pool might be the last location you can access on Fisch's Atlantis Island, but it can be the most valuable one to visit.\n\n\nYou'll have to gain access to all other regions of Atlantis before you can enter the Kraken Pool. Like all other regions, you'll need to solve certain puzzles to enter the Pool. Doing so is pretty important if you want to get the Kraken Rod, and catch the Kraken.\n\n\nHow to unlock Kraken Pool in Fisch\n\n\nTo gain access to Kraken Pool, you'll have to solve the Mythological Clock Wheel puzzle across different regions. You'll find the clocks in different locations, including one at Kraken Pool, and each has a unique solution.\n\n\nAll Mythological Clock Wheel solutions in Fisch\n\n\nYou'll find the Mythological Clocks at the following locations: Sunken Depths, Ethereal Abyss, Poseidon Temple, and Zeus Trial (before coming across the final one at Kraken Pool). Here's the solution for all the puzzles. You'll have to select the correct choice at every region to solve the complete Clock Wheel puzzle.\n\n\n\nSunken Depths (-4606, -594, 1843): Blue Harp\n\n\nEthereal Abyss (-4107, -603, 1823): Orange Helmet\n\n\nPoseidon Temple (-4299, -604, 1587): Black Scythe\n\n\nZeus Trial (-4295, -583, 2021): Purple Moon\n\n\nKraken Pool (-4295, -991, 1792): Red Spear\n\n\n\nOnce you solve the final Clock Wheel puzzle, the door will open, giving you access to Kraken Pool.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Kraken Rod in Fisch\n\n\nOnce you gain access, you'll find the fishing location, which is the only place you can find the Kraken. You can also purchase the Kraken Rod from this location. It's certainly one of the best rods that have been added to Fisch, and you can buy it for C$1,333,333. Credits-wise, it's the third-most expensive rod to get as part of the Atlantis update.\n\nThe post How to open and unlock the Kraken Pool in Fisch: Location, Clock Puzzle Solutions appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll need to use the TNT to reach Zeus' Heart, which is required to enter Atlantis. Let's take a look at all five Forsaken Shore locations, which will allow you to spawn TNT and essentially grant you access to Atlantis.\n\n\nAll Forsaken Shore Lever locations in Fisch\n\n\nThe Forsaken Shore Island is host to all five levers, but they're spread across different locations. Here's how you can find all of them on the island.\n\n\nLever\nGPS\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nLever 1\n-2252, 140, 1591\nThe first one can be found next to the Merchant. The lever is located on the wall to the right of where the Merchant is standing.\n\n\nLever 2\n-2568, 149, 1644\nThis lever can be found near the Forsaken Skin merchant. There's a stone wall located behind him, and the lever is attached to it. \n\n\nLever 3\n-2837, 132, 1508\nThe third one is located at the Waterfall. Go through it, and you'll find the lever. \n\n\nLever 4\n-2729, 169, 1730\nThe fourth one is attached to a wooden bridge on top of the Forsaken Shores mountains. \n\n\nLever 5\n-2282, 316, 1607\nTo find the fifth one, you'll have to go to the leaderboard next to the river. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you pull all five levers, go to the Atlantis area in the Grand Reef location. The location is close to where the Pirate NPC is located. Once you blast the door using TNT, you'll be able to teleport to the new Atlantis Island.\n\n\nYou'll have 59 different fishes to catch in this region. Additionally, you can also add up to seven new rods to add to your collection.

Mělo to mít nějakou jinou \"message\" než \"když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš\"? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
