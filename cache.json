In stark contrast to the Wii U days when even established developers had trouble getting their games on Nintendo platforms, the weekly update is now filled with games that would have been unthinkable just one console generation ago.\nFor all my moaning to come, I'll make it clear up front that I'm not advocating going back to those dark days - the breadth and quantity of experiences you can download from the eShop is one of the great strides forward Nintendo made this gen.

Mobile gaming has fallen by the wayside (somewhat - though Nintendo properties have also dipped their toes in the water here), and, we now have a bevvy of powerful handheld consoles to choose from, including the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally X, the Lenovo Legion Go, and many more.

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine.

The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.\nI’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

The latest to do so is ‘brinepunk’ FPS Abyssus, which seems to have mostly arrived at the terms by being ‘a bit Steampunk, but underwater’.

If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.\nCairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty.

From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this?

They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

It's got Subnautica's core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. \nHow many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe?

If, however, you’re hoping to switch to the 9800X3D from an older system with DDR4 RAM, you’ll need to upgrade that as well as the motherboard, as the entire Ryzen 9000 series only works with newer DDR5 memory.\nCyber Monday won’t help materialise more processors into retailers’ warehouses, but it can help you make this RAM switch on the cheap. Relatively speaking. And I can recommend a nice, fast 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance DDR5, which is down by £43 in the UK and $22 in the US.\nRead more",

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world.

Glancing over that map as a newcomer to the game, my eye was caught by the creator's casual mention that Caves Of Qud is technically 2,147,483,646 levels deep.\n\"Is Caves Of Qud really 2,147,483,646 levels deep?\" I asked Brendy, like a wide-eyed child asking whether there is such a thing as dog heaven.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion. One game that’s already taken this scanned bricolage concept and run with it to beautiful effect is Hyperdrive Inn. It’s an avant garde point and click adventure from Finnish studio Horsefly, where the entire world is constructed from scanned fabric samples. Have a looksee.\nRead more",

It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.\nRead more",

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.\r\n\nAll of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It's currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where \"all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible.\" Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.\n$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.\nRead more",

The orthodox interpretation is that \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a \"shotgun\" instead of the \"scissors\". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!\nThe sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists.

Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well.

V jeho rámci lze distribuovat vlastní obrazy jako tarball, Appx či skrze Windows Store, nicméně dříve byl problém s příliš restriktivní licencí Microsoftu (nutnost souhlasit s podmínkami obchodu a „podepsat“ vývojářský souhlas). To v současných verzích WSL2 už neplatí, Jeremy konstatuje, že s WSL 2.4.4 a vyššími je usnadněna distribuce vlastních obrazů mimo obchod Microsoftu.",

After progressing through the area, the Fascists will find the tomb and you have to sneak out. However, as you reach the exit, you may not know just how to exit the Catacombs down in the Necropolis in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to Exit the Catacombs and Open the Gate\n\n\nWhether you sneak past the Fascists or choose to take them out directly via combat, you'll eventually reach a closed gate with the quest objective to Exit the Catacombs. If you look at your quest marker indicator, it will show that you need to exit via the closed gate, but there's no indication of how to do so. While most locked doors or gates will tell you how to open them when you interact with them—such as saying it's locked from the other side or requires a key—this gate offers no such information.\n\n\nLook around this room and you will find a big Roman-style head and torso bust of a man wearing a toga. You have probably encountered these in various places and wondered their purpose. Before now, the only use of them has been to slam over someone's head to take them out.\n\n\nHowever, to Exit the Catacombs, you need to pick up the bust and place it on the pedestal located to the left of the Catacombs Gate. As long as you pick up the bust and then approach the pedestal, it will give you the option to interact with it to place the bust on top of the pedestal. Putting the bust on the pedestal will open the gate and allow you to finally Exit the Catacombs.\n\n\n\nThe post How to Exit the Catacombs in the Necropolis in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle appeared first on Destructoid.",

But don't worry; we're here to explain what the Stamp does in BO6 Zombies and how to get it.\n\n\nHow to get and use Stamps in BO6 Zombies\n\n\nYou can get Stamps by shooting a zombie with a bucket on its head around or after Round 10. Mine appeared near the Dead Shot Daquiri building, but it does spawn in random places, too. After you've acquired the Stamp, use it on the knights to claim a sword. This is tied to the build for the elemental swords, the newest Wonder Weapon featured in Citadelle de Morts. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can find four knights in the top-right room inside the castle, specifically at coordinates F1. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nEach Knight corresponds to the element it harnesses, featuring a symbol on the statue. For example, you can spot a lion on a Knight, indicating that it's designated for the Solaris: Lion of Light builds. Here's a look into what each statue gives you:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you approach the statue, simply press the Interact button (same as Reload) next to the Knight, and you'll get a Bastard Sword. It'll replace your Melee Weapon, allowing you to slice up zombies. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, if you're looking for the elemental sword, you'll need to buff this bad boy out to unlock its hidden powers. There are also different steps to unlock each one, including Dragon's Fire, Stag of Storms, Raven's Shadow, and Lion of Light. The procedure functions similarly to Zombies Origins' Fire, Lightning, Ice, and Wind Staffs.

          "description": "Limestone is a critical material you need to obtain to get Midhaven up and running in Towers of Aghasba, but getting it isn't exactly obvious. So, here's where you can find all the Limestone you need.\n\n\nHow to get Limestone in Towers of Aghasba\n\n\nOne of the first objectives you're given upon reaching Midhaven is to build a Lumber Mill within the village limits. You're required to acquire several standard materials for the Lumber Mill, but one of the main materials, Limestone, is a mystery if you're just getting to this point in the game.\n\n\nIf you take a look at the location hint in-game, the tooltip states that you can find Limestone around mountains and cliffs but gives no other relevant information. I had trouble finding this material myself, mainly because I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Turns out, it is the next tier of Stone in Towers of Aghasba, and that means that it comes from a specific type of boulder: a Limestone Boulder.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nLimestone Boulders look very similar to normal Boulders, but, when harvested, yield various amounts of Limestone for crafting. They cannot be found on Amani Island like regular Stone. Instead, they is quite prevalent around the mainland of Aghasba. There is some relevant truth in the tooltip's explanation as Limestone is indeed most common around cliffs. My go-to spot for the material is located Southeast of Midhaven, near the Teleporter in the area.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough Limestone is a higher-tier version of Stone, it does not require a higher-tier tool to harvest. As long as you have a Stone Pickaxe or better in your Inventory, you can harvest as much of the material as you need. High-quality tools will make mining it in bulk easier, but you can still get by with the bear minimal in a pinch.\n\nThe post Where to get Limestone in Towers of Aghasba appeared first on Destructoid.",

Next up is a partnership with SNK, with products from the Neo Geo lineup planned throughout 2025 and 2026. \n\n\nAs for what those products are, specific titles have yet to be announced. We can certainly imagine the multi-game carts that might be in the works for the Evercade platform, though. So far, Blaze simply says that \"licensed retro gaming products and physical cartridge releases\" are in the works. \n\n\nHere's the announcement in teaser trailer form:\n\n\n\n\nHardware mentioned in the PR includes Evercade EXP-R, VS-R, Alpha bartop arcade machines, and the HyperMegaTech branded Super Pocket devices. Look, I'm not asking for much, but it wouldn't hurt to slap a Metal Slug collection on a humble little Evercade cart, would it? Let's make it happen. \n\n\nThe first licensed SNK Neo Geo products are penciled in for some time in 2025. A special showcase video will kick things off with a look at the lineup, release dates, and pre-order info in Q1 2025. \"This partnership isn't just about adding great games; it's about celebrating the artistry and legacy of NEOGEO in a way that's accessible to fans old and new,\" said Blaze Entertainment CEO Andrew Byatt. \"We’re thrilled to give these classics a new platform in 2025.\"\n\n\nEvercade has been pretty good about steadily releasing new cartridges.

It's safe to expect a few promotions along the way as well before the holiday sales go live this year.\n\n\n\n\nWill Epic Games Store Winter Holiday Sale 2024 have giveaways?\n\n\nLike the last few years, it's safe to expect 12 days of giveaways once again, offering a free game each day. All you need to do is to have an Epic account and check out the website daily.\n\n\nTypically, Epic offers a wide range of games in its giveaways, from AAA releases to niche indie offerings. Whatever the case might be, they're all free, and as long as you add them to your in-game library, the items will stay there forever.\n\n\nIt will be exciting to find out what Epic has in store for all of us this year. 2024 has been a huge year for gaming itself, and there's a chance of finding a few of those titles as potential freebies.

It might seem common in rarity, but it doesn’t show until you have progressed deeply in the game. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on how you can find Lapislazuli in Enshrouded.\n\n\nHow to get Lapislazuli in Enshrouded\n\n\nYou can get Lapislazuli in Kindlewastes and Nomad Highlands biomes. But you can’t just pick it as it is since you need a pickaxe to mine it. To reach this area, go to the Vukah Cave Passage and keep moving south till you see a cliff. \n\n\nOnce you reach the cliff, you have to look at bone-structured rocks. Once you spot them, glide down, and you will see clusters of Lapislazuli lying at that place.\n\n\nWhere to use Lapislazuli in Enshrouded?\n\n\nYou can use Lapislazuli to craft several items like Iron Bench, Palm Wood Table, and more in the game. You can craft it with the help of Alchemist, Hunter, etc. Here is the list of all items:\n\n\nItem\nLapislazuli\n\n\nArchmage Chest\n6\n\n\nArchmage Gloves\n2\n\n\nArchmage Hat\n3\n\n\nBlue Globe\n5\n\n\nDeerstalker Chest\n2\n\n\nDeerstalker Hood\n1\n\n\nEternal Heal Channel\n50\n\n\nEthereal Plane\n1\n\n\nIron Bench\n8\n\n\nLarge Palm Wood Cupboard\n8\n\n\nPalm Wood Banquet Table\n20\n\n\nPalm Wood Table\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust keep in mind that this isn't the only requirement for crafting the items mentioned above. This simply shows how many Lapislazuli you need to craft them.\n\n\nYou can also use this resource to craft Eternal Spells with the help of the Alchemist. Not only that, it also helps you to strengthen the flame to level six. However, you will need 40 Lapislazuli to do that. It's a good way to explore more areas, as flames can help you travel anywhere within moments.\n\nThe post Enshrouded: How to get Lapislazuli appeared first on Destructoid.",

Things were a little limp, and the culprit quickly became apparent: a near total lack of hitstop.\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, \"hitstop\" is a period of freezeframes that games and animated media employ during a big impact to really sell the weight of the blow. It looks unrealistic, but it's ultra-satisfying when done appropriately, and it's a Monster Hunter staple. \n\n\nImage via Capcom\n\n\nA new interview over at PC Gamer with the game's director, Yuya Tokuda, reveals that the change was ironically the result of us Westerners complaining too much. \"Many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too [intense],\" Tokuda said regarding Monster Hunter: World. He expressed relief that players wanted it back, saying the feedback was \"very positive.\" \n\n\nNewer previews of the game's latest playable build have already reported vastly improved hitstop, making combat feel weightier and more satisfying. Speaking of combat, some weapons are getting \"big changes\" ahead of release, those being the Insect Glaive, Switch Axe, Lance, and Sword & Shield. As a lance player who heard less-than-favorable things from the open beta, this makes me very happy.\n\n\nI wish I could throw my two cents into the opinion well but unfortunately I was out of town during the open beta. From the sound of it, I too would've been disappointed by the floatier feeling combat, but I'm almost glad I was spared that month of gnawing anxiety before learning about these positive changes. Monster Hunter Wilds is shaping up to be a series great, thanks in no small part to the team's enthusiasm for feedback.\n\nThe post After beta feedback, hitstop is returning to Monster Hunter Wilds appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold has recently covered emotional abuse in El Paso, Elsewhere, voyeurism in Life Eater and Clockolding, and violent power fantasy in I Am Your Beast. Given that trend, I would not have guessed their next game would be a turn-based tactical game with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles licensing.\n\n\nUh, yeah, so as part of the PC Game Show, Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, which is exactly as I described: turn-based turtles. “I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?\" said Xalavier Nelson Jr. Bummer, dude, but the turtles have met Batman and the Ghostbusters. Can you say that?\n\n\nTrailer via PC Gamer\n\n\nThat means a new antagonist has the job of harrowing the turtles. That at least means that the enemies don’t have to exclusively be the Foot Clan, but, from what’s shown, it’s just Foot Clan. Also, each level shows off only one turtle on each level, rather than having you control all four of them. That strikes me as a bit weird, but the press release seems to imply that each turtle has their own storyline.\n\n\nThe actual look of the game is very Strange Scaffold, which is to say, low budget and creative with its resources. The characters are shown as small figurines, and the environments are small spaces with psychedelic backgrounds.\n\n\nConsidering the fact that the big-budget games space has now become so expensive that companies will only take a risk on big established licenses, it’s nice to see these sorts of games fall to fans at smaller developers. We still get more cash-grabby licensed games, but at least that’s not the only way.\n\n\nThere’s no announced release date for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, and thus far, only PC has been announced.\n\nThe post Can’t say I expected Strange Scaffold’s next game to be turn-based Ninja Turtles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you decide to head to Enigma of Fear’s Crystal Cave from the Perimeter, you’ll soon encounter a new enemy: a sprightly critter with glowing green crystals sprouting from its body. Chances are you’ve died to it a couple of times and are now seeking some assistance. How exactly do you kill the glowy foe in the Crystal Cave?\n\n\nA crystal monster in Crystal Cave\n\n\nUnlike the Blood Zombies, which can't see at all, this new enemy in Enigma of Fear seems to have great eyesight. It's also fast and will pursue you out of the room while generating waves of fear that eventually knock you out and spell game over.\n\n\nTo take out the radiant fiend, you need to perform one extra step than when fighting Blood Zombies. Rather than pressing the Flashlight button to toggle between regular and blue light, hold the button to open a wheel menu. At the top is an option to turn off the flashlight entirely, which you may have overlooked.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFlashlight extinguished, crouch, sneak up behind the monster, and whack it from behind. Be wary, though. Turning off the flashlight makes you less detectable, but you're not invisible. Like with the Blood Zombies, you still need to use some strategy when creeping up.\n\n\nWhatever happened to Oswald?\n\n\nWhen close enough, you’ll get an Interact prompt to knock the glowing guy out. He’ll drop an item, which reveals that this poor thing is what remains of the researcher Oswald Magani, whose name you may have already encountered once or twice. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are a few other interesting tidbits in the room Oswald was guarding: a couple of lore building items, a letter that provides clues about how to take out Goliath, and a medkit, which you'll probably need by now. Then it’s time to delve further into the Crystal Cave, where you might run into more of Enigma of Fear's corrupted researchers.\n\nThe post How to kill the Crystal Cave’s glowy monster in Enigma of Fear appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Minecraft has recently released their most anticipated Pale Garden update. Some of the major features are Pale Garden Biome, Creaking Mob, and Resin. Here are the details of every major feature in the Pale Garden update in Minecraft.\n\n\nAll major features in Pale Garden update in Minecraft\n\n\n\n\nPale Garden \n\n\nPale Garden is the biggest highlight in this Minecraft update. This is a new biome, which is a variation of the Dark Forest. What’s even better is that you can see a lot of Pale Oaks and Eyeblossoms in this biome. Both Pale Oaks and Eyeblossoms are the new species that is going to debut in this update.\n\n\nApart from that, you will also hear new ambient sounds that are specifically for Pale Garden. \n\n\nAlso, animal mobs will not naturally spawn in this biome. However, you have to be aware of the new monster \"Creaking,” which lurks there at night or during thunderstorms.\n\n\nCreaking Mob\n\n\nAs mentioned before, Creaking Mob is a new monster that will spawn in Pale Garden. It is tough to beat as it does not take any damage when it is naturally spawned. Also, it is resistant to the fire, so the only way to destroy them is to destroy the Creaking Heart, which is controlling this monster. \n\n\nThe only clue for finding the Creaking Heart is that it is within the radius of 32 blocks from the Creaking mob. So you have to search the surrounding area before daylight hits or the Creaking Mob is not in the radius of 32 blocks.\n\n\nResin\n\n\nThis Minecraft update also brings a new resource called Resin, which you can collect in the Pale Garden biome. How can you obtain it? It is very simple; you have to hit the Creaking mob with any kind of weapon. As you do it, the Creaking Heart will drop resins on the ground. You can then use these Resins to build new blocks in the game.\n\nThe post Minecraft Pale Garden update: All major features, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For as long as there's been Doom, there's been a way to modify and tinker with id Software's iconic FPS. Indeed, the original has been ported in so many interesting and bizarre ways, including on a smart toothbrush. Did you even know there were smart toothbrushes?\n\n\nAnyway, the time has come to unleash it unto Stardew Valley. You can see it in action on the Reddit thread below, but it does exactly what it says on the tin by adding an arcade cabinet into the game that will allow you to play the original Doom.\n\n\n\n\nSimply referred to as \"DoomValley,\" you can install it yourself by downloading the file from GitHub. User wojciech-graj provides installation instructions for both Windows and Linux. However, do note that it doesn't work with sound. But you all know what Doom sounds like at this point.\n\n\nI should have said StarDoom Valley...it was right there!\n\n\nBased on the above footage, it looks as though you just have to purchase the cabinet from Gus in the Stardrop Saloon. It'll only set you back 10,000 gold, but if you play it the way my girlfriend does, you're all basically millionaires at this point, I'd wager.\n\n\nHonestly, given that Stardew Valley already has an arcade machine that plays its own minigame, I'm surprised it's taken this long to add Doom into it. Unless there are multiple instances of this happening in the past, I'm just not with the times anymore.\n\n\nBe that as it may, it still astounds me that Doom keeps getting all this love some 30 years after it was released. Given that we've seen it running on a John Deere tractor, a pregnancy test, and even E. coli cells (sort of), porting it to Stardew almost seems passé at this point.\n\nThe post At long last, Doom can be played in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

To celebrate his performances, EA Sports has released a new card, which is part of its own SBC. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge and if doing so is worth your resources at all. \n\n\nEA FC 25 Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC tasks\n\n\nThe Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC has two different tasks, and here are their conditions.\n\n\nTask 1 - Top Form\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Team of the Week\n\n\nMin.

Team Rating: 85\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest POTM SBC. \n\n\nTask 1 - Top Form\n\n\n\nAny 10 83-rated items\n\n\nAny 82-rated TOTW item\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Serie A\n\n\n\nVitinha 85\n\n\nAlex Remiro 84\n\n\nOberdorf 86\n\n\nLittle 86\n\n\nDe Ligt 84\n\n\nBuchanan 84\n\n\nGuirassy 84\n\n\nMarcus Thuram 83\n\n\nBenzema 86\n\n\nGrealish 84\n\n\nCasemiro 84\n\n\n\nThis POTM SBC has decent value when I analyze the card. The Trivela+ playstyle is always useful if you know how to get the best out of it. It also has the Chip Shot, Rapid, and Power Shot playstyles, and offers 94 Pace and 86 Shooting. 4* Weak Foot is decent as well, but there's a limitation. \n\n\nKean's POTM item only has Poacher++ and no other roles. I am unsure why EA Sports designed the item like that, but it's a limiting factor. If you use a Poached, this item can be a great addition. \n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Moise Kean Serie A POTM SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)",

          "description": "Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A \"nevíme jak\" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…",
