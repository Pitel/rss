          "description": "A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.\nThat Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.\nRugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The furore across the internet upon the announcement of the Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, however, seemed to burn twice as bright.\nFeaturing seven titles, there’s nothing but gold across the board. It includes every pixel-drawn Marvel fighting game up to and including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and all arcade originals. Capcom has ploughed the package with bonuses, from beautifully defined CRT filters and music players to original arcade art galleries, region switching, superb training modes, save states, and 4:3 screen bezels. For online play, Capcom's own rollback netcode is present and working fluidly. Although we can’t comment on how it will hold up when the servers go global, we’re optimistic it will be well maintained. You can hop in and out of matches, take on casual and ranked match-ups, and spectate freely. It’s quite the fighting festival, and buffed to a shine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to \"technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines,\" according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production.

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "Babbdi was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.\nNow, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.\nRead more",

Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that \"combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders\", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.\n Read more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

While it's not quite as chaotic and entangled as say, Disgaea, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of those games. I'd call it \"baroque\", but that would be out of synch with developer Sandfall Interactive's stated influences: the new RPG takes place in a molten and fragmented fantasy world based on the Belle Époque or \"beautiful era\" of late 19th century France. Your job as player is to stop a sorcerous Paintress from painting everybody over a certain age out of existence. We'll circle back to the plot, though. First, the excessively ornate battlin'.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).\r\n\n\r\nAll of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said \"Richard!\" (only my mum calls me Richard) \"get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise!

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

          "description": "If you’re planning on refining a melee build in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, you may see that there are three defense types such as block, balance, and fencing. \n\n\nThe former two are straightforward, so what is fencing? We’ll break this down below and compare it between the other two types.\n\n\nWhat is fencing in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2?\n\n\nFencing is a defense type on melee weapons that is primarily focused on performing parries. This is one of the stronger options if you’re trying to maintain your health and armor upkeep. \n\n\nIt requires better timing when you see a blue enemy circle indicating they’re about to attack. In other cases, you can still parry attacks that don’t appear with the indicator as long as it isn’t the lethal red one.\n\n\nFencing compared to block and balance\n\n\nFencing is a high-risk, high-reward playstyle compared to the other two defense types. Your timing has to be good. Otherwise, you’ll suffer a lot of damage and possibly go down, especially with higher difficulties.\n\n\nWith balance, you can play defensively or use parrying. This is if you want to still parry but also block if you get overrun or you’re still practicing on your timing.\n\n\nLastly, the block defense type lives up to its name. It focuses on blocking attacks and having massive damage reduction over performing reversals. If your timing is bad or you are going to rely on other players to take out big, this is going to be more up your alley.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIs fencing the best defense type?\n\n\nTechnically, this would be the best type, but it’s dependent on your skill. Performing a parry means that you’ll be performing finisher attacks more often on enemies. \n\n\nDuring these finisher animations on enemies, you’re completely invulnerable. So, performing these back-to-back will make you even more tanky and an excellent bait for other players to take out high-priority targets like Majoris and Extremis-level enemies.\n\nThe post What is fencing in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After six years of Cursed Spirits slaying, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga is almost on its way out with its final arc. It'll finally determine the fate of the beloved Jujutsu Sorcerors, an ensemble that has endured many trials and tribulations since the start. We'll show you when to expect Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending to prepare you for its conclusion.\n\n\nJujutsu Kaisen manga end date\n\n\nJJK creator Gege Akutami first announced the manga's ending, marking its conclusion after a select few chapters. The saga's official page also confirmed a more precise date: Sept. 30, 2024. That means Chapter 271 will be the last of the series, tying into the Shinjuku Showdown arc.\n\n\nYou can look forward to the remaining chapters, which will debut every Sunday until the end of September. They can typically be read for free on Viz Media or Manga Plus, featuring other recent storylines.\n\n\nImage via MAPPA\n\n\nAs for what we can expect from Jujutsu Kaisen's manga ending, it could go down in plenty of ways. I won't go into too much about what's been happening in the manga to avoid any spoilers, but I will say that it does correlate with the main objective of bringing the infamous Sukuna down. Whatever the case may be for the manga, the conclusion will undoubtedly explain what happens to the Jujutsu Sorcerers or even include one more battle just for kicks.\n\n\nFortunately, the JJK adventures have yet to conclude with the promise of new episodes. While not much is known about Season 3, we can remain hopeful for more details in the coming months. There's still a lot to dig into with the anime's current place in the timeline, which may cover the entirety of its following season. Given the success of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, there's a good chance we might see the show's ending as a film instead. We'll possibly get more information about this once the manga concludes. \n\nThe post When will the Jujutsu Kaisen manga end? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Apparently, they’re just “Talking Flower.”\n\n\nThe announcement came in the form of a single Tweet, so there aren’t too many details on it. I don’t know what you’d want to know. They talk. It would be weird if they didn’t. I also don’t know why you’d want it to. Some people played through Super Mario Wonder without muting those awful things. Normally, I’d assume that this is because they didn’t know they could be turned off, but some people supposedly like them. I have hated them since the first trailer.\n\n\n\n\nUgh, they sound worse in Japanese. “Ganbare!” it shrieks upon the first squeeze. “Kimi no bouken wo…” Why? What was the point of these things? They make me want to salt the earth. “Waaaaandaaaaaa!” it screams, as though it cries in anguish at the falling heavens in some dramatic movie.\n\n\nThe quality of the plush at least looks pretty good. I want to say that some of the stuffies from the Mario series I have around my apartment were made by Sanei. Just checked; they are. I have a 1-up mushroom that has lasted me since college, so that’s a good sign. It’s important to note that the Talking Mushroom also has a cavity in its face, which you could use to put your… popcorn in.

The manga will return in the December issue of Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine, which is set to release on November 4. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to Anime News Network, Kato shared that her hiatus is due to health reasons. She revealed that she was diagnosed with a certain illness in March. She also continuously worked on the manga while receiving treatment and undergoing hospital visits. Recently, however, she underwent an operation. \n\n\nEven though the operation is successful and she has already been released from the hospital, the postoperative recovery process will require more time, prompting the break. Kato does not want to disclose the specifics of her illness at the moment, but she does reassure fans that it is not life-threatening.\n\n\nBlue Exorcist tells the story of Rin Okumura, a son of Satan. Secretly raised by Father Fujimoto, a renowned exorcist, Rin’s life takes a dramatic turn when he uncovers the truth about his demonic lineage. Determined to defeat Satan, Rin enrolls in True Cross Academy, where he begins training to become an exorcist.\n\n\nFor readers eager to follow the story, the manga is available digitally on VIZ Media and MANGA Plus. Furthermore, the anime's latest season, Blue Exorcist: Beyond the Snow Saga, will start on October 5.

While it can only drop as a potential reward from lower difficulties, Grandmaster Nightfalls give a guaranteed Adept version of the weapon. \n\n\nOn occasion, the weapon of the week is a particularly good sniper. Here's the god roll for the Uzume RR4 sniper rifle in Destiny 2, including perks and attachments.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Uzume RR4 in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Uzume RR4 sports the Adaptive Frame archetype, giving the sniper better stats all around within any notable downsides. While this can be seen as boring since it doesn't do anything particularly exciting, it does open us up to picking perks that make the gun better in general, instead of improving a specific aspect of it. With that freedom in mind, the following setup should work quite nicely:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Arrowhead Brake\n\n\nMagazine: Tactical Mag\n\n\nPerk 1: Fourth Time's the Charm\n\n\nPerk 2: Vorpal Weapon\n\n\n\nArrowhead Brake is always a great barrel for snipers, granting better handling speed and reduced recoil. Tactical Mag is also just a great Magazine, since it gives reload speed, magazine size, and stability. Who doesn't want that on a sniper? \n\n\nFourth Time's the Charm is like a budget version of the Whisper of the Worm, granting two shots to your magazine when hitting four precision shots in quick succession. Extra free ammo is just free damage. Finally, we have Vorpal Weapon, which helps make the Uzume do better damage against bosses.

The revival version of the Reckoning: Dawn of Heroes set will feature an all-new progression system as well. Teamfight Tactics Revival: Dawn of Heroes goes live on September 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThis is just the second set revival Riot has done for Teamfight Tactics, with the Set 3.5 Revival: Galaxies launching earlier this year. The set revival is a temporary game mode in which Teamfight Tactics champions and traits from the Reckoning: Dawn of Heroes set from 2021 are revamped to fit with today's version of TFT.\n\n\nAlso coming with this new set revival is a new ladder progression system, where players can unlock new ranks and rewards based on how they play the new TFT Revival game mode. Also, even though augments didn't exist back when Reckoning: Dawn of Heroes released—they are now a staple part of TFT gameplay—new augments have been created to specifically work with the set revival. New augments include The Monstrous Chopper, an Abomination trait-focused augment where the Monstrosity from the trait equips an ax to do additional cleave damage, as well as Death Approaches, which allows Thresh to hook himself to the farthest enemy and do additional damage on his next attack.\n\n\nPlayers interested in checking out the Teamfight Tactics Revival: Dawn of Heroes limited-time game mode will be able to do so on both PC and mobile when TFTPatch 14.19 drops on September 25, 2024. The limited-time set will last through patch 14.21 which releases on November 4, 2024.\n\nThe post Teamfight Tactics second set revival is Dawn of Heroes, out later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

First, look for the Gold Medal Beans structure in front of Joestar Estate.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGo toward the side of the building and climb up the ladder to reach the rooftop. There will be a few Speedwagon thugs here, but you can avoid them to focus on the mission.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTurn left and cross the wooden board to reach the next rooftop. Here, you'll find the elusive Speedwagon's hat for the World of Stands quest. Return to Robert, who should be underneath the same building where you found the hat. As a token of his gratitude, he'll reward you with 200 gold and 270 XP.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWith the successful retrieval of Speedwagon's hat, you'll unlock the character's next quest, Can't Fight This Feeling. This mission is a crucial part of the main quest line, and by defeating three Speedwagon gang members, you'll earn more gold and XP. They'll be lingering around London, including near the hat location, so they shouldn't be too challenging to find. Utilize your Stand companion for quick takedowns, progressing you further in World of Stands.\n\nThe post Where to find Speedwagon’s Hat in World of Stands appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since 1998, the series has delighted and, often, enraged many fans. Super Mario Party Jamboree is next in line, bringing new ways to play and yell.\n\n\nTo be fair, most of the venting is due to the series of party games being surprisingly competitive, despite its delightfully spirited aesthetic. I've often joked that if you're looking to ruin friendships, few things work better than discussing religion, politics, or playing Mario Party. The games are a lot of fun for large gatherings, featuring exciting minigames to compete in as one of many dozens of Mario characters.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nParty up in here\n\n\nThere are more than 20 Mario Party games across an assor…",

          "description": "The official ratings reveal for EA FC 25 has begun, and EA Sports has revealed the top 25 names in women's football.\n\n\nAfter giving a massive push last year, women's football will continue to be a growing force across all game modes. This year, Barcelona's Aitana Bonmati has risen to the top of the rating chain with an overall rating of 91. She's followed closely by other big stars plying their trades across European football. Without further ado, let's take a look at who has made it to the list of the top 25.\n\n\nTop 25 women's footballers in EA FC 25\n\n\nHere's the complete list of all the names of those who have made it to the top 25.\n\n\n\nAitana Bonmati CM 91\n\n\nAlexia Putellas CM 90\n\n\nCaroline Graham Hansen RW 90\n\n\nSam Kerr ST 90\n\n\nSophia Smith ST 89\n\n\nAda Hegerberg ST 89\n\n\nMapi Leon 89\n\n\nMarie Antoinette Katoto ST 88\n\n\nDebinha CAM 88\n\n\nKadidiatou Diani RW 88\n\n\nPatri Guijarro CDM 88\n\n\nBeth Mead RW 88\n\n\nWendie Renard CB 88\n\n\nGuro Reiten LM 88\n\n\nIrene Paredes CB 88\n\n\nChristine Endler GK 88\n\n\nAlexandra Popp ST 87\n\n\nSakina Karchaoui LB 87\n\n\nMallory Swanson LM 87\n\n\nRose Lavelle 87\n\n\nEwa Pajor ST 87\n\n\nLauren Hemp LW 86\n\n\nKhadija Shaw ST 86\n\n\nFridolina Rolfo LB 86\n\n\nSelma Bacha LB 86\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top-25 list includes some fan favorites. Aitana is followed closely by WSL star Sam Kerr and her own Barcelona clubmates Alexia Putellas and Caroline Graham Hansen. All three have an overall rating of 90. Barcelona could be the best club in women's football, as they have more stars on this list.\n\n\nThe top league in French football also has its fair share of representatives, led by Hegerberg and Renard. The duo of Karchaoui and Bacha will be a favorite of those who swear by the meta. In comparison, the WSL has taken a few hits, but Reiten and Mead could be wonderful cards to use in Ultimate Team.\n\n\nWe will review all the cards in detail once EA FC 25 goes live on early access on September 20.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 ratings: Top 25 stars from women’s football appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s been 25 long years since the release of the Dreamcast (in North America), Sega’s short-lived but beloved little console. That’s about the time that society began to slide downhill. To celebrate this (the console, not the slide), Limited Run Games has some great swag to take you back to the before times.\n\n\nThe big push they’re doing is mostly behind the trading cards, which they say are the “coolest trading cards to grace your eyeballs and touch your fingertips.” Wow, it sounds like I wrote that. Although, I probably would have said “touch your eyeballs” or to give it even more of a vaguely creepy sound. There are 200 cards featuring Dreamcast art that you can smear across your retina. You can buy a hobby box with 20 cards for $24.99 or a booster box with 120 cards for $124.99.\n\n\nImage via Limited Run Games\n\n\nI don’t collect cards and never have. Is that normal pricing for trading cards? The booster packs look like VMUs and there are some cool card storage options. Hold on, I can’t get over the price. And then you can pay for sleeves and a box?\n\n\nThe other gear seems a lot more reasonable to me. There’s a skateboard deck for $74.99, a pin, a coin, and a keychain. There’s a hat for $31.99 and a hoodie for $54.99, which seem like fair prices. Everything seems priced right, but the cards give me pause. But, like I said, I know nothing about trading cards. They should have made it a CCG so we could pit Crazy Taxi against Space Channel 5.\n\n\nPre-orders are open now, with the shipping date for the items predicted for March 2025. That production time sounds very Limited Run Games. I’m not throwing shade. I like LRG for the most part, but you grow to expect long lead times.\n\nThe post Party like its 1999 with Limited Run Games’ Dreamcast gear appeared first on Destructoid.",
