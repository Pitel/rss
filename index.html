Under this system, user identities would not have been obtained by BREIN, but after a local ISP refused to cooperate and BREIN&#x27;s request to proceed was denied twice in court, BREIN had a decision to make.

When Nintendo announced that it was developing a movie based on The Legend of Zelda, Shigeru Miyamoto wrenched control of Nintendo&#x27;s Twitter account away from the company&#x27;s social team to give a few short details on the project.
There, he stated that he had been &quot;working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san&quot;. We took &quot;many years&quot; to mean three or four, possibly five at a push, but it turns out we were way off.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Modern Warfare 3 was developed in about half the time Call of Duty titles usually take. With only a year and a half to work on the game, development was fraught with issues, Schreier&#x27;s sources reveal. 


As Schreier explains, MW3 was originally pitched as a DLC, but the game was suddenly turned into a standalone title to fill in a gap in the company&#x27;s release schedule after another 2023 CoD game planned for this year was delayed. This has been denied by an Activision spokesperson, but Schreier insists that &quot;more than a dozen current and former Call of Duty developers said that conflicts with what they were told at the time.&quot;

Solid Snake is two different people — just like the real Big Boss


In the Metal Gear Solid series, Solid Snake would feature an original look for the first game, but then become heavily inspired by Snake Plissken from John Carpenter&#x27;s Escape From New York. You might know that one considering how Snake actually goes undercover as &quot;Pliskin&quot; in Metal Gear Solid 2, but did you know that the character began life because of a…</span>

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 is already a scary game. Having a guy who looks and sounds like Max Payne coming at you like an aggressive red panda probably isn&#x27;t necessary. Luckily, a new update for Alan Wake 2 fixes a T-posing Alex Casey while addressing progression-halting bugs.


To be fair, the latter is arguably far more terrifying. Most should agree that a bug stopping your story progress in a game is both scary and frustrating. In fact, it actually happened to me yesterday in Alan Wake 2. The rides at the Espresso Express were clipped into the wooden platform, and the capsule that was supposed to move out of the way wasn&#x27;t. And I didn&#x27;t feel like pushing a wheelbarrow around. Luckily, things should be sorted out after today.

                              <span>Today Sony revealed that it’s shifting its strategy with live service games. The company is scaling back the number of live service games it plans by fiscal year 2025 to launch by half.


In case you didn’t remember, just last May Sony announced ambitious plans to release a total of 12 live service games by the end of its fiscal 2025. In theory, having a deep catalog of live service titles would give Sony a steady stream of income from players who fully bought into their favorite games. Now, Sony seems to be acknowledging that creating that deep catalog is easier said than done. 


In a November 9 earnings call, Hiroki Totoki, COO, CFO, and President of Sony, elaborated on what led to this change in plans. Totoki said that after Sony acquired Bungie last July, the company had the developer help refine its plan for live service games. Ultimately, Totoki said that Sony realized it’s previous plan wouldn’t be able to produce satisfactory games. 


“We have not been able to meet the gamers’ expectations,” Totoki said, “But we are trying as much as possible [to ensure these games will] be played by gamers and liked by gamers for a long time.” To make that happen, Totoki said, “six titles will be released by FY25. That’s our current plan.” 


The other six live service games aren’t going anywhere just yet. Totoki said that the company is still deciding when those games will be released, but for now it will focus on making sure the first six games are as good as possible. He didn’t mention which games made the cut for the initial six, so the fate of specific titles like The Last of Us multiplayer, which was delayed earlier this year, is still up in the air.

                              <span>I like to think my Steam Deck OLED review was a sufficiently broad piece of opinioning, but in the spirit of plurality – and because we already did it with that Steam Deck Second Opinion video – I wanted our head honcho Katharine to give her take.

                              <span>The original Risk Of Rain was a chaotic, 2D sidescroller about turning a tiny character into a wandering projectile swarm. It&#x27;s sequel mimicked the systems but switched from pixel art to 3D - and in my eyes lost a little of its readability in the process.

Enter Risk Of Rain Returns, a full remaster of the 2D original with higher resolution artwork, new survivors, and slicker multiplayer. It&#x27;s out now.

Reviewers hit it with low scores and said it felt short, rushed, and incomplete.

                              <span>Google offered developer Epic Games $147 million to put Fortnite on the Google Play Store, according to The Verge’s reporting of the ongoing legal battle between Epic and Google. 


Epic’s initial decision to release Fortnite via its own third-party launcher in 2018 seemed to have sent a chill down Google’s spine, and resulted in the $147 million deal being made and rejected by Epic. The deal would’ve seen the massive total being delivered over three years via &quot;incremental funding.&quot;


By putting Fortnite on the Play Store directly, it’s being argued that Google aimed to prevent a loss of in-app fees that would stem from other developers following in Epic’s footsteps. The confirmation of this $147 million deal arrived amid the third day of the tech giants&#x27; court bout.

Unraveling its secrets, getting to the heart of what Signalis is trying to do or say haunts me almost a year later. There are few games like it — Signalis hammers in its sense of hopelessness and rips my heart out with every playthrough. Everything about it feels oppressive and dire, but in a way that’s hard to move on from. I&#x27;ve embarked on Elster&#x27;s journey again and again, hoping for a better end, running this treadmill of maddening sadness. But it&#x27;s easier to go back here than move on.

                              <span>As part of today’s Netflix Geeked event, the streamer confirmed that Arcane Season 2 will be out in November 2024. In the 15-second long teaser, we can see Jinx solemnly walking towards what appears to be the Bridge of Progress in Piltover, but it’s surrounded in an ominous shade of crimson.




In the teaser, we can hear Jinx humming the melody line from “The Bridge,” which is featured in the score for the first season. Behind that, her footsteps echo and what could be the environment catching aflame and chaos ensuing can be heard. It’s bound to be an exciting continuation, based on this alone. 


It’s not exactly news that Arcane is getting a second season. Shortly after the first season concluded on November 20, 2021, the powers that be at Riot Games made the announcement that a second season was “in production.” It’s not even news that the series would be returning at the end of 2024, thanks to an investor presentation given by Tencent in September 2023, which revealed it’d be coming during Q4.


But, we now know for certain that Arcane will be returning in November 2024. I am not at all sure why we’re being told now, with a year left to wait for more of the League of Legends story, but some of the recent strikes in Hollywood that may have put a pause on production. 


I suppose we’ve already waited two years, what’s one more? In the meantime, I’ll just be over here, with “Enemy” by Imagine Dragons and JID playing on perpetual repeat.

                              <span>An unknown number of employees have been laid off at Warframe developer and Wayfinder publisher Digital Extremes today. According to Polgyon, at least 20 employees in total were let go. It appears Digital Extremes is closing their external projects division which publishes games like the recently Early Access release title Wayfinder. Instead, the company will shift its focus towards internal projects like Warframe and Soulframe. 


We reached out to Digital Extremes who confirmed the information and provided the following statement



“We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division. We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result.”




The representative also confirmed that Digital Extremes is looking to transfer Wayfinder in its entirety into the hands of the developer, Airship Syndicate.



&quot;“We&#x27;re working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in coming months.&quot;




Just a few weeks ago there was a leadership change at Digital Extremes as well, with Chief Creative Officer Steven Sinclair replacing Founder James Schmalz as CEO of the company.


Rough times in the video games industry


These kinds of articles are never easy to write, especially when the video game industry seems to be suffering layoffs several times a week. Just yesterday Embracer Group laid off staff at developer Free Radical, after doing the same just last month at Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios. Ubisoft Montreal also suffered layoffs earlier this week.


This list has grown so big it almost feels easier to name the companies that have not conducted layoffs compared to those that have. According to the website VideoGameLayoffs.com, over 6,500 employees from over 100 companies in the games industry have been laid off this year alone.

                              <span>With Kratos&#x27; vicious past, you wouldn&#x27;t expect a God of War Ragnarok Lo-Fi video to surface. However, PlayStation and a few musicians, including Alex Moukala, have released such a thing, and it&#x27;s relaxing AF.




Chilling out with Atreus


Atreus, in this video published Thursday, takes the place of the kid studying. As the chill music is playing, he&#x27;s writing in his journal. The Lo-Fi beats in the background are from popular musician and composer Alex Moukala and Pokari.


&quot;Earlier this year, Sony asked me to create some God of War: Ragnarok Lo-Fi remixes for them,&quot; Moukala on social media. &quot;As a massive Bear McCreary fan I was overjoyed and simply couldn&#x27;t say no!&quot; The composer later said &quot;the whole process made [him] appreciate God of War&#x27;s soundtrack even more than [he] already did.&quot;


The three McCreary songs both Moukala and Polari remixed are: &quot;Huldra Brothers,&quot; &quot;Memories of Mother,&quot; and the God of War Ragnarök theme. They sound fantastic and are currently powering me through this news story. The animation is also expressive and slightly changes over the span of the 32-minute video. It was drawn and animated by Spud Gun Studios.


Moukala has been busy over the past few years. He&#x27;s behind the soundtrack for the fan-based Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project and interviewed the Yakuza game composers on his YouTube channel. In the past, he&#x27;s also turned the macabre Bloodborne music into a dazzling Mario Kart track.




God of War: Ragnarok celebrates its one-year anniversary this week. When it was first released, it received critical praise across the board. 


&quot;God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it,&quot; said our review. &quot;While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go.&quot;

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy kind of came and went earlier this year (twice, if you count the PS4/Xbox One ports), and now it&#x27;s about to release a third time: on Switch. It&#x27;s due out on November 14, and depending on who you ask, the below debut game trailer is either miraculous or messy. It really depends on your taste in Switch ports. The real test is going to be how it plays and if it can maintain a consistent framerate.


Super Crazy Rhythm Castle will offer some counterprogramming. Described as a &quot;chaotic rhythm adventure,&quot; this single-system multiplayer game looks promising. It&#x27;s out on November 14. Plus, a bunch of other games are out between now and the next week, so check them all out below!

Call of Duty is no stranger to having a cheater problem, but MW3 is looking to hopefully remedy some of those issues. In a post on the COD blog, Activision has revealed how they plan to use machine learning to combat cheaters.

The team dedicated to combatting cheating in Call of Duty, Team Ricochet, has developed the Ricochet: Anti-Cheat over the past two years with the existing Call of Duty titles. With both client and server-side systems utilizing Machine Learning, the post claims the speed and accuracy of prevention and detection systems have been improved.

                              <span>Taking inspiration from games like Slay the Spire, Alina of the Arena unleashed its gladiatorial combat on PC in 2022. Now it&#x27;s set to launch on consoles later this month.


DANGEN Entertainment and PINIX Games announced plans to bring Alina of the Arena to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox digital stores on November 23, 2023. In addition to the deckbuilding of Slay the Spire, the devs cite Into the Breach as inspiration. Alina of the Arena blends roguelite elements with hex-based tactics, resource management, and more that unfolds in strategic position-based gladiator battles. You can see a sample of its style in the release date trailer and screens. 




Alina of the Arena follows a gladiator named Alina who aims to entertain a particularly bloodthirsty crowd while rising up the ranks. You can pick up weapons the crowd tosses into the arena, upgrade equipment, and acquire new cards to improve your strategy. Some cards may help Alina deal more damage, while others assist in avoiding attacks or even pitting enemies against one another for a tactical advantage. 


The flow of each level spans standard battles, elite battles, shops, events, and ultimately a showdown with the arena&#x27;s champion. Permanent upgrades can be unlocked along with new builds to give you a fighting chance in successive runs.

Are you not entertained?


Alina of the Arena picked up some accolades following its initial launch on PC. In addition to nominations at events like BitSummit and IndiePlay, it won the Best Design Indie Game Award at Taipei Game Show 2023. Outside of UI updates, it sounds like we can expect the same features that made it a success when it lands on consoles on November 23.

                              <span>Valve has just announced the Steam Deck OLED, due to release in very short order on November 16. Effectively an upgrade to the baseline Steam Deck model, the OLED variant will even have a substantially upgraded battery, making the device that much more appealing.


What&#x27;s particularly interesting here is that as the OLED model of the Steam Deck rolls in, Valve is phasing out the 64 GB and the 512 GB variants of the original device. As of right now, these version of the Deck are only going to stay in stock while supplies last (with an appropriate price drop), and new buyers will be able to purchase the following versions of the device in the future:



256 GB LCD version of the Steam Deck at $399


512 GB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $549


1 TB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $649

                              <span>Do you hate traffic? Do you yearn to punish drivers? Sebil Engineering is a jank-pop game about directing a steady stream of traffic using only terraforming tools. It’s available today on Steam and Itch.


As a pedestrian, cars are my mortal enemy. Unfortunately, so far, my only way of fighting back against them is with my fists. I guess that’s because I chose to write about video games rather than become a civil engineer. According to Sebil Engineering, they are given pipe-wrenches that can increase or decrease the height of nodes on the edges of roads to give traffic a shunt in the correct direction.




Each level begins with a stream of cars pouring in from the margins. Your job is to change the heights of the road to direct that stream to the correct spot. I imagine that’s what getting up to pee at night is like for men.


Sebil Engineering includes more than 40 levels of Lemmings-like carnage. It boasts “high detail traffic simulation” and “realistic civil engineering.” The trailers available support both of those bullet points.


Real talk: I’ve got a lot of steam built up, and Sebil Engineering looks like a good way to let it out. I’m also in love with jank-pop, which is to say, games that look like they match the very worst examples from a bygone era. See also Suburban Basketball and Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer.


Sebil Engineering is available right now for PC on Steam and Itch.io.

                              <span>After a week of nearly nonstop play, I hit a wall with Warcraft Rumble and the grind is in sight. Here&#x27;s how it all went!


Warcraft Rumble (Android, iOS [reviewed on an iPhone 13])
Developer: Blizzard
Publisher: Blizzard
Released: November 3, 2023
MSRP: Free-to-play (with microtransactions)





The core game is fun, but it needs some economy tweaks


Warcraft Rumble is a 1v1 tap-to-deploy lane-based battler that asks you to send units off to micro-wars to take down an opposing headquarters. Your job? To march and destroy the opposite base before your opponent takes out your own, through clever countering and smart resource management. Each unit is associated with a cost (typically dependent on power level), and while your unit coffers recharge automatically, Kobolds can be deployed to mi…</span>

                              <span>A mod now available for One Step From Eden lets players take control of Super Sonic in the popular deck-building roguelike. The mod, developed and released on the Steam Workshop by user SoulCakeLive, comes packaged with 6 spells, a weapon, and an artifact meant to eviscerate your foes left and right. 




“As my way of celebrating the first anniversary of #SonicFrontiers, SUPER SONIC IS NOW PLAYABLE IN @OneStepFromEden!! This includes an outfit swap for Super Sonic 2!” SoulCakeLive said on Twitter.


Super Sonic’s spells available in this mod include:



Super Sonic Wind, a targeted wind ability that moves in a direct line to your opponent.


Super Homing Shot, which sends a barrage of attacks in varying directions.


Super Earth Crash, which halts enemies for 5 seconds.


Maximum Avatar, which sends clones of Super Sonic to attack all enemies on the field.


Mach Burst, which allows you to teleport to an enemy, unleashing a damaging attack.


Time Break, which stops time for 7 seconds and allows you to unleash heck on enemies.



In addition to these spells, this mod also includes a weapon, Super Sonic Boom, which bombards enemies with a non-stop volley of attacks; and an artifact, Chaos Emeralds, which allows players to recover 20HP every 10 seconds during battles.




Also, the mod comes with an outfit swap featuring the Super Sonic 2 design from Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon. So, it’s hardly your average asset swap mod, and is more akin to an additional, albeit unofficial, DLC pack for One Step From Eden. 




It would appear this pack has even been noticed by the developer, Thomas Moon Kang. In a response to the original tweet by SoulCakeLive, the account for One Step From Eden replied with “That’s super cool.”

                              <span>The Oh Deer Alan Wake thermoses have been sought after by franchise fans, but it has proven difficult to secure one. They were briefly restocked by iam8bit, but not many have managed to get one for themselves, as they have sold out in seconds. 


The &quot;super limited batch&quot; of thermoses went on sale at 09:00 AM PT today and there wasn&#x27;t much of a window available, as by 09:01 AM, they were already sold out. Understandably, this has resulted in a lot of upset fans who are once again left without a thermos. 


As many on Reddit report, they were there as soon as the blue thermoses went live, but the stock was cleared before they could even finish processing payment. The frustration is compounded by the fact that prior runs were very limited and came with some pretty high shipping costs depending on where you live. Remedy&#x27;s response hasn&#x27;t helped calm the situation either. 




On Twitter, many have already been complaining about how quickly the thermoses have sold out, with some suspecting that there may be bots scalping them so they can be resold at exorbitant prices. A Tweet from the studio&#x27;s communications director Thomas Puha doesn&#x27;t deny this, stating that it is &quot;common at popular merch drops and restaurant bookings where bots are often used to do the buying&quot; without giving any assurance that genuine buyers will be protected from scalpers clearing stock. 




For those still itching to get their hands on one of the blue thermoses, you&#x27;ll have to wait until a restock, which won&#x27;t be coming until next year.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence has found its way into many industries, including gaming, and Take-Two is considering how it can leverage the technology. 


At the Paley International Council Summit on November 7, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed his views on AI and its impact on gaming. He has a mostly positive outlook, as Inverse reports, and he imagines how generative AI can be used to improve NPCs. 


If implemented correctly, it could give more variety to NPC dialogue. Zelnick argues that currently, scripted NPC dialogue can be quite boring, though with generative AI, &quot;you could imagine all the NPCs becoming really interesting and fun.&quot; The CEO believes that AI could be better than current solutions, though he is not so sure that it will be faster and cheaper. 


He does not mention much about Grand Theft Auto 6, which has generated quite a bit of excitement this week with the announcement of an incoming trailer. Though he does confirm that the next game in the franchise is in development, he doesn&#x27;t reveal additional information except that more news will come from Rockstar. We should get more information in December, which is when the trailer is due to drop. 


Take-Two&#x27;s latest quarterly earnings report reveals that Rockstar&#x27;s franchises are still going strong, with Red Dead Redemption 2 selling over 57 million and GTA 5 selling a stellar 190 million units.

It says right there in the patch notes: 



Balanced Garbage production and accumulation calculations


Fixed garbage truck accidentally adding garbage load when calculating garbage amount estimate for the path


Fixed garbage resource &quot;Trade value&quot; showing negative value in statistics



Wow, that’s some bad math going on! Thankfully, it’s maybe fixed.


So, I loaded up my city of Misery and started getting things going. I had some electricity problems, possibly related to small tweaks to the calculations, but I got it under control by connecting some new substations (I thought they were weirdly underutilized in…</span>

                              <span>When you let modders lose on PC games, you get a mishmash of all sorts of ideas. Starfield has already had Daleks added to its universe, and someone felt it was time for Doom to get the Doctor Who treatment as well.


Over on ModDB, user ZuGineeris has decided DoomGuy needed to take a break from battling demons and fight Daleks instead. Conceived as a &quot;semi-joke/novelty,&quot; the mod replaces all the enemies in classic Doom with the iconic Doctor Who robots.

The description says there are 20 varieties (including some rare ones) and over 400 sounds to boot. There&#x27;s not much more to be said about it. If you like Doom and legendary BBC sci-fi shows, this could be right up your alley.


Right up there


At the risk of making some readers feel very ancient (myself included), Doom is about to turn 30 years old. Released in December 1993, id Software&#x27;s influential FPS is still making waves in gaming to this day.


Okay, it&#x27;s obviously aged, but the fact that people are still tinkering with it, that the franchise is still going, and that people keep finding weird ways to play it to show what longevity really means (eat that, Skyrim).


Helping to pretty much cement the early days of the first-person shooter genre, PC gaming has never really been the same since. Doom is undeniably a classic, and whether you want Daleks in hell instead of monsters or you want it to sound more like Half-Life, there&#x27;s a mod for you out there somewhere.

Spider-Man 2&#x27;s sales have been nothing short of awe-inspiring, selling 2.5 million copies within its first 24 hours. In less than a month, it has managed to double that number. Insomniac isn&#x27;t done with the IP yet, and a patch has been recently released to fix minor performance issues. There has also been mention of a potential Venom spin-off, depending on what fans want.

Sony&#x27;s first-party titles are performing well


The announcement was posted on Twitter, though a more detailed second-quarter financial report gives more details regarding the performance of Sony&#x27;s gaming division. Spider-Man 2 isn&#x27;t the only game under Sony&#x27;s umbrella doing impressive numbers. 


The report reveals God of War Ragnarok has sold 11 million copies, while Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart has sold 1.1 million units. We also learn that the PS5 has sold 4.9 million units in the last quarter, bringing the console&#x27;s lifetime sales to a little over 46 million units. 


Spider-Man 2 has been a boon for Sony and there&#x27;ll be plenty more content next year for fans, as the Kraven the Hunter movie and an untitled Venom movie are scheduled for 2024.

                              <span>What&#x27;s in a name? There are a lot of video game titles that just evoke memories or conjure up the idea of quality. Half-Life is just one example. However, Valve&#x27;s first-ever game could easily have been called something else.


In a recent YouTube video from Valve level designer Dario Casali, it turns out Half-Life nearly wasn&#x27;t called Half-Life at all. Casali begins his developer commentary – as part of the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations – by showing a list of names that were suggested.




Of the most popular ones, titles like &quot;Dirt,&quot; &quot;Lead,&quot; &quot;Pressure Chamber,&quot; &quot;Screwed,&quot; and even &quot;Bent&quot; were bandied around. Perhaps most interestingly, in a runners-up list, the word &quot;Fallout&quot; can be seen, along with &quot;Adrenaline,&quot; &quot;Unstable Element,&quot; and even just &quot;Death.&quot;


Would have been a bit confusing


What&#x27;s also intriguing is that Half-Life is on this lower list, suggesting that it wasn&#x27;t even a popular name being suggested. As a side note, Casali believes the team should have called it Screwed, adding that &quot;it would have been amazing.&quot;


It also would have been interesting if the studio had gone with Fallout. Considering the actual Fallout game came out a year before HL, there&#x27;s a good chance there would have been some issues. Or at least some confusion.


The rest of this opening chapter of Casali&#x27;s playthrough is pretty good as well. He gives a bit of insight into what the purpose of the iconic monorail opening was, aside from setting the scene. We take it for granted these days, but Valve really wanted to show off new technologies, such as light shafts, scripted sequences, and new skeletal models, and this intro was a way to show these things off.

                              <span>If you have some *ahem* questionable games in your Steam library, an answer may soon be inbound. There&#x27;s a distinct possibility that the Valve client could introduce a feature that will allow you to hide some of your more embarrassing choices.


That&#x27;s according to a screenshot from SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik. The image shows a drop-down menu in Steam with an option to select &quot;Mark as Private.&quot; With such a feature, I can finally download Hatoful Boyfriend without fear of reprisal.




Of course, it should be mentioned that, at the time of writing, this has yet to be confirmed. However, given that this comes from SteamDB – a third-party site that chronicles all things related to Steam – I&#x27;m hopeful it will come to fruition.


Not here to judge


There are some, shall we say, less-than-chaste video games available through Steam&#x27;s vast library of choices. As such, it seems pretty clear that the (potential) ability to hide certain ones from your friends is almost certainly motivated by the same reason Microsoft created an option to hide files and folders on Windows.


There is, after all, an Adults Only tag in the client, so it&#x27;s not exactly a stretch to assume that – were such a feature to be implemented – there may be an uptick in people less shy about purchasing games of this nature. Whether it would also disable the pop-up that lets your friends know what you&#x27;ve just booted up remains to be seen.


As the head honcho of modern PC gaming, Steam is consistently being updated with everything from small backend tweaks to substantial UI overhauls. As such, some might argue that a &quot;porn hider&quot; is long overdue.

                              <span>During a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings conference call on November 8, CEO David Zaslav spoke at length about the future of Warner Bros. Games. 


Zaslav explains that gaming is the medium to focus on, as &quot;Gen Z and Gen Alpha prefer gaming to any other form of entertainment, more than social media, more than watching television or listening to music, more than going to the movie theater.&quot; 


Going forward, the company plans to transform its biggest franchises from PC and console launches with three four-year release schedules to feature more &quot;always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions.&quot; The ultimate aim is to have players spending more time on more platforms, which will in turn &quot;generate greater post-purchase revenue.&quot;

                              <span>Starfield&#x27;s cast of sidekicks includes cowboy dad Sam Coe voiced by Elias Toufexis, also known as the voice of Adam Jensen in Deus Exes Human Revolution and Mankind Divided. This wasn&#x27;t the role Toufexis was originally hired for, however. The actor revealed that he and fellow voice actress Cissy Jones, who voices romanceable party member Andreja, were originally hired to voice Starfield&#x27;s protagonist.

This particular model used to go for £1200, making it a nice £350 reduction.

                              <span>To quickly recap my Steam Deck OLED review, Valve’s refreshed handheld is brilliant, serving up major improvements to screen quality and battery life while making loads of little quality-of-life tweaks. Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?


Not quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want &quot;more, more, more&quot; rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

                              <span>While the Steam Deck OLED is awash with upgrades over the original handheld PC, it’s not a full replacement, and Valve still reckon that anyone wanting a proper Steam Deck 2 will be waiting a while. 
I was told as much on the Steam Deck’s first anniversary earlier this year, and according to Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, that stance won&#x27;t change once the Steam Deck OLED releases on November 16th. In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.

                              <span>I didn’t know the Steam Deck OLED existed until last week, and yet it’s essentially something I’ve wanted for nearly two years. As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.
Valve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.

It’s a &quot;definitive&quot; refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.

                              <span>For Vladimir Makarov, the babyfaced villain of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, trust and morale are irrelevant concepts. As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.


Instead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.

Erm.


Let&#x27;s start again. As you may know, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - not to be confused with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - is out from today, 9th November. Pre-ordering players and a few lucky journos (whom we absolutely don&#x27;t fear and resent for receiving copies early) have been able to play the campaign since 1st November, and the reactions and reviews thus far haven&#x27;t been great.

                              <span>When Kiryu&#x27;s tale &quot;ended&quot; in Yakuza 6, it left me in absolute tatters. A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn&#x27;t ever see his family again. Since then, we&#x27;ve had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii&#x27;s shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it&#x27;s a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu&#x27;s been up to this whole time.
But aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu&#x27;s epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza&#x27;s best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn&#x27;t the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.

Still, we can rest assured that it is finally &quot;content complete&quot;.

                              <span>“To be a good designer, you have to have very, very strong opinions,” says Slay The Spire design lead Anthony Giovannetti. “Show me a game designer who gives a thumbs-up to most things, and I suspect that’s probably someone who doesn’t have a very good game design sense. I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”
It’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.

                              <span>GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.
Zelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff.

Well, there it is. Nintendo has announced that not only is a Legend of Zelda movie a possibility, but it&#x27;s happening. Shigeru Miyamoto himself took to Twitter to share this news, stating that producer Avi Arad and director Wes Ball are already attached and it will be co-financed by Sony (a fact that we are still wrapping our heads around). Oh, and it is also going to be live-action. Let&#x27;s not forget that bit.
If this were to be announced as an animated film, we would be on board in a heartbeat (heck, we have dreamt about a Studio Ghibli or even Sony Pictures Animation, Spider-Verse take on the series for years now) but live-action cinema comes with its own set of challenges. What does a &#x27;real-life&#x27; Hyrule look like? Who really wants to see a realistically rendered Zora? And perhaps the most pressing issue of all: Who the heck do you cast in these beloved roles?

Publisher Neowiz has launched Sanabi for the Nintendo Switch, and it honestly looks pretty awesome.
It&#x27;s a pixel-art action platformer set in a Cyberpunk-inspired world with stunning neon lights and huge, imposing structures. You play as a legendary retired veteran called upon for one last job (no, not Solid Snake), and you&#x27;ll be wielding your chain-hook prostetic arm to swing across the environment and cut down your enemies.

The latest Japanese Charts are in, courtesy of Famitsu and Gematsu, and it&#x27;s another resounding victory for Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The platformer has shifted a further 108,449 copies to make up a cumulative 910,259. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to assume that the game will cross the 1,000,000 threshold by this time next week.
Elsewhere, We&#x27;ve got three newcomers in the form of Fashion Dreamer, WarioWare: Move It!, and Star Ocean: The Second Story R. Fashion Dreamer just managed to clinch the second spot this week, beating WarioWare by just 1,300 copies. Star Ocean, meanwhile, secured the fourth spot, missing out on number three by just 734 copies. It&#x27;s been an extremely close race, that&#x27;s for sure.

                              <span>Fine finale.
It feels like a lifetime ago since Nintendo announced that it would be expanding Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the Booster Course Pass, adding a total of 48 courses made up of revamped classics and brand-new additions. But does the expansion end with a bang or a whimper? Well, much like prior waves, we’d say this one lands somewhere in the middle, offering up a bunch of solid circuits mixed in with a few mildly disappointing ones.
Pretty much par for the course, then, but let’s just remind ourselves of what’s included with this one. You’ve got two new cups — the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup — made up of three Tour tracks and five ‘legacy’ courses from previous series entries. Oh, and you&#x27;ve four new characters to try out, too. More on those later.

It&#x27;s also identified a &quot;significant opportunity&quot; to generate greater post-purchase revenue&quot;.

                              <span>Expansion plan knocks it back to 2028.
Back in August, there was a report from Nikkei claiming Nintendo&#x27;s new development building had been delayed due to an &quot;expansion plan&quot;.
Nintendo didn&#x27;t officially comment about this at the time, but now within the slides of its latest financial results briefing, it&#x27;s confirmed construction has been up-scaled and is now scheduled to be completed by 2028 instead of 2027.

Atlus&#x27; new tactical RPG Persona 5 Tactica might not be out until next week, but there are apparently some lucky fans out there who have already been able to access and play the game.
As highlighted on social media and elsewhere, it seems the Steam version of the game has gone live a week ahead of its 17th November 2023 launch, enabling fans to check out the game much earlier than expected.

As the name implies, the device boasts an HDR OLED screen to produce more vibrant colors. It also boasts a larger battery for an increased charge – 30-50% more battery life depending on the game, with Valve pointing out that the OLED screen consumes less power.
The device also includes an updated and more efficient AMD APU and Wi-Fi 6E, resulting in downloads up to three times faster for increased bandwidth and lower latency. Steam Deck OLED also runs cooler thanks to its bigger fan and improved thermals. Overall, the device is 5% lighter than the original model.

Originally slated to release in 2021, the project has quietly remained in limbo for years, but developer Thekla Inc. has revealed that it’s finally arriving on April 30. 
Braid was first released for Xbox 360&#x27;s Live Arcade on August 6, 2008, and stars Tim, a boy searching for a princess captured by a monster. The 2D platformer centers on time manipulation mechanics that players utilize to solve puzzles and locate/assemble jigsaw pieces. The strong mechanics combined with its contemplative writing made Braid a critical hit, with many hailing it as a masterpiece.

                              <span>Sony announced it was acquiring Destiny 2 maker Bungie for $3.6 billion in January of 2022. A week later, in a quarterly financial results briefing, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation planned to launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026, with Bungie helping the company in the space. In an earnings call held today, Totoki stated that of its 12 live service games, it will only release six by Fiscal Year 2025, which ends March 2026, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Bungie was evaluating some of PlayStation&#x27;s in-development offerings, including Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us multiplayer project, which is reportedly on ice. It seems that evaluation has led to Sony retooling its approach as the company has delayed at least six liv…</span>

It turns out plenty of others enjoyed developer Insomniac Games&#x27; latest superhero effort, too, because Sony has revealed that in just 11 days, it sold through more than 5 million copies, making it one of the year&#x27;s best-selling games.
For context, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 outsold Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which is the fastest-selling Super Mario game after selling through 4.3 million copies in two weeks. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 was named the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game just three days after its release, too. 
Woo! We&#x27;re incredibly honored to announce Marvel&#x27;s #SpiderMan2PS5 has sold over 5 MILLION COPIES!

                              <span>Earlier this summer, amid an incoming typhoon, Game Informer visited the Bandai Hobby Center Shinkan, the 132,000-square-foot factory where the entertainment company manufactures its iconic Gundam model kits. If you purchase a new Gundam model kit at your local store today, it originated in this facility in Shizuoka, Japan. The factory contains 35 plastic color-molding machines – 25 electric and 10 hydraulic – all helping produce millions of models yearly.
Bandai Spirits employee Miyuki Nakagiri, the subject matter expert on how exactly the factory operates, escorts us through the building. Our translator during this tour is Atsuo Yoshimura, a video game production manager who’s worked at Bandai Namco for the last 17 years. Notably, Yoshimura worked on last year’s Elden Ring – Game Informer’s 2022 Game of the Year, and most recently, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon. Additionally, Yoshimura was instrumental in helping to coordinate Game Informer’s recent Armored Core VI cover story trip.

Police say they seized luxury cars, silver bars, cryptocurrency and cash. Other crimes that make the prosecution much more intriguing are mentioned in much less detail.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Core i5 12600KF is one of the company&#x27;s best value gaming CPUs, and today it&#x27;s down to $155 at Walmart (fulfilled via Newegg) versus its standard price of $220. 
This chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. 
For reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice?

                              <span>As regular readers of this column will know, I&#x27;m a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. 
It normally retails for around £929, but today it&#x27;s down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That&#x27;s about as cheap as we&#x27;ve ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes.

Having built yourself a no-name crim, you galloped around cranking out cash and XP by means of glorified sidequests handed down by headliners such as Lamar. Skip forward to 2023, and as Alice0 observed when we discussed Rockstar&#x27;s GTA 6 announcements this morning, GTA Online is effectively an MMO with ten years of updates, expansions and community projects under its belt.

The rumoured closure comes just two years after the veteran British label were resurrected by their original founders to work on a new TimeSplitters game.

                              <span>Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.
Today, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.

                              <span>If there&#x27;s one genre I&#x27;ve never quite had the reflexes or spatial awareness for, it&#x27;s the bullet hell shooter. I&#x27;ve long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It&#x27;s not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent&#x27;s attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It&#x27;s very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it.

                              <span>Last time, you narrowly decided that soulslike bloodstains are better than ghosts walking through walls. That sounds to me like the decisions of cowards who not only don&#x27;t want to be got by ghosts, they want to be warned about the presence of any danger. Maybe I&#x27;m being ungenerous; maybe what you truly enjoy is watching other people get extremely ghostgot. I cannot deny it is great to watch someone absolutely stack it. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between two automatic assists. What&#x27;s better: auto-level up, or auto-detect graphics settings?

The next game from developer Arbitrary Metric, Roman Sands RE:Build, is... very different, at least on the surface.


The first Act of the new Steam demo sees you staggering onto the beach below some kind of tropical resort. You wander up past the pools to the cavernous lobby and are immediately set upon by haggard guests, who appear to think you&#x27;re a member of staff. So you become a member of staff, fetching margaritas, tracking down the check-in ledger and running downstairs to adjust the boiler settings. You earn XP from quests towards employee ranks that unlock useful items at vending machines. And you try to work out what you&#x27;re doing here, and why everybody&#x27;s so terrified of the sun. I haven&#x27;t deciphered the mystery yet.

This is Mass Effect 5, actual title possibly Mass Effect: Epsilon - &quot;epsilon&quot; being the Top Secret Codename of this hidden page on the Mass Effect website. What does it all mean? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a nice coat, though, isn&#x27;t it? I like those padded red lapels.

                              <span>October 2019 saw the launch of action-platformer Valfaris, and now the sequel has a date. Side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up Valfaris: Mecha Therion is coming to PC on November 21, 2023, with consoles to follow later. 


Developer Steel Mantis is doing the best thing you can do to a protagonist with this one: Give them a massive robot. The story of Valfaris: Mecha Therion is pretty much covered in the subtitle. Therion continues his hunt for the evil Lord Vroll, only this time he takes the opportunity to bust out the secret weapon known as Mecha Therion. Thus, the follow-up is ready to fire away with a move from hectic, Contra-esque running and gunning to pure shooting action. 


You can see how they changed things as Therion suits up in the release date trailer:




If the mighty sword he wields wasn&#x27;t enough of a hint, there are still melee moves to master. Mecha Therion has Melee, Ballistic, and Destroyer class weapons, and your loadout can be configured with a variety of weapon combinations. Further add-ons and weapon upgrades are acquired by earning Blood Metal. 


If the actual lore of Valfaris is something you can&#x27;t resist, publisher Big Sugar Games promises a &quot;deeper dive&quot; in the days leading up to this month&#x27;s launch. After its arrival on PC, Valfaris: Mecha Therion will make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Gearbox Publishing celebrated 10 years of Risk of Rain today with an announcement for Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds, a free-to-play action RPG roguelike for mobile devices.


The game looks to bring the usual fast-paced, run-and-gun combat of Risk of Rain to a new perspective. Hostile Worlds uses an isometric camera to display the action. The mobile RPG also embraces the new changes visually, showcasing a more cartoon-ish style with chibi-esque Survivors and perhaps even animated cutscenes. Gearbox notes that Hostile Worlds includes a lot of familiar characters and foes while staying true to the series&#x27; lore.




Risk of Rain mobile charges into battle with more Survivors


Beyond the look and new angle, the big takeaway is that this mobile Risk of Rain will let you swap characters on the fly. The game lets you pick three Survivors you can change while in &quot;mid-combat to exploit enemy vulnerabilities.&quot; It sounds like your odds of survival will only improve by unlocking the best Survivors who complement your team&#x27;s playstyle. There will also be co-op support for you and up to three others. 


But even that might not help. The publisher promises that Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will still be pretty tough with &quot;heart-pounding bullet-hell gameplay&quot; and &quot;colossal adversaries.&quot;





Naturally, since this is a F2P mobile game, there will be some live-service trappings. Neither Gearbox nor developer Frima Games makes mention of what their free-to-play model looks like yet. But the game will feature &quot;continuous&quot; updates to keep &quot;the fun rolling.&quot; I expect we&#x27;ll see new Survivors and items getting piped into some in-game store. Gearbox hasn&#x27;t yet revealed any costs, and the game&#x27;s release date is still up in the air.


There is a website, though, and signing up for the newsletter will unlock a Survivor called Mercenary during the game&#x27;s launch. Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.

Bethesda is allowing Starfield&#x27;s most interested and impatient players to get a taste of things to come with the beta. It brings Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS technology along with a few choice fixes and changes. And yes, that includes the ability to eat those iconic Starfield sandwiches right off the floor. Like a filthy Spacer.


How to join the Starfield DLSS update Steam beta


The DLSS update will not install automatically for Starfield the moment you check your Steam library. As this is a beta, you need to opt into it and download a new build of the game. To play the beta, open up your Steam library and right-click on Starfield. Select &#x27;Properties&#x27; and move to the &#x27;Betas&#x27; window. In the…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s nothing worse than swinging in New York City and having all that momentum slam to a halt after getting stuck in a wall. Thankfully, the latest update for Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 fixes some troublesome clipping issues and a bug that could corrupt your save file.


The latter issue is clearly the larger concern. Thankfully, according to the notes released by developer Insomniac Games, the bug appears only in a very specific situation. And there&#x27;s only one such bug listed with the update. A majority of the fixes cover collision problems, getting stuck on objects, or clipping through or into things. For some, Spider-Man would warp through the ground like Nightcrawler and fall forever into the screaming void. The patch should hopefully fix it. Hopefully.

Spider-Man 2 update fixes the infamous &#x27;Spider-Box&#x27; once again


The Spider-Man 2 update includes five fixes for clipping issues. It addresses situations where you can get stuck while running on a wall or clip through the world while in combat. There&#x27;s also a fix for one issue that I had to deal with. While playing the Coney Island story mission, I had Peter Parker sit on a bench that must have been coated with glue. He wouldn&#x27;t stand up, and I had to restart a checkpoint. If this happened to you, the update should fix it. 


The patch also corrects the model-loading issue, of which the character turns into a white box. And if you&#x27;ve checked the game&#x27;s subreddit, the bug is not as uncommon as you&#x27;d think. It may have even happened once to yours truly. 


I had fun with it. Screenshot by Destructoid


There are other issues addressed by the update. Missions should no longer randomly fail if you have the HUD removed. The game should also count the number of correct flips if you&#x27;re going for the Hang Ten trophy. Check out the full list to learn more.

                              <span>To encourage inactive players to return to Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix is hosting a Callback Campaign again. These occur now and again as an incentive for any who bounced off to return with encouragement from friends. This one begins today, November 8, and ends on December 14, 2023.


In FFXIV, Callback Campaigns work by having an active player invite a friend to return. These can be anyone from a free company or a player on the friends list. 


Assuming the invited player accepts the invitation and returns, both parties receive a few benefits. Players who send the invitation receive five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Players use these to obtain dyes and mounts like the dragon Twintania. 


Those who return to Eorzea play free for 14 days and also receive 99 Aetheryte Tickets for free fast travel. They also get 10 Silver Chocobo Feathers, which are good to exchange for two pieces of new gear. 


Some restrictions do apply. The most notable is that lapsed players need to be inactive for 90 days. Another is that players sending invitations can only receive their reward once, meaning even if multiple friends accept an invitation, the sender still only receives five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Square Enix even recommends participating in other programs to gain more feathers. 


For anyone who has an active FFXIV membership and wants an old friend to return, this could be a good incentive, especially with some additional rewards. Two free weeks to catch up with FFXIV&#x27;s patch content also doesn&#x27;t sound like a bad deal for lapsed players because while FFXIV is wonderful, subscription fees add up over time. 


It&#x27;s why, despite loving the MMO, I haven&#x27;t played for roughly two years. Hopefully, players like me who are invited use this as a perfect opportunity to jump in and squeeze all they can from the free weeks.

Updated with the world&#x27;s greatest detective&#x27;s newest adventure on Switch, Murder On The Orient Express, along with our favourite coffee-loving yellow mouse, Detective Pikachu Returns!

Everyone loves a good mystery, and even more so if they&#x27;re the one who gets to solve it. The detective genre has evolved a great deal since its point-and-click adventure game roots, and this list proves how much things have changed. In fact, the games that we&#x27;re including in this list range from typical noir detective fare to the kinds of games that you&#x27;ll probably tell us &quot;don&#x27;t count as detective games&quot; in the comments!

GameChops and music artist Funk Fiction have released Sonic &amp; Chill, a relaxing new addition to the &#x27;&amp; Chill&#x27; album series featuring multiple tunes from classic Sonic games.
Comprised of 14 tracks in total, you&#x27;ve got the likes of Chemical Plant Zone, Welcome to Station Square, and Hydrocity Zone to accompany you while you work, relax, or even excerise, if that&#x27;s your thing. A physical vinyl release is in works for relase in the coming months, but you can now listen to the whole thing on streaming services.

In yet another blow to the gaming industry, VGC has reported that Embracer Group may soon be closing the Nottingham-based UK studio Free Radical Design.
The team was reformed back in 2021 to revive the classic FPS franchise Timesplitters, but it looks like that may now be under threat as a result of Embracer Group&#x27;s ongoing restructuring programme.

Our resident reviewer extraordinaire, PJ O&#x27;Reilly, awarded it 8/10 in his review, saying this entry is &quot;as daft and colourful as ever.&quot; Putting aside a focus on multiplayer that might disappoint lone players, &quot;it&#x27;s really hard to knock the chaotically silly vibe of this most excellent party game.&quot;

Developer and publisher Giants Software has announced Farming Simulator Kids for the Nintendo Switch, offering a more child-friendly, accesible take on its long-running Farming Simulator franchise.
Switching out text for more audiovisual cues, Farming Simulator Kids will require players to harvest crops, care for a variety of different animals, and make use of numerous John Deer-manufactured vehicles. Mini-games will break up the gameplay nicely, so kids will be able to hop in and out as they please.

                              <span>Flashy façade.
Fashion Dreamer, the newest release from the developer (Syn Sophia) of the cult classic Style Savvy games, garnered high expectations from fans hoping to find a spiritual successor to the series. While Fashion Dreamer is not technically part of the Style Savvy family (known as &#x27;Style Boutique&#x27; in Europe), it offers fans of those DS and 3DS games an opportunity to take their fashion expertise to Nintendo Switch.
Unfortunately, Fashion Dreamer’s gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. At the beginning, we are welcomed into a virtual world called Eve, where we play as an influencer putting together outfits for NPCs and even other players if utilizing the online mode. The majority of the game is spent creating outfits, called &#x27;look-its,&#x27; for characters that are spaced out across a small map, called a &#x27;cocoon.&#x27; Each character wants their outfit to meet specific criteria, like featuring a certain color, including a clothing item such as a jacket, or having a particular vibe such as being “cool” or “unique.”

In typical Nintendo fashion, the company unexpectedly and nonchalantly dropped the announcement last night that it is deep into development on a Legend of Zelda movie with Sony Pictures.
It comes as no massive shock given the success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, but the fact that this Zelda adaptation will be a live-action film project (as opposed to, say, an animated feature or a Limited Series) has provoked a variety of reactions around Nintendo Life Towers.

                              <span>Nintendo isn&#x27;t quite ready to say goodbye to the Switch, its second best-selling console ever. According to a new financial briefing from the company, it plans to support the Switch seemingly long after the release of rumored new-gen hardware expected to launch next year. 
It&#x27;s been a big week for Nintendo, with the company revealing that Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the fastest-selling Super Mario game in the series and that a live-action Legend of Zelda movie is on the way. We also learned yesterday the Switch has surpassed 132 million units sold on the heels of great results for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. Now, Nintendo has pulled back the curtains a bit on its approach to the Switch platform moving forward. 


&quot;Nintendo Switch will be entering its eighth year…</span>

                              <span>Rockstar Games will release the first trailer for its highly anticipated sequel to 2013&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V, which became the most profitable entertainment product of all time in 2018, next month. As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. 
Official news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. 
We are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.
November 8, 2023
Game Informer has reached out to Rockstar&#x27;s parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. 
The journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. 


While waiting to learn more about Rockstar&#x27;s next game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

Benson reveals on his personal X account that he’s been suffering severe heart failure over the past 12 months, which has greatly limited his ability to work. You can read his post below.

                              <span>Today, Ubisoft is the latest developer to join 2023&#x27;s wave of layoffs. According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company&#x27;s Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.


&quot;These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,&quot; the company told both IGN and Kotaku. &quot;We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.&quot; Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to &quot;to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.&quot;
This news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that&#x27;s in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.
Ubisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.

                              <span>At Apple&#x27;s keynote event last September, everyone expected them to announce the new iPhone, but nobody expected them to announce that multiple Resident Evil games would be headed to the device. Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. 

The game won&#x27;t be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you&#x27;ll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you&#x27;re a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you&#x27;re on the go.
The game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven&#x27;t been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.</span>

When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn&#x27;t without its faults, it&#x27;s a more-than-worthy follow-up.

                              <span>Lords of the Fallen, the spiritual successor to 2014&#x27;s Soulslike with the same name, hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last month – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review here. After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. 
The roadmap also includes a &quot;regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience.&quot; 


Stopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year&#x27;s end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says &quot;players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community.&quot; 
&quot;At Hexworks, we&#x27;re incredibly proud of the open relationship we&#x27;re fostering with our community,&quot; studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. &quot;We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre&#x27;s boundaries.&quot;

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment launched Alan Wake 2, its Alan Wake sequel 13 years in the making, last month to the delight of both critics and fans – you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review here. Since its October 27 release, Remedy has released three updates, including its biggest yet last week, for the game so far. And now, a fourth update is live and while it&#x27;s one of the smallest yet, it fixes a few key issues.


Alan Wake 2 Update 1.0.9 
PlayStation 5: Update 1.00.09
Xbox Series X/S: Update 1.0.0.9
PC: Update 1.0.9
Xbox Series – A workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.
Room 665 – Fixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  
Local Girl – Fixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.
And that&#x27;s everything in the latest Alan Wake 2 update. Catch up on everything the Alan Wake 2 update from last week fixed with the game here. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 review and then check out this update where Remedy discusses its development progress on Control 2 and its Max Payne remakes. After that, read this feature about the characters to remember before starting Alan Wake 2, and then check out what the best graphics modes are in the game.

                              <span>The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo&#x27;s best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. 
This news comes from Nintendo&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company&#x27;s best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. 


It&#x27;s possible the Switch reaches the DS&#x27; numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn&#x27;t end sales of the hardware. And consider…</span>

                              <span>Mechanical gaming keyboards used to be premium options available to very few, but now they often go on sale for extremely low prices - even from big names. Today HyperX joins that list of big-name bargains with their Alloy Origins full-size mechanical keyboard dropping to just $32 when bought from GameStop in the US, versus its original price of $109.99. That&#x27;s a great bargain for a keyboard with red (soft linear) mechanical switches, optional RGB lighting and a high-quality metal chassis.

                              <span>The open world co-op survival game I liked most was Wurm Online, in which every action was performed via a right-click menu and we needed a town meeting to discuss who would spend the hours necessary to flatten a small patch of land. 

I therefore look at co-op survival game Enshrouded, with its voxel building, grapple hooks, wingsuits, and think: pah, what tomfoolery. This looks fun. Not at all my sort of thing. It might be yours, though. It&#x27;s now got a January 24th release date and a new trailer, below.

The word &quot;anacrusis&quot; refers to a set of syllables that precede the first metrical foot in a line of poetry - an intriguing moniker for a game that is essentially Valve&#x27;s Left 4 Dead, but set in a 1970s-styled high tech facility reminiscent of No One Lives Forever. I&#x27;ll be honest, I haven&#x27;t been keeping up with The Anacrusis, and assumed that it was one of those top-drawer philosophical puzzlers. Come on, there isn&#x27;t even a pun in the title!

                              <span>Hello folks. I know we&#x27;ve barely broken out of spooky season, but over in the RPS Treehouse we&#x27;re rapidly preparing to warm up our vocal chords and bellow &quot;It&#x27;s CHRIIIIIIIISTMASSSSSS&quot; from the rooftops in the spirit of Slade&#x27;s seasonal epic. That&#x27;s right. Advent Calendar season is upon us, and we&#x27;ll be voting for our favourite games of the year very shortly. So I thought I&#x27;d use this month&#x27;s Letter From The Editor to give you a little behind the scenes glimpse of how we&#x27;ll be doing this in the coming weeks, and how we generally go about putting it all together every year.

Ah wait, jewel in the crown! - is new 64-player map The Reclamation of Montcrux, in which the rampaging Agathians attempt to overrun a fort held by the Tenosians, pitting petard against bombard, battering ram against ballista. 


Gosh, that&#x27;s a lot of medieval words. The translation is that one side has to run up the hill screaming while the other side lobs big balls of fire at them. Bash your way into the castle and you&#x27;ll be able to stop the aforesaid rain of fireballs, though you&#x27;ll still have to worry about getting dinged upside the headbone by dudes in plate. Onward, friends to the next paragraph! We have nothing to lose but our limbs!

                              <span>Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, &quot;We&#x27;re here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy.&quot; I can almost see Croteam&#x27;s writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot&#x27;s eyes. You&#x27;re not fooling me, Croteam. I&#x27;m here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can&#x27;t stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. 
Millenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be &#x27;born&#x27; into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we&#x27;re living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.

They&#x27;ve organised pickets outside BioWare Edmonton&#x27;s offices in Canada, and are calling on BioWare fans to get involved on social media, while trying to engage current BioWare staff in conversation about unionisation.

První tři roky byla rozdělená na Core, základ distribuce, který spravovali zaměstnanci Red Hatu, a Extras, který obsahoval balíčky spravované komunitou. V roce 2007 s vydáním Fedory 7 došlo ke sloučení repozitářů do jednoho, na kterém se bez rozdílu podílí jak zaměstnanci Red Hatu, tak komunitní přispěvatelé. Tento model funguje dodnes.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.
An announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”
While a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.
Microsoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform&#x27;s then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. 
What do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed that the first expansion for Diablo IV is called Vessel of Hatred, and it hits the game late next year. The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. 
During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. &quot;Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu.&quot; 
Check out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Blizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class &quot;never seen before in the Diablo universe.&quot; 
And that&#x27;s all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV&#x27;s first expansion is due out in late 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won&#x27;t be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard. Read about the ongoing Diablo IV Season of Blood after that.

Lightning McQueen is also an extra special release.

Like in the Cars Pixar franchise, Lightning McQueen will look around the pitch while you cruise the Arena, narrow his eyes as you focus his speed, and react with each score. &quot;With the Lightning McQueen Mega Bundle, you&#x27;ll be able to play as three different versions of the Route 66 icon,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;First up is the Rust-eze Decal.

                              <span>Blizzard Entertainment has revealed the next three heroes of Overwatch 2, including Mauga, a new duel-wielding tank hero that hits the game next month. Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. 
Mauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he&#x27;s already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2&#x27;s Season 8 launch on December 5. &quot;Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power,&quot; Blizzard says about the hero. 
Watch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: 


Here are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: 

Elsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: 
The second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it&#x27;s the hero we&#x27;re expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. 
The final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here&#x27;s a look at Hanaoka below:

As far as pitches go, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, the next game in what used to be called the Yakuza series, is hard to beat: Find out what happened to series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma between Yakuza 6: The Song of Life and Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The former ended with Kiryu faking his death to keep his adopted family of orphans safe. The idea was his story was over – he was moving on to the next chapter of his life. Developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio pitched it as such. Until the latter, when he …</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, we spent time with tha ltd. and Enhance Experience, the creative teams behind Humanity, for a documentary on the game&#x27;s development.
While, on its surface, Humanity is a puzzle game about leading groups of people to a goal, as its name implies, its story wrestles with ideas of what it means to be human, the nature of groups, and why we always seem to resort to violence. Humanity&#x27;s story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we&#x27;re currently on.
Watch The Documentary:


&quot;Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,&quot; Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. &quot;There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, &#x27;What is humanity? What is human nature?&#x27; We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It&#x27;s like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we&#x27;re trying to depict in Humanity.&quot;
Watch above or over on Game Informer&#x27;s YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. &quot;Violence Is Inevitable&quot; speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project&#x27;s origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.</span>

                              <span>Epic Games launched Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017 and if you followed the game back then, you likely know that every other week, there was news that Fortnite had its biggest day ever in terms of player count and other impressive metrics. Now, more than six years later, Fortnite has had its biggest day ever again, bringing in 44.7 million players and 102 million hours of play on Saturday, November 4. 
Epic Games tweeted this record over the weekend, calling it the biggest day in Fortnite&#x27;s history before thanking Fortnite and OG players.
Way to start things off with a big bang 💥
#FortniteOG. Yesterday was the biggest day in Fortnite’s history with over 44.7 MILLION players jumping in and 102 MILLION hours of play.
November 5, 2023
As for why, Epic doesn&#x27;t list a specific reason but it&#x27;s pretty clear it&#x27;s because of the new season itself. Dubbed Season OG, a short one-month-long season of Fortnite brings players back to the Chapter 1 map for some throwback battle royale nostalgia. Plus, near-weekly updates will take players on a journey from Chapter 1: Season 5 all the way to Chapter 1: Season X. 
Check out Game Informer&#x27;s breakdown of everything you need to know about Fortnite&#x27;s Season OG. After that, check out the first official throwback teaser Epic released and then watch this nostalgic Tilted Towers video.

In a game where play time counts can end up in the hundreds of hours, that’s a fairly terrifying prospect.

As it turns out, with the old map and items came a whole lot of players, setting a new all-time concurrent player record for the multiplayer shooter that surpasses even its previous heights in the pop-culture zeitgeist.

                              <span>Cryptic Studios, the makers of MMOs including Star Trek Online and Dungeons &amp; Dragons MMORPG Neverwinter, have confirmed a number of layoffs due to the ongoing “comprehensive restructuring” of megacorp owner Embracer Group. The “personnel changes” at Cryptic make them the latest Embracer-owned developer to suffer job losses in what continues to be an unrelenting year for thousands of those working in video games.

                              <span>Much like Weyland-Yutani linking arms with Skynet, Microsoft have teamed up with Inworld to bring the latter&#x27;s &quot;generative AI&quot; tools to Xbox studios. This &quot;multi-year co-development partnership&quot; will &quot;build a powerful toolkit that harnesses artificial intelligence to enrich the narrative and character creation elements of game development&quot;, according to Inworld CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn. You might recognise Inworld as the tech used by that GTA 5 mod about AI cultists in which characters speak AI-generated dialogue, which Rockstar blocked from distribution over the summer. Suffice to say that Microsoft have grander plans for it.

                              <span>When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it&#x27;s Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.


Thus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek&#x27;s PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community&#x27;s ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.

                              <span>While reviewing Cities Colon Skylines 2, I didn&#x27;t actually go in that hard on public transport (beyond providing it and making it free), despite the urge. Since then though, it&#x27;s become a game where I don&#x27;t so much build a single mega-city as a series of experiments.
Naturally, those experiments devolved from a noble effort to remove the stain of cars into a sadistic urge to drive thousands of my own people on a never-ending hell march.

                              <span>Hello folks. A small bit of RPS Game Club news today. Since it&#x27;s starting to get toward end of the year season, Game Club will be taking a short break for the next two months. That means we won&#x27;t be running it this month (November), or next month (December). We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.
In the meantime, though, we hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this first year&#x27;s outing of the RPS Game Club, and we&#x27;d love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year. Regardless of whether you&#x27;re a regular Game Clubber or have only ever watched it from afar, please come and join in the discussion below to help us make it even better.

                              <span>In 2021, Twitter user Thomas Violence, an Australian podcaster who was working in a bar at the time, recounted that a 19-year-old had asked for a refund on their drink because they realised they were too drunk already. One of the early replies was an &quot;ummm actually,&quot; pointing out that you had to be 21 to buy booze in most states, and Thomas Violence responded &quot;I&#x27;m one of the dozens of people worldwide that live in a country that&#x27;s not America&quot;. I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach &quot;Zach Gage&quot; Gage.
Puzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I&#x27;ve not subbed because I&#x27;m just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.

                              <span>Mad dashes, daring escapes, last minute reversals: these are some of my favourite moments in multiplayer shooters. It’s exhilarating to scream towards the chopper in Left 4 Dead or a dropship in Titanfall. 

The Finals is a multiplayer shooter that seems to take place entirely at this elevated pitch. In the dozens of open beta matches I&#x27;ve played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been kicking doors, clicking on shoes to walk, running along walls, and fiddling with buttons on a television in space. Come check out these attractive and interesting indie games, and more!

                              <span>Devolver have released a Let&#x27;s Play for robo-philosophical puzzler The Talos Principle 2 in which the Let&#x27;s Player is GLaDOS, nemesis of Valve&#x27;s Portal games, with which The Talos Principle has a few things in common. They&#x27;ve brought on original Portal voice actress Ellen McClain to narrate the footage, and the result is genuinely quite funny. As you&#x27;d expect, GlaDOS isn&#x27;t that impressed by Croteam&#x27;s work. I score this a 7/10 on the Hoot And/Or Holler scale.

Specifically it says &quot;fan favourite character, Pyramid Head, makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.&quot; That&#x27;s pretty much all she wrote, where the much vaunted &quot;news-reporting&quot; aspect of this news article is concerned.

                              <span>In October we revealed details of a DMCA subpoena application filed by Naver Webtoon in the United States which listed over 350 &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains offering the company&#x27;s comics illegally. Late last week, Naver suggested that after obtaining site operators&#x27; personal details from Cloudflare, around 150 sites with 2.5 billion annual visits subsequently shut down. While that&#x27;s a huge claim, just one of those sites accounted for three quarters of a billion visits.

                              <span>PropellerAds has filed a scathing response to an MPA submission to the USTR which labeled the advertising company a notorious &#x27;piracy&#x27; market. The movie industry group relies on a baseless, inaccurate, and misleading report, PropellerAds argues, equating MPA&#x27;s practices to harassment and defamation.

What&#x27;s clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank.

                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s first expansion will arrive sometime late in spaceyear 2024, but it&#x27;s also a throwback to Diablo 2.

                              <span>&quot;The game is called Bloodthyrster X,&quot; the nerd-coded detective explains, twisting in their ill-fitting suit and furiously shaking an upside-down Xbox controller while their colleagues stare aghast at a TV screen looping a three-second clip of shoddy CGI ultraviolence. &quot;The objective is to run over babies in your minivan while shooting cops and other players. It&#x27;s taking over the dark web... and IRL.&quot;
You don&#x27;t need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I&#x27;m going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks.

                              <span>Readers, I must tell you something. If you&#x27;re currently playing Alan Wake 2 and haven&#x27;t continued with Alan&#x27;s part of the story after reaching the point where you can switch between him and Saga, STOP WHAT YOU&#x27;RE DOING IMMEDIATELY. 
I know Saga&#x27;s an infinitely better hang than Alan, but trust me on this. You are ignoring what is arguably the best 15 minutes of video game you&#x27;ll play all year. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and play as Saga for 20 hours, only to realise that this utter masterpiece of a level was sitting here the entire time. Do the right thing. Continue Alan&#x27;s story. You won&#x27;t regret it (and spoilers to follow below, obvs).

                              <span>What a great little thing. You&#x27;ve surely seen a hundred post-Minecraft games about building a base to smelt iron to build a base, and probably even thought to yourself that they look entirely fine but kind of... redundant? There&#x27;s only so many times you can walk back and forth from a cave to a forge.
But what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It&#x27;s so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.


Over the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.

I headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?

Released today, it gives you a massive, gloomy map full of towering, greeny-black Gothic structures that are packed with backstory documents, but contain absolutely no enemies. The only thing separating you from all that winding, lore-drenched architecture is distance. Check out the trailer below.

                              <span>I have a confession to make, readers. I&#x27;m mildly obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I&#x27;m kinda obsessed with Starfield&#x27;s food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I&#x27;m weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid&#x27;s size cartons with a little straw on the side. 
Chunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I&#x27;ve ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let&#x27;s be honest, I&#x27;m all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that&#x27;s been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity&#x27;s sake (it&#x27;s the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it&#x27;s also exactly the kind of thing I&#x27;d swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can&#x27;t even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year&#x27;s Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.

                              <span>Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man&#x27;s first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up 23 years later.

                              <span>Earlier this year, HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. 
Deadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. 


&quot;We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,&quot; Mazin told Deadline. &quot;[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we&#x27;re greenlit proper, we&#x27;re a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.&quot;
Considering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it&#x27;s clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We&#x27;re all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won&#x27;t happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG goes live in a few hours once its downtime is complete, and it brings players back to 2018&#x27;s Chapter 1 map, with throwback weapons, loot, vehicles, and more, too. While it&#x27;s technically Season 5 of Fortnite Chapter 4, which follows the previous Last Resort season, developer Epic Games is calling it Season OG, and it makes sense considering how much of Fortnite 2018 is making an appearance.
The throwback nostalgia continues throughout the season because each new update brings with it a different phase of Fortnite Chapter 1&#x27;s past, starting with Season 5. That means weapons like the Assault Rifle and Pump Shotgun, and vehicles like Shopping Carts, will be featured in both Zero Build and regular Battle Royale Fortnite.

WarioWare: Move It is full of truly surprising games that take advantage of the Switch&#x27;s unique control options, but it&#x27;s arguably always the most fun to see what retro Nintendo games make it into any WarioWare collection.

RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawe…</span>

                              <span>Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.


But such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve many a Halloweeny game to recommend to you (Saturnalia, Hob&#x27;s Barrow, Wytchwood, World Of Horror and even, I suppose, Alan Wake 2, although I&#x27;m sort of enjoying it in the wrong way to think of it as a Halloween apropos game) but I&#x27;m short on recommendations for myself. I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.
I want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest. If I hadn&#x27;t played The Tartarus Key already I&#x27;d be playing that, is what I&#x27;m saying. But the other day I played the demo for An English Haunting and it&#x27;s exactly what I want. It&#x27;s just not going to be out for a while. Rats!

                              <span>Mobile-based interactive drama Silent Hill: Ascension is quite the thing, and is getting quite the reception. The cleanest summary I can manage is that developer Genvid and publisher Konami have launched a very bad streaming service dedicated to dunking on Silent Hill, with microtransaction-fuelled voting mechanics and a chatbox awash with 10 years of pent-up fan resentment and confusing references to James Sunderland&#x27;s genitals.

                              <span>While Rishi Sunak bundles nerds into Bletchley Park, we at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are investigating the real danger of AI: somewhat rubbish text-to-speech voicelines making The Finals less fun. We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow &quot;THE KING FISH&quot; for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.


Plus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth?

                              <span>I played a demo of Scene Investigators over the most recent Steam Next Fest, and was interested enough that I wanted to have a go with the full release. It&#x27;s billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to everyone. It&#x27;s quite hard. But! Some people will really like it.

                              <span>The android is unresponsive, standing frozen mid-step with one foot off the ground. I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.
Using a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.

                              <span>Stand RoboCop: Rogue City next to other FPS games in a police line-up, and you&#x27;ll quickly notice the difference. This big guy is clunky, boxy, and has insane system requirements devoted to creating dazzling reflections. However, stand it next to other RoboCop games (maybe even the movies?) and it suddenly looks like a masterpiece in chrome. This is a filmic and faithful adaptation that&#x27;s likely to get instant fan approval, but didn&#x27;t leave my shooty thumbs that impressed.

                              <span>There comes a point when adding yet another behemothic RPG to your collection of unfinished, behemothic RPGs ceases to be a mark of eccentricity and becomes an act of manifest self-hatred. I, for instance, have just activated a beta code for 100-hour levelling fest Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader even as I make a mental note that really, I&#x27;ve got to make some proper headway in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 this evening.
For The King 2, at least, seems pretty trim and digestible at a reported 30 hours in length. Released out of early access today, it&#x27;s a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat.

                              <span>What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. 

Yet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means.

Then came FENTON!, a hunter-trickster spirit forsaken by Christ. Perhaps next will be ROY! The upcoming first-person survival horror game Rotten Flesh will invite you to shout the name of your lost dog into your microphone, hoping that Roy will bark back to let you know where he is. Fun fact: other, nondog things will hear you shouting too. Have a peek in the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>Larian have released a new Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 update, Patch 4, which applies 1000 fixes and changes to the indecently expansive fantasy RPG - far too many to list on Steam. The most significant additions  are accessibility settings for colour-blind people, the ability to visually customise hirelings upon recruitment, and the ability to clean up party members using sponges and soap, rather than lobbing bottles of water at them. No more rocking up to cutscenes looking like Sweeney Todd on his lunchbreak! Well, unless that&#x27;s your vibe.

That&#x27;s because all digital version preorders unlock early access to the Modern Warfare III campaign. That&#x27;s eight days before the full release on November 10, which is when its multiplayer suite goes live. Earlier this week, publisher Activision Blizzard and developer Sledgehammer Games released the PC specs and system requirements for the game. Now, we have our hands on Modern Warfare III and can tell you what the best graphics mode is on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and what visual settings to use.

                              <span>Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4 has been one of the best seasons for Epic Games&#x27; battle royale in a while, bringing vampires, heists, and more to the game. But it ends this week, with Epic bringing players back to the Chapter 1 map for the next season of Chapter 4. Thanks to a new trailer released today, we know this throwback season is called Season OG, is a part of Chapter 4, and will be bringing with it a heavy dose of nostalgia. 
That&#x27;s showcased best in today&#x27;s trailer, which highlights the throwback drop spot of Tilted Towers while Juice WRLD&#x27;s &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; plays. Tilted Towers looks as good as we remember it, and you can check it out in the Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG – Return to Tilted Towers gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, this chapter&#x27;s fifth chapter, goes live tomorrow on November 3.

Back in the &#x27;90s, Nintendo played faster and looser with its library of characters. Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you&#x27;re ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!
Impressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can&#x27;t answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a &quot;talk&quot; option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.
Donkey Kong&#x27;s cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled &quot;Guerilla&quot;, but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.

The Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Omni-Man, the J.K. Simmons-voiced character from the Invincible animated series, is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 next week on November 9. Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. 
The trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won&#x27;t spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: 


Omni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9.

                              <span>Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. 


More specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak&#x27;s ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2.

Many players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak&#x27;s cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. 
For more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review.

                              <span>Game Informer can exclusively reveal Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex, a new graphic novel from Dark Horse Books that brings players back into the world of assassin Eivor, a medieval Nordic land, a new hidden order, and more. It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. 
The Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents &quot;blackened by a language he innately understands.&quot; 
&quot;No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it&#x27;s too late?&quot;
Ubisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99.

The studio has released two updates so far, but today&#x27;s Alan Wake 2 update is easily the biggest yet and includes bug fixes, visual issue remedies, and more.

                              <span>We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!
Kingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It&#x27;s a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. 
Escape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.
Both games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.
To play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!

                              <span>Press releases published today by Spain&#x27;s National Police and the Ministry of the Interior celebrated the dismantling of a pirate IPTV operation, the arrest of eight suspects, and alleged losses to rightsholders of €366.25 million. In dozens of local and international news reports, this &#x27;official&#x27; figure is cited verbatim. We have zero faith in it, and we aren&#x27;t alone. After a silent unreferenced edit, the police press release now reads €366,250, but the government&#x27;s copy remains intact.

                              <span>It&#x27;s clear that the Eastern European country of Georgia must dramatically reduce its 90%+ piracy rates to have any chance of joining the EU.  The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment has just announced that in partnership with local government, two of the largest pirate sites in Georgia were recently &quot;shut down.&quot; Interestingly, those same sites were also said to have &quot;shut down&quot; in 2022 when ACE member Cavea+ launched a streaming service in Georgia.

                              <span>Modding Resident Evil with Thomas the Tank Engine in place of Mr. X/Lady Dimitrescu/Nemesis/the monster of your choosing is so much a tradition at this point that Capcom may as well set the inevitable Resident Evil Zero remake aboard the interior of the chirpy children’s TV character. While players might be having fun modding Thomas, Shrek and Barney the Dinosaur into its survival-horror series, Capcom has expressed concern that some mods may cause &quot;reputational damage&quot; to the company and their games.

Mafia II: Definitive Edition
This remaster of the 2010 crime game spruces up the adventure with improved HD visuals. It also includes all of its post-launch DLC. You can us take a tour of the game in this episode of New Gameplay Today.

The non-villains must work together to survive and escape stages in a time machine. The villain player’s job is simple: hunt and destroy everyone else. 
Aliens: Fireteam Elite
Up to four-players team up to battle hordes of xenomorphs in this cooperative class-based shooter. In our review, former editor Jason Guisao gave it a 6.5/10, writing,

                              <span>The Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance has announced the winner of its annual &quot;Anti-Piracy Award.&quot; At this year’s Europol IP Crime conference, the honors went to the Dutch fiscal police (FIOD) for its efforts to combat IPTV piracy. FIOD took down a large-scale IPTV operation earlier this year which impacted over a million subscribers and took an entire datacenter with more than 1,200 servers offline.

                              <span>Brazil&#x27;s telecoms regulator Anatel claims that during an operation last week, it successfully blocked around 80% of pirate &#x27;TV boxes&#x27; in the country. Estimates from early 2023 suggest that seven million were active in Brazil. The operation, claimed to be the most significant ever carried out, arrives just weeks after Google &amp; Cisco were criticized for &quot;turning a blind eye&quot; to the IPTV piracy problem.
