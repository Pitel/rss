                              <span>There&#x27;s also a demo and sale for the first game
Fuga: Melodies of Steel is getting a follow-up. Developer CyberConnect2 confirms that it plans to release Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.
Melodies of Steel 2 will be a direct sequel to the first game. Not much else is known at the moment, but more news is planned for July 28. A &quot;Fuga: Melodies on the Battlefield&quot; anniversary stream is planned for that date.
https://twitter.com/Fuga_CC2_en/status/1547783715476357121
Additionally, the first game Fuga: Melodies of Steel is on sale for 30% off on the eShop until July 24. A demo is also available, with everything up to Chapter 3 playable and saves transferrable to the full game.
Rev up that Soul Cannon
If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the first game, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG about a bunch of young animal children and their giant tank. No, seriously. It follows a band of misfits who commandeer an all-powerful tank to fight back against an evil empire.
It&#x27;s got a timeline-based battle system where you need to swap around different party members on each of the gun emplacements. Certain weapons tackle enemy types like fliers or smaller ground tanks better, and characters can learn new abilities over time.
And of course, if all else fails, there is the Soul Cannon. Basically a giant win card that will offer automatic victory in key fights, at the cost of a party member&#x27;s soul. It&#x27;s uh, bleak, to say the least.

Still, it wound up being a surprisingly fun time that I was glad I tried out last year. It&#x27;s got some really cool ideas with its party management, battle systems, and Metal Slug-style tank designs. The demo&#x27;s worth giving a shot if any of that appeals to you, and I&#x27;m pretty intrigued in seeing what&#x27;s in store for the 28th.

                              <span>Whether it&#x27;s because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios&#x27; first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!


Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title&#x27;s origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You&#x27;ll just have to watch the video to find out.
On top of the Callisto origin story, we&#x27;re also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter&#x27;s dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.
If you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you&#x27;ll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that&#x27;s not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory. Thanks, as always, for watching.</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve the combat of the long-running franchise in meaningful and unprecedented ways. Part of that process involves introducing a skill tree, the first of its kind within the franchise. Sonic has long had adventures that involve him unlocking new abilities, but by introducing a full skill tree in Frontiers, Sonic Team hopes to further enhance what it claims will be the longest mainline game in franchise history.
&quot;Combat with enemies is an important part of Sonic Frontiers,&quot; Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. &quot;Starting out with Sonic at full power would make the combat simple and repetitive, so we made it so the player gradually unlocks Sonic&#x27;s abilities through the skill tree.

So what do you do to try to fix things? No, sorry, you’re wrong. You make the next Community Day about sodding Starly.

Kona developer Parabole and publisher Ravenscourt are back for another cold, strange, survival-tinged mystery. The pair announced Kona II: Brume for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch in 2023. It&#x27;s just a short teaser trailer today, but more details aren&#x27;t far off — the sequel will be playable at gamescom in August at the Indie Booth Arena.

Visual-heavy trailer, right? You&#x27;ll play a detective, Carl Faubert, and yes, there&#x27;s a dog sled. You&#x27;ll also travel by boat in search of clues — and survivors — in a remote mining village plagued by an unnatural mist. Parabole is going for the &quot;omniscient narrator&quot; angle again.
According to Parabole co-founder Alexandre Fiset,…</span>

                              <span>Destiny is now officially part of the PlayStation family
Sony Interactive Entertainment&#x27;s agreement to acquire Bungie has officially closed. With the ink dried, Bungie is now officially part of the PlayStation lineup.
Sony confirmed the news today, welcoming Bungie into the PlayStation family of studios. Bungie also shared the news, saying the studio is excited for the future.
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1547989404269965314
The deal was announced in January, near the start of the year. The $3.6 billion deal brings Destiny into the PlayStation lineup. However, Destiny will continue to publish on multiple platforms. SIE president Jim Ryan said at the time that the deal is part of Sony&#x27;s strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a wider audience.
&quot;We understand how vital Bungie’s community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow,&quot; Ryan told GI Biz. &quot;Like Bungie, our community is core to PlayStation’s DNA, and our shared passion for the gamer and building the best place to play will now evolve even further.&quot;
Deals still in the works
While the Sony and Bungie agreement is now closed, others are still waiting for approval. Microsoft announced its intent to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in January as well. The Microsoft-ActiBlizz deal is under scrutiny from several regulators though.
Take-Two Interactive also announced its plan to acquire Zynga for $12.7 billion in January, and the deal closed in May.
Still, the acquisitions machine rolls on, as plenty more have been announced since January. Those like the purchase of Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal by Embracer Group have still been popping up this year. Whether we see more from Sony or not, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see.

                              <span>Street Fighter, Final Fight, and more
Sega has released the names of 10 more titles to be included on its upcoming retro hardware Sega Mega Drive II Mini. The 10 games are, as of this writing only confirmed for the JPN model of the dinky doohickey, which is reflected in the way that some of these titles were not released outside of Japan.

Among the new titles listed are Capcom classics Super Street Fighter II and Final Fight CD, as well as legendary RPGs Lunar: The Silver Star and Lunar: Eternal Blue. Also in the mix is SNK&#x27;s Fatal Fury 2, Treasure&#x27;s Alien Soldier, and the bizarre tricycle-based arcade game Spatter. A particularly quirky addition is the Wondermega Collection, essentially a sampler disc that includes several Sega Game Toshokan service titles and four CD+G karaoke tracks. A neat little piece of Sega CD history.
The full list of revealed titles is as follows.
Sega Mega Drive Games:
Aah! Harimanada
Alien Soldier
Fatal Fury 2
Gyuwanburaa Jikochuushin Ha Katayama Masayuki no Majong Dojo
Spatter
Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers
Tatsujin
Sega Mega CD Titles
Final Fight CD
Lunar: Eternal Blue
Lunar: The Silver Star
Wondermega Collection
As you might have read on this here website, it has been confirmed that the hardware will receive a western release in the form of the Sega Genesis 2, which will be hitting the shelves day and date alongside the Japanese edition this fall. We can very likely expect any of the above titles that received an English localization back in the day, (Final Fight and Lunar: The Silver Star for example), to be featured on the western release, although official confirmation from Sega is still forthcoming.
The Sega Mega Drive II / Genesis 2 Mini launches October 27.

                              <span>Unite is celebrating its first year with a heap of new content
It&#x27;s been one year since the launch of Pokemon Unite, and the team is celebrating. Over the next few weeks, Pokemon Unite is getting new playable Pokemon, cosmetics, and more to celebrate its first anniversary.
The celebration starts next week, with the release of Glaceon, the icy Eevee evolution. Glaceon joins on July 21 alongside a challenge, which will let players earn a free Glaceon Unite License.
Two more are expected to join the fray, too. The gigantic Buzzwole enters the arena on August 3. And on August 15, Tyranitar lumbers into battle.

Alongside the new playable Pokemon, a new mode is also debuting. Boss Rush will have players team up to take on powerful bosses and earn rewards. Those who finish with higher scores will earn more. The Boss Rush will be available for three periods of time.
Pokemon Unite Boss Rush windows
July 21 at 12:00 a.m. PT to July 24 at 4:59 p.m. PT
July 31 at 5 p.m. PT to August  7 at 4:59 p.m. PT
August 14 at 5 p.m. PT to August 21 at 4:59 p.m. PT
New duds for the new year
A new Battle Pass season will also start rolling out on July 21. Season 9 will have new rewards and levels to pursue, all for the goal of having the coolest-looking Pokemon on the Pokemon Unite field.
There will also be a festive log-in bonus for the first anniversary of Pokemon Unite. Logging in for five days between July 21 and October 12 will net you rewards for each day:
Day 1: Pikachu and Fashionable Style: Pikachu
Day 2: Lucario and Concert Style: Lucario
Day 3: Blastoise and Firefighter Style: Blastoise
Day 4: Snorlax and Bedtime Style: Snorlax
Day 5: Sylveon and Checkered Style: Sylveon
With those, plus a festive anniversary reward chain to chase too, seems like a lot of freebies are up for grabs in Pokemon Unite. The first anniversary might be a good time to log back in if you&#x27;ve lapsed over the last year.

The PC market is currently experiencing its sharpest revenue decline in almost 10 years, that&#x27;s according to the findings of a new report compiled by the number-crunchers over at analysis website Gartner.
During the second quarter of 2022, PC hardware and software shipments declined by a little over 12% year-on-year with the European, Middle East, and African markets (EMEA) dropping by a huge 18% in PC shipments and 20% in laptop shipments. Almost every major player in the industry has seen losses, including HP, Dell, Acer, Lenovo, and Asus. Only Apple saw any recent growth, with a 9.3% sales increase over the same period in 2021.
Gartner&#x27;s analysts have pointed to numerous global factors in decreasing the production, distribution, and purchase of …</span>

[Update: The NPD Group has issued an update, retracting the statement that Elden Ring is one of the all-time top 10 best-selling premium games in the U.S. market.
&quot;Because the ranked charts do not include the full history for all titles and all platforms—across both physical and digital sales—this note was worded too definitively for what is an incomplete comparable universe,&quot; wrote NPD&#x27;s Mat Piscatella on Twitter. &quot;I apologize for the lack of clarity on the note.&quot; Elden Ring has, however, still been the best-selling game for four of its five months on the market.

Odds are if you&#x27;re talking to someone who loves storytelling in video games, there&#x27;s lore from at least one game that they can recite by heart. Especially when it comes to games that really focus on the gameplay first, like League of Legends or Bloodborne, lore is a great, indirect way to get players engaged in the story of your world if there isn&#x27;t much time in the game itself to tell that story.
It can be a case of &quot;come for the game, stay for the story,&quot; or sometimes players get into a game because they learned about all the lore first, but either way, loving a game for the world it creates for us is a beautiful thing. But I have to be honest. For someone who loves story in games like, a lot, I just can&#x27;t bring myself to get into…</span>

                              <span>Lost classic prepares for its prodigal return
In just a week&#x27;s time, a little bit of lost gaming history will be restored, as Square Enix prepares to release its HD remake of the classic &#x27;90s RPG Live A Live. The publisher has released one final trailer to stoke the hype fires ahead of the adventure&#x27;s July 22 launch date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_F_izc7nlnU
Directed by Square Enix veteran Takashi Takita, and released to the Super Famicom platform in 1994, Live A Live was an incredibly ambitious title that attempted to tell the intertwining tales of eight distinct characters, with each tale featuring its own bespoke mechanics, tone, and maps — married together by a grid-based battle system and an umbrella arc involving the very fate of time itself. Despite its ahead-of-its-time and hugely lofty concepts, Live A Live was something of a flop on release, and would thus not receive any official localization outside of Japan.
Square Enix&#x27;s new edition of Live A Live is being developed by studio Historia, which has meticulously recreated the original Super Famicom adventure with new &quot;2D HD&quot; visuals. In addition, the original 16-bit score — beautifully composed by industry veteran Yoko Shimomura — has been rearranged and rerecorded for the new release. The Live A Live remake will offer RPG fans worldwide their first official opportunity to check out this lost piece of experimental game design. Born out of time and flying under the radar, perhaps this new release will afford this forgotten release the opportunity to earn the legacy that has evaded it for three decades.
Live A Live launches on Nintendo Switch July 22. You can download a demo from the eShop today.

Sonic Frontiers might not even be out and in the players&#x27; hands yet, but it appears that the development squad at Sonic Team already knows exactly what is in store for The Blue Blur and his friends in the wake of the open-world adventure&#x27;s release — that&#x27;s according to the studio&#x27;s own head Takashi Iizuka.
Iizuka made the comments in a highly entertaining, rapid-fire video interview with Game Informer reporter and Sonic the Hedgehog megafan Brian Shea. Over the course of eight minutes, Shea hits Iizuka with over 120 questions pertaining to Sonic Frontiers, as well as various elements of the Sonic universe including Chaotix, Amy Rose, Sonic R music, chili dogs, and the notorious Princess Elise.

Warner Bros. Games has announced that it will be opening the dimensional portals of its madcap platform fighter MultiVersus later this month, with the arrival of the game&#x27;s first open beta. This trial will give players worldwide an opportunity to check out the wild crossover brawler and its kooky roster.

Anyone wishing to check out the fun-looking fighter for themselves should head on over to the official MultiVersus website and sign up for early access, then you will be ready to rock when developer Player First Games opens the servers on July 19. If you participated in the closed beta earlier this year, then you&#x27;re already good to go, just remember to reinstall the game client on your platform of choice.

Epic Games Store users can bag themselves an absolute gem of a title for free, as Dotemu&#x27;s Wonder Boy: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap is offered up to all EGS customers gratis this week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;eYXzXBbFKOY
Developed by Lizardcube and released in 2017, Wonder Boy: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap is a remake done right. Based upon the excellent 1989 Sega Master System RPG, Lizardcube&#x27;s title recreates the cart-based classic in a 1:1 capacity, switching out the 8-bit visuals for stylish and attractive hand-drawn visuals. In addition, the remake features a charming, rerecorded score, and includes new features such as additional difficulty options and a new playable hero, Wonder Girl.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;dMah9liwPyY
In addition to the Wonder Boy remake, Epic Games Store will also be giving away  Baeloth&#x27;s Gladiator of the Dark Pits expansion pack, for use with Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure title Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realm. Players need only log in to the D&amp;D title from July 14 to automatically unlock access to the DLC expansion.
The new titles will be made available for all to download from July 14-21. Next week, from July 21-28, players can claim the shopkeeping sim Shop Titans and the 64-player WWI FPS Tannenberg.
If you do not have it already, be sure to pick up The Dragon&#x27;s Trap. Without hyperbole, it is one of the most enjoyable, enduring, and compelling remakes ever made.

The great simulation flood continues to ebb and flow on Steam, and sometimes, a curious new highly niche PC game washes ashore. (Thanks, Rock, Paper, Shotgun.) You might think you&#x27;ve seen it all by now, but then there&#x27;s this: ASMR Food Experience, a game about running a restaurant while (hopefully pleasant) sounds put you in a daze.

The trailer looks proof-of-concept-y, as is often the way, but I like the concept.
And looking over the screenshots — a tomato being slowly sliced, a filet sizzling on the stovetop, a splash of water hitting a glass of ice cubes— I can just &quot;hear&quot; these images. Depending on the person, &quot;ASMR sounds&quot; can be soothing or offputting, and I tend to fall in the former group more often than the latt…</span>

                              <span>Because sure, why not
Wordle has seen huge success, as it went from cute and engaging daily game to overnight craze. It&#x27;s now owned by the New York Times, and the Times is partnering with Hasbro now to make a Wordle board game.
CNN reports that the New York Times and Hasbro are collaborating on Wordle: The Party Game, a board game adaptation of the online version.
In the board game version, players compete with each other to guess words the other players have scribbled. Rather than guessing the word solo against the computer, you&#x27;re trying to guess the other team&#x27;s chosen five-letter word. It&#x27;s kind of like Mastermind or Battleship, but with words.

There are a few different game types out of the box, including a &quot;fast mode&quot; that involves a clock and team variations. I also dig the dry-erase boards and markers, so it&#x27;s easy to just re-use the same board over and over again.
Wordle: The Party Game is currently live for pre-order on Amazon, the Hasbro site, and soon on Target. The board game goes for $19.99 and will ship on October 1, 2022.
Guess the secret phrase
While strange, it isn&#x27;t all too surprising. Board games are increasingly popular as of late, and board game adaptations are no different. Look at how many video games have been turned into tabletop versions over the years.
With the popularity of Wordle, I imagine a Worlde board game will absolutely sell like hotcakes. And now I&#x27;m just curious if other popular online games are soon to be adapted, too. How much longer until newfound Heardle owner Spotify turns the audio game into a board game?

The live-action adaptations of the Resident Evil franchise have had a real rough time of it, huh? Paul W.S. Anderson’s six-movie take on the series — while commercially successful — was widely slated by fans of the games and critics alike for diverting too far away from the tone and scope of Capcom’s source (plus, some of them were just straight up bad), and the 2021 reboot, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, didn’t fare much better. Despite being significantly more faithful to the games, Johannes Roberts’ movie was criticised for its writing and attempts to cram as much fan-service into one movie as possible.
When Netflix announced its own take on Resident Evil via an eight-episode series, fans were understandably sceptical that the streaming juggernaut could pull off what Anderson and Roberts failed to do. Not only that, but initial details on the series set off alarm bells immediately: a series focusing on the daughters of Albert Wesker? What? It didn’t sound promising, particularly when show-runners would later promise that the series would tie in with the game series&#x27; canon.

                              <span>The Joys and Cons, direct to you.
With the reveal of a new trailer for Bayonetta 3 along with a launch date announcement, Nintendo fans are looking back over the last couple of weeks with a question on their mind: Why didn&#x27;t the company bundle up this news with the third-party announcements from the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase and deliver a full-fat Nintendo Direct?
In the time since the Partner Showcase — which, let&#x27;s not forget, featured some pretty impressive reveals and shadow-drops itself — we&#x27;ve had a Xenoblade Direct, the reveal of an entirely new Kirby game coming this summer, and the Bayonetta 3 news. We&#x27;ve also had reveals of a new Splatoon-themed Switch OLED, Joy-Con, and Pro Controller, and another a micro-announcement in the form of Pokémon Puzzle League coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The latter perhaps isn&#x27;t Direct-worthy on its own, unless you&#x27;re the lovely Jon Cartwright (formerly of this parish), in which case it&#x27;s worthy of the &#x27;one last thing&#x27; slot.

Everyone knows the best Pokémon are the spherical ones, and Pokémon Center Japan has finally seen the light, announcing a new &quot;life size&quot; Spheal plush.
(For the record, Spheal is about 80cm tall. Or... wide. Because he is round. The plush is 80 × 98 × 100cm.)

Since June, it feels like we&#x27;ve been getting a proper avalanche of Sonic Frontiers news, with the game currently scheduled to release toward the end of 2022. Although initial fan reaction to the gameplay footage was, shall we say, mixed, it seems many people are starting to come around to the game&#x27;s drastic new direction, particularly after its impressive showing at the recent Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase.
In a piece by Game Informer, it&#x27;s been revealed that Sonic Team is hoping the latest entry will elevate the series&#x27; overarching narrative to new heights and transcend the usual &quot;good guys versus bad guys&quot; scenario that&#x27;s been the focal point of the franchise up till now.

This review originally went live in 2008, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival on Switch as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

For those who have dabbled with Puzzle League, this is obvious information, but please bear with us. Tetris Attack, the SNES game, was a westernized version of the Japanese game Panel de Pon, which starred its own cute cartoon characters. Tetris Attack removed all of these and replaced them with characters and enemies from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island (and was relocalized for Japan as BS Yoshi&#x27;s Panepon). However, released in North America in 2000, Pokémon Puzzle League was the first game under the &#x27;Puzzle League&#x27; banner, with characters from the Pokémon anime spicing up its addictive block puzzling.

                              <span>It won&#x27;t come cheap, though.
Dark Souls is known for its relentless (but fair) difficulty, but it&#x27;s also gained significant renown for its sweeping, dense lore and narrative. There are so many interesting nuggets tucked into the game&#x27;s world, it can be difficult for even the most passionate fans to see and appreciate all of it.
The good news, then, is that there is a stunning book on the way that dives into all of it called &#x27;Abyssal Archive&#x27;. Written by Dark Souls scholar &#x27;Lokey&#x27; over the course of several years, the book comes in two volumes and boasts incredible detail throughout, with pre-orders set to ship in early 2023.

                              <span>If the Wii U is hacked, mind.
The PC port for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has been out for a few months now, and modders have been doing some pretty crazy stuff with it, too. Now, it looks like the port can also be played on Mac OS and hacked Wii U consoles, opening it up to a much wider audience.
As reported by VGC, the latest release of the port from Harbour Masters can be downloaded via the team’s official Discord. Dubbed &#x27;Ship of Harkinian&#x27;, the latest release also comes with a few extra bits and bobs, including:

The highly anticipated remake for 1994&#x27;s Live A Live is just around the corner, due for release on July 22nd (that&#x27;s next week, folks - not long!). To celebrate, Square-Enix has shared a &#x27;Final Trailer&#x27; for the game on its YouTube channel.
The video showcases the game&#x27;s various settings and time periods, along with the characters and enemies you&#x27;re going to be encountering. There&#x27;s a hefty glimpse at some of the combat too, but keep in mind you can try this out for yourself right now with the demo.

Recycling has been a pretty big thing for a while now, and for good reason. Chucking a load of plastic away is, of course, terrible for the environment, so why not break it down and use it for something else? One talented artist has done just that, taking a whole bunch of random bits of garbage and remaking it into something truly beautiful - a miniature diorama of Super Mario Odyssey.
Posted by Studson Studio on YouTube, the progress video shows how he went about creating the miniature diorama, from combining bits of plastic junk to form the foundation of the Odyssey ship to creating a base of dirt from, er... dirt. It&#x27;s a fascinating process and we recommend you watch the whole video to truly appreciate the work that&#x27;s gone into this thing. We appreciate all types of art, of course, but when it also goes toward helping the environment, heck yeah - we love it.

This has also got some fans wondering how much longer Nintendo will continue to support the N64 Expansion Pack library. Fortunately, there&#x27;s no need to panic. The company today issued a message (via social media) - reassuring fans it will continue to deliver N64 games. Phew!

                              <span>As much as I enjoy watching the Tour De France, I have a weak grasp of professional cycling&#x27;s strategic level. While individual riders get the fame, it is a team sport with complex tactics and strategies across each stage and the overall race—which sometimes leave me flummoxed. So to help me better understand, I&#x27;ve been playing two strat-o-management games: the flashy Pro Cycling Manager 2022 (from the makers of the official Tour De France game) and the board game-esque indie game The Cyclist: Tactics.

                              <span>My family is obsessed with Wordle. Their love for the five-letter-word guessing game has become so strong that we&#x27;ve had to create a separate family Whatsapp group for it. Now, Wordle owner The New York Times has partnered with Hasbro to make it into a real-world tabletop game - and I think I might have excuse myself from every family gathering going forward, because I know that someone&#x27;s inevitably going to buy this for someone&#x27;s Christmas or birthday present in the future, and it&#x27;s going to be all they ever want to do and talk about. Help.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Unity announced they were merging with mobile ads company ironSource, who are arguably best known for developing a malware installer in 2015. Unsurprisingly, game developers were not pleased. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, however, Unity CEO John Riccitiello was interviewed by PocketGamer.biz on Wednesday, wherein he called developers who failed to plan monetisation strategies when creating their games were “some of the biggest fucking idiots”. Oh dear.

                              <span>For the most part, PowerWash Simulator helps me reach a state of total focus. Grime must be eliminated and I am there to facilitate that request with water and power. But occasionally I succumb to frustration as something I consider pristine isn&#x27;t determined clean by the little progress bar that usually pats me on the back for jobs well done.
Then I learned that although grime can’t move, it makes up for it with cunning. It cements itself on surfaces in ways you wouldn&#x27;t expect, as if to belittle my cleaning standards. After many encounters, I&#x27;ve identified this menace as The Underside: a secret boss you&#x27;ll need to beat to become the ultimate power washer.

                              <span>Prettiness, a strong musical score, and being a very welcome product of Persian myth and literature rather than Mount Olympus or Shakesbore again are good reasons to consider The Tale of Bistun. But I am absolutely shallow enough to be immediately invested in a game that implies my overarching goal will be to team up with Shohreh Aghdashloo. It turns out she&#x27;s barely in it, but by the time I&#x27;d figured that out I was already won over.

As a result, a few of us here at the RPS Treehouse have finally received that much anticipated email letting us know that our little handheld baby is ready to be personally delivered by Gabe Newell dressed like a big stork. Editor-in-chief Katharine was the first to receive their shiny new Steam Deck, following hardware editor James who&#x27;s had a review copy since February, so we were keen to hear her first impressions of the console.

Annoyingly for folks like us who have to write about it, they’ve decided to drop the capital S and add a completely unnecessary full stop to its new name. Yep, it&#x27;s no longer Skate 4, but &quot;skate.&quot;. At least it’s going free-to-play.

                              <span>A Las Vegas company and its owner have been named in a DISH Network lawsuit targeting pirate IPTV service VNest TV. DISH says the service offered more than 5,000 channels including some obtained from its satellite feeds and others from Sling TV&#x27;s online broadcasts. DISH believes VNest TV obtained channels from Nitro TV, a service recently hit with a $100m+ judgment.

                              <span>Google began to delist pirate sites from local search results last year. The search engine voluntarily complies with court orders targeted at third-party Internet providers. This is also true in the UK, where The Pirate Bay initially remained unblocked. A recent wave of removal requests corrected this initial oversight and hundreds of Pirate Bay domains have since been removed.

                              <span>You can DDT the competition very soon
The multiplayer wrestling battle royale Rumbleverse is launching quite soon. Iron Galaxy announced today that Rumbleverse will launch on August 11 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC via Epic.
The free-to-play brawler goes live on the 11th, and a week later the first season of Rumbleverse will kick off. According to Iron Galaxy&#x27;s blog, this will include a Battle Pass with cosmetics to earn along a special path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;suOmxeeyRsI
Rumbleverse is a 40-player battle royale-style game. But rather than guns and shooting, Rumbleverse is about good ol&#x27; fashioned wrestling. Characters can pick up and use various moves like strikes, kicks, uppercuts, and giant slams to knock out opponents.
Announced in December during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse was set to launch in February. Iron Galaxy delayed the launch though, and has been running tests and early playtimes. Now, it seems like the fighter&#x27;s ready to head into the ring.
Bah gawd
It&#x27;s been hard to miss Rumbleverse, as it&#x27;s been making the rounds in the fighting game community social sphere with each new playtest. And I&#x27;ll admit, the concept has me intrigued. Plenty of battle royale games hone in on accuracy and shooting ability, but very few have sated the brawling, fighting, wrasslin&#x27; urge.
There have been several battle royales that have gone into and out of the spotlight over the years, but this one at least seems worth a test drive. At the low, low price of free, why not?
Rumbleverse slams onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store on August 11.

Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have proudly announced that super-fun beat-&#x27;em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge smashed its release sales expectations, having sold a mighty one million copies during its first seven days of release. Radical.
&quot;Tribute Games set out to make the ultimate celebration of a chapter in TMNT history that means the world to us, and it’s been wonderful to watch the accessible fun of beat-em-ups resonate with longtime fans and genre newcomers alike,&quot; said Tribute Games Co-Founder Jean-Francois Major in a press release. &quot;We’re thankful for all of the support and encouragement the passionate TMNT community has shown us since the reveal of TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, and we look forward to watching players continue to discover the easter eggs we’ve hidden throughout the game while chaining together some bodacious combos.&quot;

Kicking off on PC and consoles on July 16, Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is a passionate recall of the classic Konami TMNT arcades of yesterday. Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael take to the streets of New York once again to see off the evil Foot Clan, as well as a host of iconic villains from the classic 1987 animated series. Joined on the journey by pals Splinter, April O&#x27;Neil, and an unlockable Casey Jones, our heroes in a half-shell battle it out in colorful and chaotic arcade action. It&#x27;s good old-fashioned fun for one-to-four players, and a must-buy for any fan of the enduring TMNT franchise.
TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It is also available via Xbox Game Pass. You can check out our review of the bodacious brawler right here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s going to be &#x27;intense&#x27;
Another Aliens video game is in development, this time at Survios, the VR-centric studio behind games like Raw Data, Creed: Rise to Glory, and The Walking Dead Onslaught.
The studio hasn&#x27;t announced the name yet, but says the game will fall into the single-player, action-horror camp, which is something I can vaguely latch onto. Vaguely. It&#x27;s another &quot;original storyline, set between the Alien and Aliens ﬁlms,&quot; in which a &quot;battle-hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.&quot; Alien Islolation 2 this is not.
Built in Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles, and VR platforms, the Aliens game &quot;will take full advantage of Survios’ expertise in creating immersive and authentic gaming experiences.&quot;
More details at SDCC
With only some Xenomorph artwork to go on for now, we&#x27;ll have to wait until San Diego Comic-Con to learn more. Survios will share more details during the Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe panel at SDCC next Thursday, July 21 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific.
&quot;The vast universe of Alien is full of untold stories, and opportunities to create gripping original games,&quot; said Luigi Priore, vice president, Disney, Pixar, and 20th Century Games. &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled to work with a team like Survios who shares our passion for Alien.&quot;
The studio is very much staffing up, hence this early, detail-light game announcement.
For all of the effort so far, I feel like the Aliens series hasn&#x27;t been able to capture lightning in a bottle lately, and I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;ll change anytime soon. Another upcoming game, Aliens: Dark Descent from Tindalos Interactive, is a squad-commanding real-time action game. Could be good! Or it could be another one that pads out the list.
At least with VR in the picture, we might get some adrenaline-pumping moments.

Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games have released the first major DLC update for their multiplayer horror title, Evil Dead: The Game. Now available to download on all platforms, the content drop contains maps, modes, and weaponry for you and your posse&#x27;s battle with the spooky Deadite army.
Themed after the third mainline Evil Dead movie, Army of Darkness, (aka The Medievil Dead, aka Bruce Campbell vs Army of Darkness), the DLC features a much-needed new map, styled after the castle keep from the 1992 horror comedy. Visit the fortified Castle Kandar, the notorious abandoned windmill, and the Arthurian Outpost as you and your fellow monster slayers gather the mythic artifacts necessary to banish the Kandarian Demon and its minions to the Netherworld.

Spidersaurs is arguably the biggest release hitting the Switch today, as WayForward goes back to its roots yet again with another cartoonishly-presented run and gun platformer. To save the day, you&#x27;ll bring two characters through six levels to take out literal dinosaur-spider hybrids created in a lab, with old-school sensibilities and boss battles.
As is customary with WayForward, Spidersaurs will have an animated intro (this one is styled after Saturday morning cartoons), as well as co-op play. Unlocks, as well as three difficulty settings are in too. Also, XEL is coming to Switch. The well-reviewed Steam game arrived this week, and will be hitting the Switch eShop today.

                              <span>This game led to another rebirth of Square Enix JRPGs
The fourth Octopath Traveler anniversary is upon us, seeing as the original release was back on July 13, 2018.
Square Enix is celebrating with a tweet, reminding us of the four-year anniversary, and providing a &quot;commemorative illustration&quot; of the crew from a member of producer Tomoya Asano&#x27;s team: Tatsuaki Urushihara. They also remind folks that Live a Live is coming out later this month. So while we haven&#x27;t gotten a direct sequel yet in the west (a mobile prequel called Champions of the Continent came out in 2020 in Japan, and is coming soon elsewhere), it&#x27;s impacted many other projects since its launch, and has shifted Square Enix&#x27;s priorities as a whole.
Octopath Traveler can be considered a bird of a feather with several other modern pushes for JRPGs within the company. One of the bigger waves involved Bravely Default, which came roaring in during 2012, and reminded people that yes, there is an audience for the genre still. There was another wave in 2016 with I Am Setsuna, which ushered in the creation of Tokyo RPG Factory, and led to Lost Sphear, and Oninaki.
The legacy of Octopath itself (amid this Octopath Traveler anniversary) is directly responsible for the existence of Triangle Strategy, as well as numerous other games in that same style. Square Enix even cited Octopath Traveler&#x27;s aesthetic choice as an influence and drive to bring Live a Live back in the form of a remake.

                              <span>The Crusaders embark for a new realm
Owlcat Games&#x27; Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is making the leap to consoles. The giant RPG will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both physically and digitally on Sept. 29, as well as Nintendo Switch via cloud.
Wrath of the Righteous will also be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, via backward compatibility. Once the console version launches, the Enhanced Edition of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will become the standard version, and PC owners will all get that version for free on Sept. 29.
Owlcat has also announced that The Treasure of the Midnight Isles, the third DLC for this Pathfinder, launches on August 11. This new adventure heads to the Midnight Isles, where horrors and terrors abound. There&#x27;s both a standalone rogue-like mode and campaign option available, allowing players to experiment with builds and party compositions if they&#x27;d like. Even if a party dies, its progress can help future playthroughs.

The Treasure of the Midnight Isles will be available either as a separate purchase, or as part of the season pass.
Many stories to tell
Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is, by all accounts, a massive RPG. It&#x27;s got a somewhat-daunting amount of content, not all too dissimilar from other isometric RPGs. But if you&#x27;re looking for a console RPG to eat up your time, you could probably do worse. Impressions of the PC version seem mostly positive, and there&#x27;s even more on the way with the Midnight Isles DLC.
Owlcat, meanwhile, is also forging on to a new franchise. Last month&#x27;s Warhammer Skulls festival showcase confirmed that Owlcat is creating a Warhammer 40K CRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.

                              <span>Tourney attendees can check out Capcom&#x27;s latest
In news that, quite honestly, was something of an inevitability, Capcom has revealed that its recent Street Fighter 6 demo will be making the rounds at next month&#x27;s Evolution (EVO) fighting game tournament. Attendees will be able to check out the upcoming fighter live on location at Mandalay Bay.
While trial sessions of Street Fighter 6 have been mostly confined to the press and/or Capcom&#x27;s best buddies, the publisher is now beginning to drip-feed access to the public at several upcoming events, such as the aforementioned EVO and the incoming San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC). I would not be surprised if, much like with Street Fighter V, we don&#x27;t also see some form of closed or open beta rolling out as we exit summer and enter the fall season.
https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1547219490508767233?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;XbidzCD5y6vvVQGjKHRCTQ
While Street Fighter fans were hit with an abundance of info (both officially and very unofficially) last month, Capcom has since gone quiet on the new fighter, with nary a new character announcement, trailer, or update to be seen. We are almost guaranteed to hear some new info at EVO, (perhaps even SDCC), hopefully in the form of a character trailer or two. In the meantime, be sure to check out our previous reports on the leaked character roster, the breakdown of Family Man Guile, and a look at the sequel&#x27;s intriguing new mechanics.
EVO 2022 will take place at Las Vegas&#x27; Mandalay Bay resort on the weekend of August 5-7. Tomorrow is the final day to register for the event. Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox in 2023.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s also just called Skate
Electronic Arts and developer Full Circle hosted the first of a new video series about its upcoming Skate game today. Alongside confirming it&#x27;s simply called Skate, the team confirms Skate will be a free-to-play live-service game.
The new episode of &quot;The Board Room&quot; goes into detail about the upcoming model for the new Skate. (Not Skate 4, by the way. Skate, period.) It&#x27;s targeting PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and will be both cross-play and cross-progression.
Skate will also be free to play. The team outlines four rules they have for their monetization: no pay-to-win, no map areas behind a paywall, no paid loot boxes, and no paid gameplay advantages.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FAMgtFyrQLk
In an interview with The Verge, Skate head of product management Isabelle Mocquard says microtransactions in the game are &quot;primarily&quot; going to be for cosmetics and convenience.
&quot;I want it to be very clear that it’s not a pay-to-win game,&quot; Mocquard tells The Verge. &quot;There won’t be any gameplay areas hidden exclusively behind a paywall. Players won’t be able to buy any gameplay altering advantages.&quot;
The Skate team is planning on things like seasonal drops and live events, though it is still exploring options. Mobile is also an option the team is currently investigating.
Skate collaboration
Another feature the team talks about in this new update is CollaboZones. These let players collaboratively build areas that appear in other players&#x27; worlds. It&#x27;s got a lot of potential for chaos, that&#x27;s for sure. Giant ramps, slides, and sheer chaos seems like it fits the Skate bill.
No release date has been set yet. The team is extending out invites for the Skate playtest though, to get more players into the early look at this new skateboarding game. Just make sure you&#x27;re opting in through proper channels, and not any sketchy websites.

                              <span>Earn rewards and loyalty points for playing games
Brand loyalty is getting more rewarding. Sony has revealed it&#x27;s launching a new loyalty program called PlayStation Stars, rewarding players for playing games and completing various activities.
In a new PlayStation blog, Sony VP of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise Grace Chen describes what&#x27;s in store for the program. While it doesn&#x27;t have an exact launch date just yet, the plan is for PlayStation Stars to reward players for doing things in their games.
One example is completing a campaign by winning a tournament. Another might require earning a specific trophy, or being the first person to Platinum a game in your time zone. Others might just be check-in campaigns, only asking you to play the game.

                              <span>&quot;Naive Angel Mode&quot;
Following Nintendo&#x27;s release date announcement, Platinum had a tweet of their own to showcase a Bayonetta 3 optional mode: a toggle, actually.
It&#x27;s called &quot;Naïve Angel mode, and here&#x27;s what the developer had to say about it:
&quot;Relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever. We&#x27;ve added the revolutionary &#x27;Naive Angel Mode&#x27; to Bayonetta 3 so more people can fully enjoy it. By turning it on, you can play right in the living room without having to worry about what&#x27;s on screen... we think.&quot;

The tweet goes a step further and actually shows the mode in action with a 40-second video. It slides back and forth and shows what a scene might look like with the toggle on or off. For the most part, as is customary, this seems like it&#x27;ll be heavily used during &quot;finishers,&quot; when Bayonetta utilizes various transformation forms to cut down bosses — but it can also apply costume changes. If you&#x27;re curious, you can watch it below!
This is such a loaded issue, but having it as an optional toggle should (ha!) satisfy as many people as possible. People who don&#x27;t like the Bayonetta 3 optional mode can completely ignore it, and relish the fact that Nintendo is still releasing M-rated games (as has been the case for a while) on the system. The phrase &quot;relax, the witch is back and sexier than ever&quot; implies that Bayonetta 3 will not be a compromise per se.
While talks with platform holders as to what remains &quot;acceptable&quot; rage on (mainly with Sony), these sorts of clever solutions could allow studios to have it both ways.

To say I&#x27;ve been on something of a high since Capcom revealed Street Fighter 6 is certainly an understatement. I&#x27;ve pretty much covered the title every other day since, in some form or fashion. But while this obsession has been driven by the unbridled joy I&#x27;ve gotten with each and every SF6 headline, reveal, or leak, today&#x27;s article is, finally, something about the game which I think is pretty damn awful.
And it concerns our NKOTB Luke, and his god-fucking-awful dancing.
Spotted, recorded, and uploaded by Capcom Europe brand manager Matthew Edwards, (who is currently in attendance at Japan Expo 2022), the former military brat has been caught busting out a few steps upon successfully completing a round without taking a lick of damage. It&#x27;s worse than you could…</span>

                              <span>On top of the Trinity Masquerade Special Edition of Bayonetta 3
A Bayonetta Switch physical edition is coming &quot;later this year,&quot; according to Nintendo, who will be providing more info at a later date.
The news was revealed with the Bayonetta 3 launch date trailer this week, but Nintendo has separately clarified a bit on how that distribution of the first game will go down.
Since collectors will be itching for any kernel of info, here is everything we have on the Bayonetta Switch physical edition, straight from Nintendo
It&#x27;s priced at $30, MSRP
It&#x27;ll be a standalone physical release on September 30, 2022
&quot;A limited number of the Bayonetta physical version will be available to pre-order via select retailers and available at launch in the My Nintendo Store&quot;
The Masquerade Edition of Bayonetta 3 will contain three game sleeves, one for Bayonetta 1
Hopefully the rollout will be smooth, and will provide plentiful options/stock, with safeguards in place for bots/scalpers. That will totally happen you all.
But really folks! Ideally, none of these retailer drops will be &quot;two-minute sellouts at 2AM Eastern time,&quot; or riddled with hours-long login queues. This isn&#x27;t a special edition, it&#x27;s a $30 re-release.
That said, there is a special edition in the works for Bayonetta 3: the aforementioned Masquerade Edition. You can get a look at it here:

                              <span>Back to the arcade
Growing up in the ‘90s in rural Canada meant that I saw the decline of the arcade early. However, I’ve always had an overwhelming fondness for them. My mind is so focused on video games, that I can still point out the bowling alleys that had a Metal Slug cabinet. I recall the time that one place had Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter. What a win! When I went to Japan, I stopped in every tobacco-scented game center I crossed paths with.
I recently changed my life by getting a decent arcade stick. It’s very difficult to find any cabinets these days (I wonder if the Galaxy Theatre still has Virtual On), but the feeling of slamming my fingers across a cluster of big ol’ buttons eases my longing.
But a good arcade stick is nothing without games to play using it.…</span>

                              <span>Well, not JUST like wine. You can&#x27;t drink a book.
I don&#x27;t know much about wine, but I sure like to pretend I do, and I bet I&#x27;m not alone. Who else here — of drinking age, that is — has bought a red wine to accompany dinner, because it &quot;goes well with pasta&quot;? How many times have you been poured a glass of wine to &quot;taste&quot; in a fancy restaurant, going through the whole rigmarole of smacking your lips together and saying &quot;oh yes, lovely&quot; even though it just tastes like wine? And, be honest now, do you do that thing where you try a new wine and then try to guess the random assortment of fruits on the label to show off in front of your friends? &quot;Oh, yes, plum, see, I did mention stone fruits, didn&#x27;t I, Janice?&quot; Yeah, we&#x27;re all the same, and we all have no idea what we&#x27;re talking about.
But here&#x27;s something I do know about: Video games. I&#x27;ve been doing this job for a while now, and I&#x27;ve played quite a few of them. I am no sommelier of digital media, mind you, but I&#x27;m definitely knowledgeable enough to be able to recommend you a hearty, robust RPG or a nice indie palate-cleanser, depending on your taste. But I would like to propose a change to the way we talk about games, at the risk that it&#x27;s going to make me sound like the kind of person that won&#x27;t shut up about wine.

                              <span>Now that&#x27;s podracing.
If Mario Kart 8 and F-Zero had a baby, it might look like Redout 2, an anti-gravity, neon dystopian racing game that&#x27;s finally coming to the Nintendo Switch.
Redout 2 is already out on PC and all the various Xboxes and PlayStations, and includes a single-player career mode and competitive multiplayer, with up to 12 people to race against across 36 tracks. You can customise your own hovership with 12 chassis choices, flaps, wings, spoilers, rocket engines, and more, and then do a classy car photoshoot with the game&#x27;s Photo Mode. There&#x27;s also a bangin&#x27; soundtrack that features electronic artists from Zardonic and Dance with the Dead to the legendary composer Giorgio Moroder.

Correction: The Collector&#x27;s Edition and Physical Edition of Sol Cresta were previously sold in the West through Limited Run Games, and have since sold out. These two new releases allow players to purchase the two versions again through LRG&#x27;s newly-formed Japanese publishing arm, SuperDeluxe. The article has been edited to reflect this.
PlatinumGames is having quite the week. After finally announcing the release date of Bayonetta 3, they&#x27;ve now announced that their retro-style vertical shmup Sol Cresta will be getting a reprint of the limited-edition Collector&#x27;s Package and physical game on Switch and PS4.

Ah, the beautiful game. It&#x27;s the world&#x27;s most popular sport, so news that Mario Strikers: Battle League has already overtaken lifetime sales of Mario Golf: Super Rush in Europe less than a month after release may not come as a massive surprise, even if Super Rush has been out for over a year. We&#x27;re big golf fans here at Nintendo Life — any excuse to wear loud trousers — but of course a football game is going to do better! Being based in the UK, we&#x27;re legally required to love football more than any other country. Except that&#x27;s not true, if physical European sales of Mario&#x27;s latest kickaround are anything to go by.
According to GSD (Games Sales Data) physical sales figures from GameIndustry.Biz&#x27;s June report, it&#x27;s not the UK but France who has demonstrated the lion&#x27;s share of the soccer love on the European continent — at least where Mario is concerned — with 40% of all physical copies sold so far going into the hands of French football (and Switch) fans.

                              <span>Taking the Zelda formula into space.
Zelda games have laid out a comfortable roadmap for developers to follow when making action-adventure games, and there&#x27;s no shortage of Zelda-likes to enjoy on Switch and elsewhere. Tiny Roar evidently took heavy notes from Nintendo’s storied franchise when putting together XEL, which takes cues from both classic and modern Zelda titles and places them in a beautiful sci-fi setting that, at first glance, is perfect for exploring. Unfortunately, there are some serious technical issues with the visuals on Switch that hold it back from reaching its full potential.
XEL follows the story of Reid, a wise-cracking spaceship pilot who crash-lands in a strange environment with no memory of her past or even her name. She is quickly joined by Chap, a silent robot floating companion who encourages her to look around this strange new land. The world is bright and colourful, giving a beautiful glimpse into a world of advanced technology that has been reclaimed by nature.

Publisher Annapurna Interactive has partnered with cat Travel Cat, a brand of cat travel accessories, to unveil an official line of Stray-branded cat harnesses and backpacks for your real-life kitty.
First up is the harness, a replica of the one worn by Stray’s furry protagonist. It features adjustable chest and neck straps secured by buckles and velcro. The six-foot reflective nylon leash helps owners keep track of their cats in dark alleys while allowing room to explore. You can pre-order it today for $39.99. 

If you’d rather give your cat the royal transportation treatment, the Stray version of Travel Cat’s popular “The Fat Cat” backpack is up your alley. This colorful pack can support up to 25 lbs of feline and is made of breathable, well-ventilated material and a little bubble for the cat to curiously peer at the world. Pre-orders are open now and will set you back $139.99.

You can purchase both items, which are expected to ship later this year, at Travel Cat’s website here.
Stray launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC and stars an orange cat searching for its family in a futuristic neon city inhabited by robots. You can watch the game’s most recent trailer here.</span>

                              <span>Following the unfulfilling story of Sonic Forces in 2017, many were concerned about the direction of future narratives. When Sonic Frontiers was first announced, fans were happy to learn that longtime Sonic the Hedgehog comics writer Ian Flynn joined Sonic Team in writing the game. Flynn has been a prominent writer across both the long-running Archie Comics and IDW Publishing runs of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, with hundreds of credits to his name. However, joining Sonic Team for a mainline entry is new territory.
&quot;Ian has been working as a comic writer for a long time, so I was very familiar with his work, but after reading the IDW comics, I was even more impressed with his talent,&quot; Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. &quot;That&#x27;s why I wanted to ask him to work on the story fo…</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. crossover platform fighter MultiVersus will soon be playable once again, this time to everyone who wants to throw down. The game’s first open beta kicks off on July 26. Additionally, an early access period begins a week earlier on July 19 for anyone who participated in May’s closed alpha or received Twitch drop codes.
The open beta for the free-to-play fighter will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.
The peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. 


We still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far. These tests should only help the game become better when it goes prime time.</span>

What do a murderous witch, a grandmother’s mysterious death, and demonic possession have in common? An old Polaroid-style camera. Discovering how means braving Madison, an indie horror title that fits within the post-P.T. first-person haunted house mold. Players explore an impressively rendered home solving puzzles and avoiding apparitions armed with a camera that’s more than meets the eye. Despite having a strong premise, presentation, and core mechanic, the experience gets bogged down by flawed puzzle de…</span>

                              <span>A new game based on the film Aliens is in the works by developer Survios in partnership with 20th Century Games.
Survios primarily develops VR titles and is perhaps best known as the team behind Creed: Rise to Glory. The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game&#x27;s website states that it&#x27;s developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens &quot;where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.&quot;
There’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.
This project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.</span>

                              <span>Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty &amp; licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. 
According to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. 
You can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.
Loyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.&quot; Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. 
These collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  
“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.
PlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo&#x27;s various IPs. 
According to Eurogamer, it&#x27;s unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures&#x27; – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: 
&quot;Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo&#x27;s results for this fiscal year.&quot;

                              <span>Rumbleverse, Iron Galaxy’s pro-wrestling-tinged spin on battle royale, is finally going live next month. The game was set to arrive in February before being delayed and has been playable through various technical tests. 
First announced during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse is a free-to-play battle royale where players duke it out by brawling instead of shooting. Wrestling moves like suplexes and clotheslines reign supreme, and weapons include steel chairs and other melee items. Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. 


Rumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store. Season One begins on August 18</span>

                              <span>One of the fastest gaming laptops is a solid $400 off at Best Buy, bringing an Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition to just $1250. That&#x27;s an awesome price* for a laptop that comes with top-end AMD components, including a Ryzen 9 5900HX processor and RX 6800M graphics card, which for context should equal the performance of a good RTX 3080 gaming laptop. 
*By comparison, the same laptop costs £1500 (equivalent to $1770) in the UK, so y&#x27;all Americans are getting darn lucky with this one.

                              <span>Matthew is away this week, which leaves me and Nate to take over The Electronic Wireless Show podcast and turn it into a big ol&#x27; tower with loads of flamethrowers. That&#x27;s because we&#x27;re talking about our favourite towers in games. This means we need to draw a distinction between towers (the gamified concept as most popularly complained about in Ubisoft games) and towers (the architectural thing). Luckily, games have a lot of both.
Meanwhile, Nate&#x27;s fish issue (fisssue?) is growing worse, I am enjoying the local acts performing on the summer bandstand, and we talk about Lord Of The Rings and Lord Of The Rings related things. What fantasy creature would you like to conjure into real-life existence? We both said orc.

Announced today by PlayWay, the upcoming video game will attempt to use restaurant and cooking noises to provoke that &#x27;autonomous sensory meridian response&#x27; which has become a YouTube phenomenom. To some, it&#x27;s a delightful tingle on the neck. To others, it&#x27;s nothing, just weird noises. To me, it feels like spiders crawling beneath my skin and I hate it.

Marcus Stewart reviewed Shredder&#x27;s Revenge and awarded it an 8.75 out of 10. He concluded his review by saying, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge gives me what I wanted: a polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games. Turtles fans new and old will find plenty to love, but those possessing a nostalgia for this era of the franchise are in for the biggest treat. Invite some friends, order a pizza, and prepare to relive your childhood in the best possible way.&quot;</span>

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games&#x27; protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.
When Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

The hack-and-slash zombie game, Lollipop Chainsaw, might have received lukewarm reviews, but a remake is still on the way. Dragami Games president Yoshimi Yasuda took to Twitter today to let avid fans know it&#x27;ll &quot;be as close as possible to a remaster.&quot; You can check out his post below.
ロリポップチェーンソーリメイクに対し沢山のファンよりご質問を頂戴しましたのでお答えします…!!!

In his statement, Yasuda spoke about the primary goal of the remake and the incoming changes:
The original Lollipop Chainsaw was released in 2012 and was about high school cheerleader Juliet and her journey to survival amid a zombie apocalypse in California. For those of you that never played the game, you&#x27;re right to assume that Juliet donned a flesh-shredding chainsaw. Suda51 and James Gunn (The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy) collaborated on the gory, blood-pumping adventure. Joe Juba reviewed Lollipop Chainsaw and concluded his review by saying:
Are you excited to play the remake? What do you think of the statement? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, we reported on the relaunch of PlayStation Plus, a fusion of the original Plus and PlayStation Now benefits. Three tiers from cheapest to most expensive – Essential, Extra, and Premium – each offered downloadable games, with the latter two options providing game catalogs in the hundreds. According to the official PlayStation Blog, &quot;the inaugural Game Catalog lineup for the all-new PlayStation Plus&quot; drops for Extra and Premium members this month. Some of the titles include Stray and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. 
Your PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup for July includes:

Stray is a third-person adventure starring a stray cat navigating a cybercity to get home. As a cat, you can interact with the environment in amusing ways while unearthing an ancient mystery. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, one of my favorite games on PlayStation 5, retells the classic steampunk JRPG with a new-gen sheen. You even get to play as world-class ninja Yuffie in her own standalone Intermission Episode. 
The following games are also available on July 19:
Marvel’s Avengers | PS5, PS4
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity | PS4
Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV Black Flag | PS4
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue Remastered | PS4
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Freedom Cry | PS4
Assassin&#x27;s Creed: The Ezio Collection | PS4
Saints Row IV: Re-Elected | PS4
Saints Row Gat out of Hell | PS4
Spirit of the North: Enhanced Edition | PS5
Ice Age: Scrat&#x27;s Nutty Adventure | PS4

                              <span>During last September&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta&#x27;s reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. 


Platinum Games&#x27; enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You&#x27;ll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let&#x27;s not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It&#x27;s all wild and nonsensical as you&#x27;d expect but in the best possible way. 

Bayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.</span>

The music companies, for example, don&#x27;t want the ISP to argue that terminating Internet access is a human rights violation.

Bird Snapper is a nice little free game that&#x27;s just you, an endless grey desert, a bicycle, a howling night, and innumerable antennae and electricity pylons. A walking simulator on two wheels, with a bell.

                              <span>The better part of a decade ago, I got really into Gwent. Like, ‘stay up till 3 a.m. scouring The Witcher 3’s vast lands for new cards’ into Gwent. With Gwent: Rogue Mage, I can feel that drive slowly creeping in again. 
The latest spin-off from The Witcher trilogy (and technically the spin-off of the standalone Gwent spin-off), Gwent: Rogue Mage puts you in charge of two mages, Alzur and Lyliana, attempting to create the very first Witcher hundreds of years before Geralt’s adventures. They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments.

                              <span>Army Of Darkness, perhaps the best movie in Sam Raimi&#x27;s horror series, has hopped through time to arrive in Evil Dead: The Game with an update today. It brings a new map, two suitably medieval and marvellously chunky weapons, and some premium outfits. Hail to the King by watching the trailer below.

A block of crosses, squares, and circles like a snippet of an old GTA cheats page. Wonky boxes filled with letters, like a shed that&#x27;s just about held itself together after a storm. The rest? 1) WRO; 2) NYYVR; and other babblings of a newborn trying to make sense of the world. They might seem unhinged – they are, a bit – but they&#x27;re signs of an experience that was really quite fun, and incredibly, made me feel quite clever.

This is the more compact, tenkeyless version of the G915 that lives in our best gaming keyboard rankings, and those with Prime accounts can lop huge chunks off its retail price.

                              <span>Today is the second and final day of Prime Day 2022, which means sadly – assuming we’re setting an extremely low bar for things to consider sad – a lot of the best deals have been and gone. Nonetheless, there are still a fair few offers still running on the WD Blue SN570, a seasoned member of the best SSDs club owing to its high PCIe 3.0 speeds and relatively affordable pricing.


It’s even more affordable now, of course, especially if you’ve got an Amazon Prime account and are in the UK. The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.

                              <span>I would like to talk a little bit about my experience with The Invisible Guardian. Not the 2017 Spanish thriller movie, but the prodigiously popular Chinese visual novel that quickly became the highest-selling title on Steam in 2019. Why haven’t you heard of it? Because the game is strictly region locked. This is unfortunate, because The Invisible Guardian rules.

                              <span>Amazon Prime Day 2022 is entering its final hours, so last chance to take advantage of the best Prime Day PC gaming deals. While some good discounts vanished overnight (Prime Day is in fact two days, July 12th and 13th), the majority will keep running until the clock strikes midnight. To save you the bother of sifting through a mighty mountain of bargain bin junk, I&#x27;ve been collecting agreeable Amazon deals on actually good PC hardware right here.
Unlike the kinds of offers you’d find during, say, Black Friday, all the best Prime Day offers are only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. If you don&#x27;t have a membership, you could always sign up for Prime&#x27;s 30-day free trial - more on that in our guide to everything you need to know about Prime Day, which you can also find further down. Here&#x27;s some tips on how to find the best Prime Day deals for yourself, too.

Tempo RETBLEED není nijak závratné, na AMD Zen 2 (Ryzeny 3000 atd.) jsou data získávána rychlostí 3,9 kB/s, na Intel Coffee Lake (např. Core i7–8700) je to dokonce jen 219 B/s. V tuto chvíli je použitelnost útoku RETBLEED ověřena pro AMD Zen 1, 1+, 2 a Intel Core 6. až 8. generace (Skylake až Coffee Lake).</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is Game Informer&#x27;s latest cover story, and what&#x27;s a good cover story without a Rapid-Fire interview? Join us as we sit down with industry legend Takashi Iizuka, Sonic Team creative officer, and ask him 123 burning questions about The Blue Blur&#x27;s next big adventure, all in beautiful 4K!


Who better to lead today&#x27;s interview than one of GI&#x27;s biggest Sonic fans? Join Brian Shea as he sits down with Iikuza to chat about what fans can expect from Sonic Frontiers. They discuss what characters will appear in the upcoming title, the difference between open-world and open-zone, and so much more.
Iizuka isn&#x27;t just versed in the future of one of gaming&#x27;s icons, though. He&#x27;s also here to talk about his favorite titles of all time, comment on the beef between Sonic and Mario, and expound upon the fact that he didn&#x27;t actually know his hedgehog was going to appear in a recent Disney movie. What other secrets does the Sonic Team creative officer have up his sleeves? You&#x27;ll just have to watch the latest Rapid-Fire to find out!

                              <span>Kirby has a delicious-looking new multiplayer title heading to Switch this summer. Kirby’s Dream Buffet pits friends against each other in a platforming, snack-devouring race.
One to four players roll their Kirby through four rounds of food-themed obstacle courses, and whoever collects the most strawberries by the end wins. As seen in the trailer, players can use new cuisine-inspired copy abilities to gain the upper hand. That includes morphing into a cupcake that vacuums multiple food items or turning into sentient chocolate bars to perform Kirby’s signature rock slam. 


Kirby’s Dream Buffet supports local and online multiplayer and will be sold digitally and at retail for an unannounced price.</span>

                              <span>With temperatures rising in certain parts of the world and summer heat still going strong in North America, Nintendo issued a heatwave warning to Switch players, suggesting the console can only be used in temperatures up to 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we&#x27;d recommend not testing it. 
By way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan&#x27;s Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot. You can see the tweet below with a translation:
気温が高い場所でNintendo Switchを使用すると、本体の温度が高くなる場合があります。5～35℃の場所で使用してください。

                              <span>Supermassive Games is known for its interactive horror narratives, including 2015&#x27;s Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and, more recently, The Quarry. Today, Eurogamer reported that Danish company Nordisk Games acquired the studio.
Nordisk Games, which already owns Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios and MercurySteam, the team behind Metroid Dread, acquired a 30% stake in Supermassive in March 2021. At the time, Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels said:
Today, Samuels released another statement about the studios&#x27; full acquisition that matched his excitement from a year ago:
We enjoyed The Quarry, awarding the summer camp slasher an 8.5 out of 10 and concluding the review by saying, &quot;Once the frantic running through the woods begins, the dark mysteries and thrill of keeping people alive are powerful hooks that will keep you glued in suspense until the credits roll.&quot; However, the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Devil in Me, is Supermassive&#x27;s next big project. Starring Jessie Buckley, you can watch the trailer here.

                              <span>The US Copyright Claims board officially opened less than a month ago and there&#x27;s already a highly suspicious claim on the docket. The unknown “Copyrights Protection” outfit filed a case against pirate streaming app HA Sports Studio &#x27;on behalf&#x27; of Sky. However, Sky informs TorrentFreak that it has absolutely nothing to do with it.

Tests on EE connections currently yield mixed results but given the complex nature of the UK&#x27;s major mobile networks, coupled with the parameters of existing injunctions, plenty of questions remain unanswered.

They also unveiled new details about its second North African campaign this evening, which will offer a more traditional, narrative-led single-player experience compared to its more open-ended Italian campaigh, which was revealed last year. We had hoped to bring you more hands on details of this new campaign this evening, but in classic RTS fashion, things didn&#x27;t quite go according to plan. Sorry about that folks. Here are the headlines instead.

                              <span>Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.


The bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.

                              <span>If there’s a US-only Prime Day 2022 deal I wouldn’t mind seeing over here, it’s the Roccat Vulcan 120 for $88. That’s nearly a full 50% off the $160 RRP (I believe you aluminium mispronouncers call it “MSRP”), for a full-size mechanical keyboard that’s sat atop our best gaming keyboard rankings for ages.


What’s more, you don’t even have to limit yourself to Amazon – Best Buy are currently matching that price in their own sale.

                              <span>Between it being Prime Day 2022, and Valve drastically speeding up the rate at rate at which they&#x27;re shipping Steam Decks, now seems like an opportune time to check on whether you can save some cash on the best microSD cards for the handheld PC. Also because Liam just got his Deck and asked me about them this morning. So if you find these deals posts annoying, s’his fault.

UK studio Supermassive announced the buy-out today on Twitter, but did not share how much the acquisition will cost. 


The Copenhagen-based Nordisk is the world’s oldest continuously active movie production company, founded in 1906. Their Nordisk Games division has minority and majority stakes in six other development studios.

Amazon’s two-day “sod it, money off everything” event has brought the Basilisk V3 down to £35 in the UK, a price that appears to be an all-time low here in Blighty.

                              <span>If the word &quot;simulator&quot; in PowerWash Simulator puts you off, please don&#x27;t let it. Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you&#x27;re meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you&#x27;re meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.
After a year in early access, the game&#x27;s launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you&#x27;ll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.

Good on you, decent-ish sequel to several real-time strategy classics, for adding more multiplayer features, campaign unlocks and quality of life improvements.

But what if you don’t have the Amazon Prime subscription required to partake of them – or if you just don’t like Amazon? Cheap new peripherals/monitors/SSDs/other gubbins can still be yours, as plenty of other retailers are running sales this week to give Prime Day some healthy competition. In some cases they’ll even have the same kit as Amazon but at a matching or even better prices. Thus, this list, which gathers together all of the best anti-Prime Day deals I’ve found.

                              <span>If you were to distill the concept of Sonic Frontiers into an elevator pitch, it would likely involve the term &quot;open-world&quot; somewhere. However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an &quot;open-zone&quot; game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.
Coming off 2017&#x27;s Sonic Forces, a game that didn&#x27;t fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft has removed Assassin’s Creed: Liberation HD from Steam as part of a larger online “decommissioning” of several of its titles, most notably on PC. What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.
For context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it. 
Yesterday, Twitter user Nors3 shared a screen capture of Liberation HD’s now-defunct Steam page, displaying a notice that states, &quot;At the request of the pub…</span>

                              <span>According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don&#x27;t mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.
Referred to as &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title,&quot; a Senior Environment Artist post states:
A single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers&#x27; eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk&#x27;s notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.
What do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below.

The public tracker, which doesn&#x27;t host any torrent files, was run by the original YTS group before it was shut down by the MPA. Demonii wasn&#x27;t targeted by this shutdown and has now been handed over to a new owner, who was surprised to see millions of peers still connecting to it.

                              <span>A DMCA subpoena application filed in a California court is seeking to identify potentially tens of thousands of people for being part of Roblox groups, some of which contain members allegedly involved in game piracy. Christopher Boomer&#x27;s games already have billions of legitimate views, with his copyrights and trademark filings hinting at a beyond-luxury lifestyle.

                              <span>I had expected to dislike Riders Republic because Ubisoft&#x27;s marketing made the open-world xtreme sports game look like it was about gnarly middle-aged dudes with sikk lingo and twatty hats. And it is, and they are awful. But behind the rude &#x27;tude and Fortnite-grade fashion, Riders Republic makes riding a virtual bike feel like riding a real one in a way few video games manage. Switch to the first-person camera, turn off the music and HUD, and just cycle through American national parks with your bike humming beneath you. Bliss.

                              <span>I have long been on the &quot;eh, seems okay&quot; side of the fence regarding Valve&#x27;s newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go &quot;Oh yeah!&quot;, pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. 
Last week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. &quot;This is great!&quot;, I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that&#x27;s when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you&#x27;re looking for. So now I want a Switch.

                              <span>After over a decade of game development, Last Call BBS is the curtain call for prolific indie studio Zachtronics. Released only a month after the studio casually announced it would be disbanding, Last Call BBS will be the last game the studio releases. It&#x27;s a bittersweet feeling for fans, but this final game is not just a goodbye, it&#x27;s a retrospective dive into the studio’s ten-year-plus run making games. It also acts as a reminder of how flipping good Zachtronics is at making puzzle games, even if they do melt my brain into a puddle.

Abe was shot dead on Friday. Online commenters making some very bad-taste jokes about the identity of the shooter led to a Greek media outlet and French politician misidentifying him as Kojima.

Now, Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD, Space Junkies and Silent Hunter 5 have already been delisted from Steam at Ubisoft’s request, and won&#x27;t be accessible from September 1st.

It&#x27;s not certain yet exactly what day or time the beta begins, but anyone looking to team up with friends for the beta will need to have been part of the Halo Insider program for at least three months and have an Insider Xp level of 5 or higher. The preview will be available for both purchased copies of Halo Infinite and to players using Game Pass for PC. Steam players will be sent a unique key to access the relevant build through Halo Insider.

However, these takedowns are not without harm either. Some artists are having their work taken down in bad faith by rival musicians; a problem that&#x27;s particularly hard to counter on Spotify.

                              <span>Two top-tier European football leagues have been successful in their latest bids to have pirate IPTV services blocked by internet service providers. Following applications filed this year by LaLiga and a Serie A rightsholder in Malta, three local ISPs have been ordered to block IP addresses and servers on demand. Yet again in an IPTV blocking case, a secret agreement lies behind the scenes.

Turns out it wasn&#x27;t, it was one of several pieces of &quot;fake game art&quot; created by Valve artist Claire Hummel as part of the Steam summer sale. Now that the sale is over, Hummel shared all of the made-up key art on Twitter, and it&#x27;s all great.

More impressively, they all look like games I want to play.

The games are Ancient Enemy and Killing Floor 2, and it&#x27;s the latter that triggered the memory trip for me - because it was also free on Epic this week two years ago. But hey, if you missed it, the zombie shooter still one of the best co-op games, so grab it while you can.

                              <span>Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven&#x27;t posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. 
But man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it&#x27;s quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke&#x27;s on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I&#x27;m just quite glad I&#x27;ve (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.

The few I tried were fussy, though, and too much like the kind of cold scientific procedure that turns growing things into industry. With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.
It&#x27;s a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There&#x27;s no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.

As it&#x27;s his first rodeo, we keep this episode fairly relaxed and get to know a bit more about our new pod bud, then follow it up with our Point Of Interest: Summer Geoff Fest. Namely, the shooters and shootery things that caught our eyes from its many showcases.

Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I&#x27;ve watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.
So, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard&#x27;s gooch. And I think I&#x27;m enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.

                              <span>Madison is a fun game to write about. It&#x27;s a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca&#x27;s (that&#x27;s you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, &quot;fun&quot; here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.
The game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it&#x27;s about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn&#x27;t that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You&#x27;ve got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don&#x27;t have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve said before that the greatest chronicle of English culture is a Duke Nukem 3D level, and that continues to be true. In a bleak country full of absurd events happening at breakneck pace, modder Dan Douglas is doing his best to capture them in his level, Duke Smoochem 3D. Barely a day after British prime minister Boris Johnson announced his intent to resign, Douglas has already added it to his yet-unfinished level. And yes, he&#x27;s made it even sillier.

                              <span>Rockstar have confirmed that they won’t support their digital Westworld of Red Dead Online with any further major content updates, as the development of the next Grand Theft Auto takes priority. The news came via a post on Rockstar’s newswire blog. Players among the Red Dead Online community have been vocal about their disappointment at the game’s apparent lack of support, with some even deciding to organise a funeral for the multiplayer cowboy spin-off scheduled for July 13th.

                              <span>Interactive horror flick The Quarry has finally got its online multiplayer mode, which arrived in a free update last night. Devs Supermassive Games are referring to the multiplayer as ‘Wolf Pack’, which makes me wish Zach Galifianakis would pop up to comment on your playthrough. Refresh your memory about Hacket’s Quarry by watching the launch trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the early access experience of Vampire Survivors, hopping back on every few weeks to check out a new update and do all the new stuff (and make all the new explosions). The roguelikelike survival arcade game has grown a lot, and fast, especially considering it started as a solo project. As it nears version 1.0, the latest big update has added a new final boss to the final level, a flashy battle.

                              <span>Nobody likes mannequins, except maybe Andrew McCarthy. Nobody likes dead bodies being puppeted around out much either, except maybe Andrew McCarthy. That’s why I’m slightly disappointed that Supermassive Games didn&#x27;t hire the legendary 1980s actor to star in The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me, which revealed a little more about its spooky murder doll house in a new story trailer. I’m sure you’ll be thoroughly creeped out when you watch it below.

                              <span>Modders have been getting busy with FSR 2.0, AMD’s latest, recently open source-ified, Nvidia DLSS-esque upscaling tech. First someone got FSR 2.0 working in Cyberpunk 2077, then someone modded the Cyberpunk mod to get FSR in Dying Light 2, and then someone discovered the mod of the mod could also mod Metro Exodus. Now, redditor Muddymind has figured out how to tweak the Metro mod so that it can act as an Nvidia DLAA clone, skipping the upscaling bit to solely provide better image quality and anti-aliasing.

                              <span>Protect the innocent and uphold the law. That&#x27;s what Robocop is programmed to do, and you&#x27;ll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic &#x27;80s character.
The trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop&#x27;s precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.
Teyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting one of the best, and most underrated, Pokémon games from the Nintendo 64 library in Pokémon Puzzle League next week.
On July 15, the Panel de Pon-style, tile-matching puzzle game joins the (gradually) growing roster of classic N64 games. Pokémon Puzzle League launched in 2000 and tells an original story based on the anime, with Ash and Pikachu competing in a special puzzle tournament. The pair takes on familiar faces, including Team Rocket and Gary, in 2D and 3D puzzle contests, with plenty of Pokémon cheering from the sidelines. 


Pokémon Snap joined Switch Online last month, making today’s news a nice double-whammy for Pokémon fans. You can keep up with every game available across the various Switch Online libraries by checking out our evolving database.</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum&#x27;s long journey to release nears its end, and after getting a release date and story trailer in May, curious fans can finally see what gameplay looks like in a new video. 
A short trailer provides a montage of the stealth-oriented gameplay as well as Gollum’s emphasis on climbing and platforming to traverse Middle-earth landmarks. The game looks noticeably rough considering it’s launching in two months which is worrisome, but hopefully, it plays better than it appears at the moment. 


The Lord of the Rings: Gollum launches September 1 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also coming to Switch sometime later this year.</span>

                              <span>The founder of Florida-based VPN company TorGuard is listed as the prime suspect in a Greek fraud case. The authorities hold Ben Van Pelt personally responsible for roughly €2,000 in attempted fraudulent transactions carried out by an anonymous user of the service. Van Pelt&#x27;s legal team say the incredible allegations and a potential five-year prison sentence are hard to justify.

The decision, which overrules the opinion of a lower court, essentially gives so-called &#x27;copyright trolls&#x27; a green light to press ahead with cash settlement demands on a scale of their choosing.

So much so, I thought it was a homage to Bloodborne&#x27;s best bits. And at today&#x27;s Nacon Connect, developers Spiders unveiled a new trailer which shows ballerina-turned-bodyguard Aegis fight off some metallic monstrosities, mixed in with a bit of parkour. Seriously, I&#x27;m excited for this one.

                              <span>Today’s Nacon Connect event included gritty antiheroes such as the Terminator and RoboCop, but I never would’ve expected to see Robin Hood there too. Appeal Studios’ Gangs Of Sherwood is an upcoming third-person PvE co-op action game that puts you in the dainty shoes of the Merry Men. This time though, it’s set in a dystopian future instead of Ye Merry Olde England. Watch the announcement teaser below to see what you think of that.

                              <span>A new The Lord Of The Rings: Gollum trailer has dropped at today&#x27;s Nacon Connect, which shows Mr Precious scamper about in some suitably fantastical locations. He hops between some bushes, dodges a dragon, and chucks something at an orc - all the staples of a Hobbit who&#x27;s gone goblin mode. I&#x27;m still a bit on the fence about it, though.

Will you be able to play as Terminators? It&#x27;s not yet clear. Heck, it&#x27;s so early on the game doesn&#x27;t even have a proper name yet. Feel free to recoil in fear from the announcement teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Robocop: Rogue City aims to be authentic to the first three films in the series, which means it&#x27;ll either be a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be human and a cutting satire of American culture, or it&#x27;ll be about fighting robot ninjas and having a jetpack. Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it&#x27;ll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that Skull And Bones has had a somewhat troubled development. Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate &#x27;em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there&#x27;s still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won&#x27;t catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that&#x27;s for sure.

From another angle, it makes total sense when you consider that the outcome of it all was info about BG3’s musically-tinged eighth patch, arriving later today. We’re finally getting those gnome bards, fam. You can check out the stream for yourselves below.

                              <span>The first unusual thing about Symphony Of War Colon The Nephilim Saga is that it&#x27;s a strategy game made in RPG Maker. That&#x27;s not particularly unusual, but it leads into the second unusual thing: that it&#x27;s also a good strategy game. The third unusual thing is one I didn&#x27;t even appreciate until I was a fair bit in: it&#x27;s not only a good strategy game &quot;for an RPG Maker game&quot;, but one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year.

Consequently, their stuff is often very competitive on price, and today we have a new low water mark for their P41 SSD thanks to a 15% off coupon at Amazon US. 
The massive 2TB model is now going for $221, down from $260, which is the lowest price we can find on a ~7000MB/s NVMe SSD of this capacity.

News of the game&#x27;s resurrection (after a long delay) came today in a 20-minute Ubisoft Forward livestream that included a brief look at stunning new gameplay footage.

The world of Aionios is in a perpetual state of war, endlessly engulfed in flame and littered with corpses. Countries Keves and Agnus love to hate each other, and both factions&#x27; armies pay the price. To make matters worse, these seemingly mass-produced soldiers are cursed with short, 10-year lifespans. The goal, then, is to endure front-line service and be forever immortalized in the Homecoming ceremony, an honorable send-off for Aionios&#x27; most tenacious survivors. 
I meet Noah, Eunie, and Lanz, during the latter stage of their lifespans (or terms). The leading trio has slain their fair share of Agnusians and watched many beloved…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation Twitter account posted a small batch of announcements highlighting upcoming indie games headed to PlayStation. While Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4. 


Inscryption
One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time. The PS5/PS4 version of the horror deck builder features exclusive features, such as the talking Stoat card&#x27;s audio coming through the controller speaker, haptic feedback support, and atmospheric lighting that, accordion to creator Daniel Mullens, &quot;spills out from your controller.&quot; We&#x27;re not sure what …</span>

                              <span>Supermassive Games has released a new story trailer for The Devil In Me, the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today&#x27;s new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it&#x27;s a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.” 

This set is notable for Lego, too, because it utilizes newly-created Lego elements to recreate the look of Bowser’s iconic back spikes. Plus, it featur…</span>

                              <span>Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

                              <span>Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Lenneth is the 2006 enhanced PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile, which first arrived in North America in 2000. Lenneth came to mobile devices in 2018 but it hasn’t been available on a home console since the original version arrived on PS1. 
Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth comes to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29, the same day that Valkyrie Elysium launches. It will be sold separately for a yet-to-be-announced price. You can also get it as part of the $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition of Valkyrie Elysium.</span>

                              <span>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

                              <span>Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don&#x27;t worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.</span>

That&#x27;s because, alongside that cinematic &quot;Father and Son&quot; trailer, the studio has released a new unboxing video for the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s and Jötnar editions. 
As you might expect, both editions of Ragnarok look fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that both come in a fancy Knowledge Keeper&#x27;s Shrine box that features beautiful artwork and plenty of fun goodies inside. Check them both out for yourself in the trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, you can&#x27;t go wrong with either edition. But, if you&#x27;re like me and struggling to determine which one you want, hopefully this breakdown of what&#x27;s in each wil…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018&#x27;s God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we&#x27;re less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic &quot;Father and Son&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won&#x27;t spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok&#x27;s take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.</span>

                              <span>Guerrilla Games and PlayStation have been steady at work, making Horizon Forbidden West an even better game than it was at launch with updates that add transmog, fix visual shimmering, improve graphics, and more. Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. 
More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…</span>

                              <span>Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita&#x27;s original vision of Live a Live, we&#x27;re getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it&#x27;s brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It&#x27;s Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don&#x27;t offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.</span>

                              <span>Capcom recently announced a 10-game Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, bundling together the six Game Boy Advance Battle Network titles and the various versions that were originally released. I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …</span>
