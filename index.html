                    <span>Telltale Games went through a resurrection and reinvention after its shutdown in 2018, but returned shortly after with a return to one of its fan-favorite series in 2019: The Wolf Among Us 2. We learned more about the game in December of 2020 and then Telltale Games shared some more a year later, shortly after Game Informer’s feature about this new iteration of the studio, its Wolf Among Us sequel, and its upcoming game based on The Expanse went live. 
If you’re still craving some more information about The Wolf Among Us 2, then you’re in luck because Telltale Games has some more information to share this week. More specifically, the studio has announced a behind-the-scenes look at the game happening this Wednesday, February 9, at 10 a.m. PT/Noon CT/1 p.m. EST.

As you can see in the tweet above, we’re all heading back to Fabletown this week. However, it doesn’t sound like we’ll be getting a trailer for the game or a look at gameplay. Considering Telltale Games used the words “behind-the-scenes” specifically, we expect just that – a look at what’s happening under the hood, maybe some concept art, and more. Only time will tell, though. 
While waiting for Wednesday, check out Game Informer’s The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 review and then watch this Wolf Among Us 2 trailer. Read about Telltale Games’ upcoming series based on The Expanse after that.

Join Dan Tack and Alex Van Aken to discuss 10-hours with the game, diving into various features, mechanics, and details. During the conversation, we chatted about some new information that didn’t make it into the cover story itself, along with some broad takeaways from the game.

                    <span>FromSoftware&#x27;s catalog of games is synonymous with sweeping narrative design and challenging combat, the latter leading to some particularly memorable boss battles for millions of Soulsborne players. There are simply too many exciting encounters to list between all of Miyazaki&#x27;s acclaimed projects. Good thing a bunch of PlayStation developers picked some of their favorite FromSoftware bosses and spoke about the combat design and spectacle of each fight. Even Miyazaki chimed in on the boss he&#x27;s most proud of!

                    <span>Shinji Mikami is a horror legend in gaming, having directed the first Resident Evil, which spawned off an entire franchise with over a dozen entries in it today. He then left Capcom to create Tango Gameworks, now owned by Bethesda, which is where Mikami began his new horror series, The Evil Within. After a sequel, the team began work on GhostWire Tokyo, which is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and PC on March 25. 
While Mikami’s mind is probably mostly focused on the yokai-filled streets of Tokyo, that didn’t stop him from reminiscing about his most well-known horror series, Resident Evil. In a new interview with Newsweek, Mikami explained that he believes there’s ways Resident Evil 4 could be improved. More specifically, he said if rumors of Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 remake are true, he not …</span>

                    <span>Google Stadia has mostly been fighting an uphill battle since its announcement. Not only was the technology new, which is always a struggle even with a name like Google behind the service, but its launch largely failed to make game streaming waves in the industry. It was released just a year before the expected launch of new-gen consoles like the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, too, and shortly after the launch of those consoles, Google announced it was ending first-party game development and closing two of its internal Stadia studios. 
Now, the latest nail in Stadia’s coffin is reportedly being hammered in, as reported by Business Insider. According to Business Insider’s new report, Google is attempting to salvage the Stadia service under the new name of “Google Stream.” At the same ti…</span>

                    <span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released less than two weeks ago but it’s already a hit. Not only did it review really well – Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10 – but it sold a massive 6.5 million copies in just seven days. A new mystery gift distribution might get more players excited to jump back into the Hisui region, or it might get those on the fence to finally pick up the game. 
News of this incoming mystery gift distribution event comes by way of Serebii.net, which spotted signage for the event. Serebii notes that the event seems to be exclusive to GameStop and will run from February 25 through March 13. It will give players a Hisuian Growlithe and 20 Feather Balls.

Now, as some have pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t necessarily the most exciting mystery gift distribution. A Hisuian Growlithe isn’t exactly rare – although for some, finding one could take hours – and 20 Feather Balls won’t cost you too much in-game. However, it doesn’t hurt to receive a free Pokémon and some useful Feather Balls. 
No further details have been released for the event just yet, but considering there’s still a few weeks before its start, it’s not surprising. As we near the February 25 start date for the mystery gift distribution event, expect more details about it to be revealed. 
While waiting for more information, be sure to read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then check out these three new Pokémon Pop! figures recently revealed. Read Game Informer’s 10 tips and tricks to know before starting Pokémon Legends: Arceus after that.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 was released just last week and its player counts quickly overtook the all-time high of the first Dying Light. After a weekend of players running through Techland’s new city, Villedor, the studio has released a list of hotfixes and improvements coming to the zombie parkour game soon. 
As expected, there are different bugs and things to fix on different platforms. The issues PC players are running into aren’t necessarily what’s being seen on PlayStation and what’s being seen on PlayStation isn’t necessarily what’s happening on Xbox consoles.

                    <span>Now we just need gamer toast.
No one ever thinks of the gamers. We have had to suffer through decades of disrespect, forced to eat regular, non-gamer meals with the rest of the normies. They say that some foods are the &quot;breakfast of champions&quot;, but what about the Smash Bros. champions, huh? What about the people who always win at Mario Kart Grand Prix 200CC Baby Park, Mr Kellogg? Will nobody help the poor gamers?
Yes. Our saviour is here, and it&#x27;s peanut butter-shaped.

It&#x27;s a pleasing part of the Switch life that fascinating Indie titles often have an eShop version planned alongside the usual PC build. Another to join the watch-list is The Perfect Pencil, which looks like an intriguing and rather beautiful game.
It&#x27;ll be the debut release of Studio Cima, which was formed back in 2019. The team highlights titles like Hollow Knight and Celeste as sources of inspiration, which certainly comes through in the announcement footage. It also has its own distinct style, however, along with interesting ideas for its storytelling.

How do you convey the fact that a scene is set in Paris? Easy: You put an Eiffel Tower in the background. But what if the players don&#x27;t notice it? What if it&#x27;s not enough? That&#x27;s where you have to get creative. Add a chap on a bicycle, wearing a striped shirt, perhaps. Maybe sprinkle in some croissants falling from the sky, which is what rain looks like in France.
Or, if you&#x27;re a developer working on the Bioshock Infinite &quot;Burial At Sea&quot; DLC, just add a little lad triumphantly holding a baguette high in the air, as he dances around a pole covered in Art Nouveau posters while Edith Piaf sings La Vie En Rose in the background. Subtlety be damned!

                    <span>The Bears offence is rubbish in this, too.
(American) Football is a surprisingly complicated sport; it may not look like it as we watch enormous humans endanger themselves while wearing a lot of padding, but it&#x27;s a game with playbooks and elaborate calls that sound to the uninitiated like the outbursts of lunatics. For most of us fans it&#x27;s a simple but incredibly satisfying game, with few things better than a skilled quarterback dropping back, surveying the landscape and releasing a perfect throw just as a hulk of a defender brings them down.
That&#x27;s the feeling Retro Bowl shoots for, along with the classic 8-bit vibe of Tecmo Bowl on NES. Before now a popular mobile game that&#x27;s gone a bit viral on TikTok, it arrives on Switch with a very modest price and having been carefully balanced for the system. The developers have spent their time well, as you wouldn&#x27;t know this was previously a mobile game from playing it on Switch — and it even supports the NES and SNES Switch Online pads if you&#x27;re feeling really old-school.

                    <span>We&#x27;ll have to do a reprint for the headline.
Resident Evil: Revelations came out on 3DS 10 years ago today in North America (it was late January in Japan and Europe but we missed that date, ok?). It was particularly famous at launch for its &#x27;Revelaitons&#x27; box misprint, which became one of the more humorous collectibles in the 3DS era.
Since that original release it&#x27;s been HD-ified and ported to pretty much everything, including Wii U and Switch. That said, we have a soft spot for the 3DS original (and timed exclusive!) and for the era it represented. It arrived shortly after the beleaguered 3DS had started its fightback - the system had already had a drastic price cut and major releases the preceding Christmas. It was also the game that introduced the &#x27;Circle Pad Pro&#x27; to the West, after the peripheral was released in Japan alongside Monster Hunter 3 G the previous December. They were released together, and it was a delightfully chunky thing.

An attempted bank robbery took place in Florida last week, with the suspect wearing a Sonic the Hedgehog mask.
According to the West Volusia Beacon, local law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Florida Credit Union in DeLand on February 2nd after they were informed that an armed robbery was in progress.

If you don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re talking about, check out the first puppet advert for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured a chaotic Munchlax on a cooking show, and the second, which combined Antiques Roadshow with a very wiggly Basculegion, and perhaps you&#x27;ll notice a trend: With the phrase &quot;Pokémon, but not as you know it&quot;, these adverts are combining classic TV genres with unexpected Pokémon guest appearances.

You&#x27;re probably aware, but a lot of Switch owners have been enjoying Pokémon Legends: Arceus over the past couple of weeks, with social media full of people sharing mini reviews, references, cute things or just general lore. One cool instance we&#x27;ve seen (hat-tip Kotaku) is Japanese fans convinced that a particular Trainer&#x27;s motion when throwing a Poké-ball is mimicking a popular Japanese baseball pitcher.

Triangle Strategy, Square Enix&#x27;s latest HD-2D tactical RPG and successor to the wonderful Octopath Traveler, is right around the corner, and plenty of pre-order options are starting to appear for those already sold on the game.
Launching on 4th March 2022, Triangle Strategy will throw you into brand new turn-based battles where you&#x27;ll need to position your units carefully, including on higher ground, to take control of the battlefield and gain the advantage. It certainly sounds like it&#x27;ll be a good time:

                    <span>A decade on, a new day has dawned.
It’s rather hard to believe, but this July will mark the 10-year anniversary of the initial launch of Rune Factory 4 for the 3DS. Since then, the farm sim genre arguably hasn’t seen much innovation or notable movement, other than the release of a certain indie gem that hardly needs any introduction. Still, it’s nice to see that Rune Factory stuck around and wasn’t another casualty that came with the death of dedicated Nintendo handhelds; we’re happy to report that, so far, this new entry seems like it’ll be every bit as enjoyable as we could’ve hope. On the other hand, Rune Factory 5 also doesn’t feel like a very new game, which is to say that it doesn’t appear like it’ll shake up the genre or series at all.
Rune Factory 5 — which launched in Japan in May 2021 — picks up in the expected way, with your self-insert protagonist arriving in town having no memory of their past beyond their name. In the hopes that you’ll eventually recover, the town’s locals take you in and welcome you into the community, but not without first press-ganging you into joining SEED. SEED is a military unit that handles security around town, and it seems that they’re a little short-staffed upon your arrival.

Ace Attorney, the game about lawyer Phoenix Wright getting his clients acquitted, already has a live-action movie adaptation — and an anime, and a stage production — but all of them were made for the Japanese audience, amongst whom the game is much more popular than in the West.
It&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll ever get a live-action film in English detailing the exploits of Phoenix and friends, but we can dream... and that dream would involve these fan-made posters being displayed in cinemas everywhere.

                    <span>Wunderful!
Back in March 2020 a neat little puzzle platformer called Wunderling put you in the shoes of the lowliest of platforming foes trying desperately to take down the &#x27;hero&#x27; of the piece and please a villainous boss. The game was a fun and fresh spin on a genre that has more than a few video games to its name, and Swedish developer Bitwave Games (formerly Retroid Interactive) has now announced that it is getting an upgrade in the form of Wunderling DX, a free update coming on 8th March.
Wunderling DX adds a whole new world containing 14 levels where you continue to thwart the efforts of Carrot Man, hero of the Vegetable Kingdom. As well as the new levels, there are also new items, story beats and a speedrun timer included. This update will be the last one for the game and a bookend for Bitwave Games as it bids farewell to its old &#x27;Retroid Interactive&#x27; banner.

                    <span>Independent sacrifice.
Firing up Swords &amp; Bones, we were taken with a sudden sentimentality for the days of the bedroom coder, when newsagents held a revolving rack of Commodore or Spectrum cassette tape games emblazoned with wonderful cover art. This nostalgia smack could partly be down to the game’s intro sequence illustrations looking like they’ve been drawn by an unskilled ten-year old; it could be because its structure feels like something from the Commodore 64 library. It’s hard to say, but it’s there.
This isn’t programmer SEEP’s first rodeo. Some of his previous titles include Thunderflash, an Ikari Warriors-style, top-down run n’ gun, and scrolling beat-em-up Dragon Climax. Swords &amp; Bones, a product of both 8 and 16-bit stimuli, is an amalgam of inspirations: A lump sum of Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins, a pinch of Castlevania, and a dab of Shovel Knight.

The interview, which has been partially translated by our friend over at VGC, touches upon topics such as recruitment and expansion, but the most interesting segment relates to Inaba&#x27;s vision for Platinum&#x27;s future output.

                    <span>A chance to share your thoughts on the system.
The Nintendo Switch will soon be 5 years old, which is quite a landmark; it&#x27;s still showing incredible momentum and has already outsold the Wii. It&#x27;s at that point in the generation where plenty are wondering how much longer it&#x27;ll be Nintendo&#x27;s main system, and our habits as owners will also be evolving as the library grows.
Also coming into its fifth year is The State of Switch Survey, which is run by Switch Weekly. It typically draws over 10,000 submissions each year, with the 15 minute survey covering topic ranging from your gaming habits, which system iterations you own, your opinion on the system&#x27;s durability, features you want to see and much more besides.

                    <span>And Konami is giving away gems to celebrate.
Remember when we told you that Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel had racked up 4 million downloads? Well, you can scratch that, because Konami has just revealed that it has now passed 10 million downloads across all formats. Cor!
Master Duel is available on all major consoles, PC and smartphones – which would go some way to explaining how it has managed to shift so many units in less than a month. Oh, and it&#x27;s free to play, which will also have helped massively, we&#x27;d imagine.

Remember the first time you saw a Nintendo 3DS running? The glass-free 3D effect was truly mind-blowing, and there&#x27;s still a part of us that is deeply sad that the technology proved to be something of a dead-end.
Still, if you&#x27;ve got a hankering for something along the same lines and you have exceptionally deep pockets, then you might be interested to learn that game designer Seth A. Robinson has come up with a way of playing the likes of Super Mario Bros. and Castlevania on a $400 Looking Glass Factory holographic display.

                    <span>Over half of the top 10 are Switch titles, too.
The UK physical retail charts for last week are now out, and once again they tell a positive story for Switch exclusives (and even in one case a Switch version that sells surprisingly well).
On top for a second week is Pokémon Legends: Arceus; what makes that impressive is that it&#x27;s held off the much anticipated multi-platform release of Dying Light 2: Stay Human. Of course this only accounts for physical retail, but that applies to both games; it&#x27;s indicative of strong ongoing momentum.

Unless you&#x27;ve been living under a rock for the past few weeks, you&#x27;ll know about Wordle.
It&#x27;s a web-based word game created by Josh Wardle in which players are given six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Coloured tiles tell you if your guesses are correct or not. It has taken the world by a storm, so much so that The New York Times handed over an undisclosed seven-figure sum last month to buy it.

Capcom recently revived its hard-as-nails series Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins in the form of Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins Resurrection, a superb action platformer that represents a series test of your reflexes and skills.
It would seem that Arthur&#x27;s time in the limelight isn&#x27;t over yet, either, as he&#x27;s being immortalised in plastic thanks to the kind folks over at Good Smile.

                    <span>Death&#x27;s Door is a great little game. I&#x27;ve been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there&#x27;s only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death&#x27;s Door. Like Katharine said, it&#x27;s kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death&#x27;s Door, because it&#x27;s still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

                    <span>The creators of skateboarding game OlliOlli World sent word that Danny Trejo, of Danny Trejo fame, would feature in their video game. After filing our OlliOlli World review, I investigated and, yup, you stumble across him in one particularly fiendish level, where he is being used as promotional bait by a scheming business frog. Good thing no real company would stoop so low as to use Daniel T&#x27;s likeness in such a cynical, ultimately successful way. 
Ahem. Well, if Danny Trejo can show up in this kickflip &#x27;em up, what other cameos may appear? We used the game&#x27;s character customisation menu to cook up some possibilities.

                    <span>One year after announcing a paid expansion for Factorio, the developers still haven&#x27;t revealed much of what it&#x27;ll bring. But they have now confirmed something that might not be big but is large: they plan for the expansion to feel as big as the whole base game all over again. Factorio is not a small game, so that&#x27;s an impressive plan.

                    <span>Whether you dislike NFTs, don&#x27;t understand them, or think you can make money from them, you can&#x27;t escape the NFT discourse. Game stores are no different. Valve have banned games with NFTs or cryptocurrencies from Steam, the Epic Games Stores welcomes NFTs, and now Itch.io has weighed in. In response to people asking, the folks behind the excellent indie games store have stated their beliefs plainly: &quot;NFTs are a scam.&quot;

                    <span>So, there&#x27;s this South Korean MMORPG called Mir4 that&#x27;s been out on mobile and PC for about six months now. It&#x27;s free-to-play, so it started off with decent numbers, but from October to November the monthly average player count jumped up by 32k. It&#x27;s tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you&#x27;d think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That&#x27;s right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

                    <span>Following the launch of Dying Light 2 on Friday, developers Techland have been working to fix lingering technical issues. Over the weekend they laid out their plans for patching the open-world zombie-masher, with fixes for a number of crashes, issues blocking progress through the story, issues leading to a &quot;death loop&quot; (not that sort) and more. They haven&#x27;t said when exactly PC patches will hit, but sounds like soon?

                    <span>I can’t skate. At this point. I’ll never be able to do it. But, I can (and do) play skateboarding video games. They let me live out my skater punk fantasies without breaking any bones. And soon, I’ll have a new game to scratch that skateboard itch when OlliOlli World drops in on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC later…

Mastering a martial art takes years – if not a lifetime. Disciples must hone their bodies to the point that they perform every attack, every counter, every movement with pinpoint precision. A skilled warrior must move without thinking. Likewise, mastering Sifu&#x27;s combat system takes a high degree of dedication and practice. Like a true martial artist, you must push through the practice pains before you reap any rewards.
In 2017, Sloclap released the martial arts-themed action/RPG Absolver, which let players design their own combat system as they battled other online players in a …</span>

It&#x27;s been a while since we got a sales update about Capcom&#x27;s other Monster Hunter game, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, so how is it going? The Nintendo Switch and PC release have now shifted over 1.5 million copies worldwide.
This follows on from an update last October - confirming 1.3 million sales. In its latest financial results, Capcom mentioned how Wings of Ruin contributed to &quot;solid digital sales growth&quot; for the company and &quot;continued to perform well&quot;.

                    <span>Putting the monsters back in your pocket.
There&#x27;s not a person alive who doesn&#x27;t know what Pokémon is these days, not a single soul who couldn&#x27;t correctly point out Pikachu in a line up of every pocket monster there has ever been. The series&#x27; success has seen it spread its easily merchandised charms to all corners of commercialism, from Funko Pops to painfully expensive handmade headphones. We all know what it is, because there&#x27;s no escaping Pokémon or its message of working hard to be best friends with a colourful and compliant pocketable pal. There are new Pokémon, old Pokémon, regional Pokémon, and removed Pokémon but they all amount to the same thing; a bundle of stats to inevitably catch and battle with, another thing for the internet to draw cute fanart of. Pokémon are pleasant, predictable, and passive — until now.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus is quick to rewrite everything we think we know about the series; so quick we don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s happening. Why is everyone so afraid of battling pokémon, when that&#x27;s what Pokémon games are for? And why are they all talking about how dangerous the world outside the village is with a steely seriousness that can&#x27;t be anything other than a bad attempt at a joke? ‘But what if you get killed?’ Killed? By a Pokémon? Hah, right!

                    <span>While the Apple M1 SoC is a great piece of hardware, a large part of what has made Apple Silicon so successful with their newest Macs has been their Rosetta 2 software for dynamically translating x86/x86_64 software to run well on these 64-bit Arm systems. Existing applications and games optimized for prior Intel Macs continue running generally in excellent shape on their newest hardware thanks to Rosetta 2. While there is the ongoing Linux bring-up work for Apple Silicon on Linux, the open-source world doesn&#x27;t currently have that advantage of a compelling Rosetta 2 alternative but the FEX-Emu project hopes to change that outlook...</span>

                    <span>As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be Jackie Chan. Not the actual guy, but the version of him in those movies, where he could clear out entire rooms using luck, martial arts and whatever he had within arm’s reach. Well, with Sifu, my childhood dream is now a reality. You don’t need to be a kung fu film fanatic to appreciate this action game, though. It’s not a tired bundle of tropes packaged together with an ironic detachment. It’s a passionate celebration of what makes the genre so good. It looks at the classics, then the modern descendants of that style, and finally puts its own unique twist on the whole thing.

                    <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN is leaving no stone unturned to hold the one-time largest pirate IPTV trader in the Netherlands to account.

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. It&#x27;s time to bring Season 2 to a close as we examine Halo Infinite, the most recent entry that served as both a return to form and a dramatic reinvention for the franchise. 
Halo Infinite launched December 8, 2021 (though its multiplayer launched in open beta a month prior). After the mixed reception to Halo 5: Guardians, 343 Industries undertook its longest development cycle yet creating Halo Infinite. 343 Industries clashed over its numerous ideas for the title&#x27;s direction, and an infamous first showing in 2020 led to Infinite being delayed a full year as it was originally slated as an Xbox Series X/S launch title. The extra time paid off. Halo Infinite launched to largely positive reception, including snagging Game Informer&#x27;s coveted Game of the Year award. How did 343 pull the nose up? What role does Halo Wars 2 have on the narrative? Where does 343 take the series going forward? Tune in as we discuss those burning questions and more. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) along with Game Informer&#x27;s Magazine Content Director/resident Halo expert Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) as we explore Halo Infinite&#x27;s creation and immediate impact on the franchise. You&#x27;ll also want to stick around for the announcement of the game series we&#x27;ll be covering in Season 3!

                    <span>Meta is adding a new system called &quot;Personal Boundary&quot; to Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues, two of their virtual reality apps. It&#x27;s designed to curb creepy behaviour within the company&#x27;s much-hyped metaverse by preventing other player&#x27;s from invading your personal space.

                    <span>Wordle is a genre now. Its rapid success has caused a proliferation of browser games in which all players are presented with the same puzzle each day, limited guesses, and easy options to share their results.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you&#x27;re attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

                    <span>My eyes unfocused partway through the trailer for Genshin Impact&#x27;s 2.5 update. There was some sort of mystical calamity and it was all very dramatic. Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, &quot;When the Sakura Bloom&quot;, will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

                    <span>Developers offer free weekends with their games all the time, but it feels more like a trap when the game is The Sims 4. Become immersed in EA&#x27;s dollhouse creation kit and what awaits you is a world of costly DLC.

But then heck, I like the game and I&#x27;ve only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

It&#x27;ll be ages before I have time for long bike rides and swims after work again, but it will come. It all comes back around. Until then, what are you playing this weekend?

The prosecution argues that a tough sentence is needed to send a clear message to other criminals. Bowser&#x27;s attorneys disagree and note that their client was used by other group members who, unlike him, probably made millions.

Any delay in the removal of pirated live streams would damage the interests of the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A plus dozens of other leagues, they argue.

Gran Turismo 7 is the first mainline entry in the series since 2013&#x27;s Gran Turismo 6 back on the PlayStation 3. Sure, Gran Turismo Sport was released during the PlayStation 4 generation, but that game left fans wanting more and also equally excited about what was in the pipeline. It turns out, what was in the pipeline was the next full Gran Turismo and after watching a behind-closed-doors preview of it recently, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc came away excited for &quot;the real driving simulator.&quot; 
As someone who&#x27;s never dabbled in the Gran Turismo series beyond a few hours each entry, he was looking for something in GT7 to entice him to stick around. What he found was a couple of new modes and features that seemingly aim to do just that, although we won&#x27;t know until the full release in March. However, if you&#x27;re a hardcore GT fan, don&#x27;t worry – all the bells and whistles you&#x27;ve come to expect in these games are present, looking (and sounding) better than ever. 
In this New Gameplay Today, Wesley is joined by fellow Game Informer editors Ben Reeves and John Carson, all hosted by video editor Alex Stadnik. They talk about new features, returning favorites, being funny on the racetrack, and more. Thanks for watching, and be sure to let us know what you think of this upcoming racing game from PlayStation and Polyphony Digital.</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/04/the-steam-deck-is-big-like-really-really-big">

                    <span>Valve announced the Steam Deck in July of last year and it was met with cautious excitement. Its premise is great – play your Steam games on the go in a Switch-like fashion – but many were confused at the actual layout of the device. Its buttons seem to be running off the edge, the analog sticks are quite high (and not offset like they are on the Switch) and there are two very-large touchpads. 
Oh, and it looked quite big. With excitement continually ramping up for the device, Valve announced last week that the Steam Deck would launch on February 25 (for those who preordered the first wave, of course). That release date is close and it seems some people have already got their hands on the device. They’ve posted some comparison pictures, too, that reveal the Steam Deck is chonky. 
Here’s what it looks like compared to Sony’s PlayStation Vita, a relatively small handheld device:
Vita means life #SteamDeck pic.twitter.com/xitnkv4WqV

And here’s the comparison everyone wants to see – the Nintendo Switch vs. the Steam Deck: 
The Steam Deck is enormous... pic.twitter.com/fMVXckNkiK
February 4, 2022
As you can see in the image above, the Steam Deck is significantly larger than the Switch. For fans of big screens and people with large hands, this is likely an exciting comparison. For people with smaller hands, or for fans of more compact devices, that excitement might be waning. Only time will tell but fortunately, we won’t have to wait too long as the Steam Deck will hit the hands of consumers later this month on February 25.

                    <span>The Nintendo Minute was never a minute, and neither is this week&#x27;s episode of All Things Nintendo! This week, Brian is joined by Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, the two former hosts of Nintendo Minute, Nintendo&#x27;s in-house YouTube show. However, their time at Nintendo extends far beyond simply hosting that show. In fact, when you combine how long Kit and Krysta worked at Nintendo, it&#x27;s almost three decades of experience. On this special episode of All Things Nintendo, Brian chats with the two former Nintendo employees about their long-running show, what it&#x27;s like working at the company, and hints of what could be next for them.

                    <span>Children of Morta is one of the most exceptional hidden gems of the last generation, but the cooperative dungeon crawler has woefully lacked a much-requested feature: online play. Playing with a friend locally has been great, but now you can finally play with remote buddies – or maybe even a sweetheart – this Valentine’s Day. Assuming you’re on PC, that is. 
On February 14, the long-promised online two-player co-op option finally makes its way into the Steam version game. Don’t worry, console players: the feature is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, but developer Dead Mage doesn’t have a timetable on when that will happen. In a press release, the team states it wants to ensure online play functions well on PC before rolling it out elsewhere. 
Online co-op comes via The Fellowship Sanctuary update, the final piece of content of its eight-piece DLC roadmap. That means 11bit will be wrapping up major support for the game which was first released in October 2019 to a 9 out of 10 review score from us here at Game Informer. The dungeon-crawling action game centers on a large family of warriors, all of whom are playable, who must fight back an evil corruption. 
In his review of the game, Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner wrote “I can’t stress just how smartly made Children of Morta is. The narrative flows smoothly in and out of dungeons, the characters have real life to them, and the gameplay is enthralling and has those addictive qualities that make you just want to keep leveling everyone up. In the 15-plus hours I invested in this adventure, I was thoroughly captivated by everything Dead Mage set out to achieve. The way family comes together for the final conflict is truly impressive.”

                    <span>It Takes Two was released by Hazelight last March, published as an EA Originals title. Its director, Josef Fares, is perhaps best known for his dislike of The Academy Awards and you might have seen him on The Game Awards stage last December. That’s because he accepted the Game of the Year award that night. 
Fares is likely still riding the high of that win, but today, news released that’s sure to keep him smiling. Hazelight Studios’ official Twitter account revealed that It Takes Two has sold five million copies.

“5…that’s FIVE million copies of It Takes Two sold,” the tweet reads. “Our team is absolutely stunned just thinking about how many players have now enjoyed our game.” 
5… that’s FIVE million copies of #ItTakesTwo ￼sold! 😳💥🥳
February 4, 2022
Having sold five million copies, It Takes Two is now Hazelight Studios’ most popular game, beating out A Way Out’s 3.5 million copies sold, as reported by GameSpot. 
It Takes Two being this successful isn’t much of a surprise – the game’s great! Game Informer gave it a 9.25 out of 10 and you can read that review here. Hazelight Studios seems set on capitalizing on the game’s success, too, as it recently announced a film and television adaptation is in the works.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, and Andrew Reiner on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Rockstar’s blog post today concluded with a note stating as much, which you can read in full below:
So there you have it. While not the biggest surprise in the world, there is a vocal sect of fans that will be relieved to know that, yes, Rockstar won’t be re-releasing GTA V in perpetuity. The question becomes how long it will be before Grand Theft Auto 6, or whatever Rockstar decides to call it, makes its grand debut.

The move to more powerful hardware means some new bells and whistles for the best-selling games. GTA V and Online now boast resolutions up to 4K, HDR and ray tracing, improved textures and draw distances, and up to 60 frames per second gameplay. The PS5 version also features 3D audio and DualSense haptic feedback. Here&#x27;s a visual example of what to expect in this trailer from last year&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase.

Today marks the third anniversary of Apex Legends. It seems like only yesterday Respawn surprise-launched its secret battle royale, and I was entering my second week as a Game Informer intern.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is finally out and it seems the latest zombie parkour game from Techland is doing really well. 
If Steam numbers are anything to go off of, Dying Light 2 is easily Techland’s most successful game. In fact, its all-time peak is nearly four times larger than Dying Light’s all-time peak. Mind you, Dying Light has been out since 2015 and Dying Light 2 has been out for essentially 24 hours. That it’s already surpassed the original game with such massive numbers is quite the feat, as noted by games analyst Benji-Sales on Twitter.

More specifically, Dying Light 2’s all-time peak at the moment is 177,222 players, according to Steam Charts. Dying Light’s all-time peak is 45,876. In fact, Dying Light 2 has already surpassed last year’s big horror release, Resident Evil Village, which has an all-time peak of 106,631. 
Now, it’s important to note that PC player counts don’t necessarily translate to console player counts, but there’s a good chance that if PC player counts are this high, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One concurrents are just as high, if not higher. If that’s the case, then Techland absolutely has another hit on their hands. 
That wouldn’t be surprising either because Dying Light 2 is a great game – Game Informer gave it a 9.5 out of 10. Not to mention, Techland has already publicly discussed its commitment to this game, releasing a five-year roadmap for planned DLC. The sequel could get another boost in player counts too when the Switch version of Dying Light 2, which was recently delayed, is finally released.

                    <span>Surprising nobody, Pokémon Legends: Arceus has sold a massive 6.5 million copies and it did so within just seven days of its January 28 release date. 
These sales numbers came the same day Nintendo released its quarterly results where the company revealed that the Switch has crossed 103 million units sold, surpassing the Wii’s lifetime sales. Nintendo also revealed in those results that it isn’t changing its investment plans in light of recent acquisitions (looking at you Microsoft and Sony) and that the hybrid home console is only in the middle of its lifecycle.

Oddly enough, despite releasing sales numbers for games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and even Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Nintendo didn’t mention Game Freak’s latest release, Poké…</span>

They&#x27;re sustained by fans&#x27; hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She&#x27;s a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she&#x27;s not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she&#x27;s running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she&#x27;s doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

                    <span>Eight years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games have finally confirmed yes, they really are making a new GTA. For eight years they&#x27;ve focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they&#x27;ll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

This week it&#x27;s the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that&#x27;s making things difficult. You&#x27;re the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It&#x27;s sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I&#x27;m a little bit annoyed that I like it.

                    <span>Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it&#x27;s also unashamedly strange.

Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

                    <span>Square Enix today announced a follow-up to Voice Of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, the 2021 card-based JRPG by a team with Drakengard and Nier veterans including that infamous masked developer, Yoko Taro. Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is the new one&#x27;s name and surprise, launching later this month is its game—less than five months after the first.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is out and hoo boy, is it a tough nut to crack. Not in the hours to completion sense, or even difficulty in general – Matthew’s review found a rather unthreatening strain of undead – but in how tricky it is to get running smoothly on PC. That goes double if you want to dolly up this post-apocalypse with some shiny ray tracing features, so even if you’ve got a rig that can breeze through most games, I’d recommend reading on for a guide to Dying Light 2’s best settings.

                    <span>There is a very high chance that Mike Booth&#x27;s fingerprints are on one of your favourite games. He&#x27;s one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic RPG Nox? That&#x27;s Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he&#x27;s currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Demeo won a lot of &quot;best of&quot; accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it&#x27;s coming to regular ol&#x27; PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

                    <span>When you become a game designer, you are handed a big book of antagonists to use as guilt-free bullet fodder. First among them is the reliable, stinky zombie. (Also found in this repertoire are Nazis and Slimes. They are beyond the scope of this listicle.) The zombie is a preternaturally killable being. It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what&#x27;s coming. Being a zombie is like having two degrees. You&#x27;re extra qualified, and you probably groan a lot.
Here&#x27;s a list of the best zombies in PC games.

                    <span>The 25th Annual DICE Awards are taking place later this month, and the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences has announced head of Xbox, Phil Spencer will receive the prestigious AIAS Lifetime Achievement Award.
Presenting the award to Spencer will be industry luminary, and fellow Microsoft alumn Todd Howard, who was welcomed into the company through the acquisition of Bethesda Game Studios and its parent company ZeniMax Media, led by Spencer in 2019. In the announcement of the award recipient, the AIAS gave a summary of Phil&#x27;s history in the game industry including the new role of Microsoft Gaming CEO and the many studios he&#x27;s brought into the Xbox family. 
The list of accomplishments is long, and many have only come about in the last few years. The AIAS describes the Lifetime Achievement Award as &quot;reserved for individuals whose accomplishments span a broad range of disciplines over a lengthy career in the industry,&quot; and individuals do not necessarily need to be hands-on with development. It&#x27;s safe to say Phil Spencer has been a very influential force in the direction Xbox is heading this generation with its focus on powerful console hardware, flexible ecosystems that span the Xbox, PC, Mobile, and elsewhere, and popular services like Xbox Game Pass.
Meggan Scavio, President of the AIAS, was quoted saying, “Phil Spencer has demonstrated both passion and leadership throughout his entire career at Microsoft. He’s responsible for countless impactful and pivotal initiatives that have reverberated throughout the entire gaming industry.&quot; The award has been previously presented to Minoru Arakawa, Howard Lincoln, Ken Kutaragi, Doug Lowenstein, Bing Gordon, Satoru Iwata, and Genyo Takeda.
The 25th Annual DICE Awards will be held on February 24 at 8 p.m. Pacific at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.</span>

                    <span>Since its surprise launch last month, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel has taken the world by storm. The free-to-play title based on the popular children’s card game trading card game has rocketed towards the top of Steam charts and Twitch streams, though a mobile release was the last big missing piece of its (millennium) puzzle. Switch has been the only option for playing on the go, but that changes today with the game’s launch on iOS and Android.
Although Master Duel became available on mobile a week ago in other countries, today marks its debut in North American territories. That means you can get Ash Blossom’d and stare down Eldlich the Golden Lord anywhere an internet connection allows. If you’re new to Master Duel, it’s basically a premium version of the traditional trading card game. Unlike Duel Links, Master Duel uses Master Rule 5 AKA the standard ruleset of the real-life game. Master Duel also supports cross-play and cross-progression, with Season 2 of ranked duels kicking off earlier this week. 
Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duels is also available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. For more on the game, check out this opinion piece on how playing its ranked matches can be a good way of learning to put yourself out there.</span>

                    <span>Today, Tango Gameworks provided the first extended look at Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s moment-to-moment gameplay and the other activities players can get into throughout its haunted Tokyo. A pair of videos provides a walkthrough of the game&#x27;s action, while a developer interview reveals the team&#x27;s design process. 
We already knew that the game’s story is set after Tokyo’s population disappears thanks to the arrival of dangerous Yokai, or spirits. You play as a lone survivor, Akito, who awakens possessed by a spirit named KK who imbues you with elemental powers. This power is called Ethereal Weaving, and let you channel the elements of fire, wind, and water. Executing these moves resembles a blend of Doctor Strange’s spellcasting and Avatar: The Last Airbender’s bending thanks to its flashy, elaborate hand gestures. Physical weapons complement your spells such as a bow and various talismans, and you can stealth attack enemies instead of blasting them head-on.  
Among other features, the first video shows off Akito tango ability, which lets him fire a spirit tether to grapple and ascend buildings. We also got a look at corrupted, fog-covered areas players must clear out and surreal shape-shifting areas that evoke the psychological horror of Tango Gamework’s previous series, The Evil Within.

                    <span>The city that never sleeps is as dangerous as it&#x27;s ever been, but Harlem&#x27;s friendly-neighborhood Spider-Man does it all, from saving helpless bodega cats to dismantling nuclear time bombs. And like any modern-day celebrity, Spider-Man always makes time to respond to Twitter followers or take goofy selfies with adoring fans. Yes, the new web-slinger is as dependable and personable as they come, but I know his greatest secrets. Miles Morales, the young man behind the mask, loves playing video games, producing groovy hip-hop beats, and conducting elaborate science experiments. He agonizes over his hair in the bathroom mirror and has a weak spot for dulce de coco. But, more importantly, he looks like me.

While previous worlds have been immersive and captivating to explore, Elden Ring represents a grandiose shift.
From Software brings everything it’s achieved in the last decade of releases into this singular, massive entity that brings the best bits of its previous creations into a vibrant open world. As always, From Software’s honed duality of challenge and triumph go hand in hand, and players will find themselves continually tested against brutal opponents and unforgiving environments.

                    <span>Anyone paying attention to the video game landscape over the past month might feel like companies are in an ongoing war to buy up independent studios that make great products. 
The acquisition ball has pretty much always been rolling – it’s part of a companies growth – but Microsoft’s $7.5 billion acquisition of Bethesda really upped the ante. Then, earlier last month, Take-Two Interactive purchased Zynga, the company behind FarmVille and Words With Friends, for a massive $12.7 billion.

                    <span>The Switch is now the third best-selling console from Nintendo after surpassing 103 million units sold. 
More specifically, in Nintendo’s latest round of quarterly results, the company revealed that 103.54 million Switch consoles have been sold. That means it has officially surpassed the Wii, which sold 101.63 million in its lifetime. Before these results, the Switch was at 92 million units sold and behind the Wii, Game Boy (118.69 million), and the DS (154.02 million).

Nintendo’s president also revealed that the Switch is only in the middle of its lifecycle, suggesting it might be on its way to passing the Game Boy at least. The DS’ massive 154 million seems like more of a stretch but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible.

Yesterday, both EA and Sony released their quarterly financial results so it’s no surprise Nintendo’s arrived today. What is a surprise, though, for some is that we might still be another five years away from a new Nintendo console.

“Switch is just in the middle of its lifecycle and the momentum going into this year is good,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said during the results, as reported by Bloomberg. “The Switch is ready to break a pattern of our past consoles that saw momentum weakening in their sixth year on the market and grow…</span>

Let me introduce you properly to Risona, Asari Commander. She’s a legendary Human Samurai creature in the Boros/Lorehold colors that costs 1RW to cast. Bringing a solid three power and three toughness and Haste to the board, Risona is bringing a decent body for her cost, ready to rush in for an attack.

The studio recently released some images and gifs of Horizon Forbidden West running on a PlayStation 4 Pro and a neat “meet the cast” trailer. Today, it released new footage about the challenges within the expansive game world.

Aloy’s friend Petra says it’s essential for Aloy to check out every shop in the settlements she visits to ensure she has the best armor, weapons, and upgrades possible. She then suggests that Aloy visit the Melee Pits to learn new spear mechanics and hone her skills. 
After checking out the Melee Pits, Aloy can give the Hunting Grounds a go, where she’ll have to take down specific machines and more. If that’s not enough, Aloy can pick up Salvage Contracts to earn some extra currency. Of course, returning challenges include ruins, cauldrons, machine arenas, and more. 
The trailer even seems to imply machine races in Horizon Forbidden West. We’ll all learn more about these challenges when Horizon Forbidden West hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18. 
While waiting for its release, read about these eight promising improvements coming to Horizon Forbidden West and then read about how Guerrilla Games is taking Aloy to new places in this sequel. Check out this breakdown of everything we know about Horizon Forbidden West after that.

More specifically, you can now unlock The Foundation in Fortnite through its Chapter 3 Season 1 battle pass. If you’re unfamiliar with The Foundation, he’s one of the ongoing protagonists in Fortnite’s overarching narrative. He was last seen breaking Jonesy free from Dr. Slone’s grasp at the end of Season 2 and while a massive statue of The Foundation stands on the island, he’s been more of a lowkey character since.

Last week, I noticed my hand was sore. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, mostly because I wasn&#x27;t sure why it would be hurting. On Monday, while playing OlliOlli World, I found my reason. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a better way to recommend World than that; it pushed my hands to their limit. 
Compared to the previous two OlliOlli games, which could be prohibitively difficult, World is simultaneously an easy-to-approach 2D skateboarding game with an impossibly high skill ceiling. Early on, the game does a great job quickly teaching you the basics of its trick systems (mostly tied…</span>

Long has the internet wondered what developer Yacht Club Games would do to follow up the success of the indie darling Shovel Knight. We now know the answer is Mina the Hollower, a gorgeous homage to Zelda and Game Boy titles of old, and we&#x27;re going hands-on with the title on today&#x27;s edition of New Gameplay Today!
Join John Carson and Alex Stadnik as they fill you in on everything you need to know about Mina. We detail the non-spoiler parts of the story and dive into who our new mouse protagonist is and why she&#x27;s collecting as many bones as she can in the process.
We also take a look at the game&#x27;s new mechanics. Don&#x27;t worry Shovel Knight fans. There is still plenty of digging to be had as Mina burrows her way through this gorgeous pixel art world. She&#x27;ll also be using Castlevania-inspired weapons such as a whip and throwing axes to slay her bone-clenching foes. She&#x27;ll need every last weapon she can get her hands on, too, as Yacht Club also is upping the difficulty. Whether it&#x27;s the aforementioned dastardly foes or the perilous puzzles, players will assuredly have their hands full when Mina the Hollower drops in late 2023.

After years of building out the world and characters of Shovel Knight through expansions and side adventures, developer Yacht Club Games is finally ready to create something unrelated to the dirt-digging hero. The studio is taking to Kickstarter once again to fund its newest project Mina the Hollower, which features a mousey protagonist with a familiar penchant for moving soil. I’ve spent quite a bit of time hands-on with the game’s demo, and while it’s a very early vertical slice, my first adventure with Mina offered a difficult yet promising look into what the final game may have in store.
Like Shovel Knight’s 8-bit homages to games like Mega Man, Yacht Club wears its inspirations proudly on its sleeve. With a top-down camera…</span>

                    <span>I become more interested in supernatural, open world, first-person magic &#x27;em up Ghostwire: Tokyo with every new thing I see of it. Today, Tango Gameworks broadcast a 20 minute-long showcase and developer interview that had enough stealth, grapple hooks, and paranormal finger-guns to convince me completely. You can watch the full thing below.

The class-based looter-shooter is getting its first paid DLC, Survivors Of The Void, which adds two new classes - including the Railgunner. You can watch a trailer for the expansion below in preparation of its release on March 1st.

It&#x27;s the latest game to be given away for free on the Epic Games Store.

                    <span>I have played Vampire Survivors twice - that’s two (2) times - in total. In only that short space of time, the arcade-style game has sunk its teeth into me. You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

                    <span>Writing, I can tell you as a professional, is the most important yet difficult thing anyone has ever done in the world. I am therefore extremely grateful for Narrative Device, a browser-based AI doodad which generates the opening paragraph of a story based on two themes or things you feed into it. Finally, some help for the writers of the world! It&#x27;s potentially interesting and useful, or at the very least it is fun to make a computer say silly things.

                    <span>This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is going all in on our favourite finishing moves. This doesn&#x27;t just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term &#x27;the GG push&#x27;. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew&#x27;s celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

                    <span>So good it will give you blisters. It&#x27;s a sentence you might read in a glossy 1990s PlayStation magazine ad. &quot;So good it will give you blisters,&quot; it says of the latest polygonal bloodsport, with a wired controller hanging from a ceiling, covered in gore. The hyperbole of a generation, a distortion of edgy marketing either aped or mocked by today&#x27;s advertising sophisticates. You get blisters from walking up hills, not video games. In the forensically sucky cyberpresent of 2022, there is no place for such exaggeration.
OlliOlli World is so good it will give you blisters. I know because I got one.

Still, the makers are quite insistent, so let&#x27;s humour their charade and hear what they have to say about their future plans for the base-building Norse mythology survival game. Steam Deck support, caves in the Mountains biome, a pretty moth in the Mistlands... okay, sure.

More than a decade has passed since but the issue could now make a comeback in a piracy liability lawsuit. Internet provider RCN plans to use it as a defense, while the labels claim that the DRM issue is old and irrelevant.

Not only does it showcase some of the bleeding-edge graphics the Gran Turismo series is known for, but it reveals that GT7 is much more than just a racing game. 
Of course, it is absolutely still a racing game first and foremost but if competitive racing isn&#x27;t your jam, GT7 seems jam-packed with other things for you to do and enjoy.
&quot;Over its 25-year history, the Gran Turismo series has demonstrated a serious love and respect for cars,&quot; GT7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi said at the top of the showcase. &quot;What&#x27;s more, Gran Turismo 7 represents the 25th anniversary of the series.

                    <span>Gran Turismo Sport was released in 2017, and although some aspects earned praise, it left fans wanting more while also exciting them about what’s to come in the next game. The DNA of Sport, which was mostly focused on competitive multiplayer, seems to be present in GT7, but after previewing the game, it’s clear that this sequel offers so much more. 
And that’s exciting for someone like me who has never really made it beyond a few hours into a Gran Turismo game. I went into this preview looking for reasons to be excited for Polyphony Digital’s latest love letter to cars and came away with enough to feel like GT7 is worth checking out.

Sony is hosting a special PlayStation 5 showcase for the upcoming title, and the festivities begin at 5:00 p.m. Eastern. 
Additionally, the YouTube video’s description reveals Ghostwire: Tokyo’s release date of March 25. It also reveals pre-order bonuses and a Deluxe Edition, which grants early access to the game three days early (for digital purchases only). The following bonus items are Shinobi Outfit, Kunai Weapon, and Streetwear Fashion Pack. We’ll likely get a look at these goodies and more during the broadcast, which you can bookmark below ahead of time.

In addition to releasing on PlayStation 5 as a timed exclusive, Ghostwire: Tokyo is also launching on PC. The first-person action title puts you in the shoes of Akito, one of the few remaining humans in Tokyo after the population vanishes and paranormal entities take over. Akito joins forces with a spirit named KK, granting him otherworldly abilities of his own to take down these spirits. Ghostwire: Tokyo was first unveiled during Bethesda’s 2019 E3 showcase and was initially slated to release in 2021 before being delayed. 
We’re excited to get a new look at the game tomorrow and pleased that its release isn’t that far off. In the meantime, be sure to check out our career profile on Ghostwire: Tokyo’s bubbly former creative director Ikumi Nakamura.</span>

The company released its quarterly results today and it revealed that 17.3 million PS5s have been shipped so far, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz. At this same point in its lifetime, the PS4 had shipped 20.2 million units, representing a lag in shipped numbers for the PS5. However, the PS4 had virtually no supply issues at this point in its life cycle whereas getting a PS5 is still extremely difficult.

                    <span>Sony released its quarterly financial results yesterday and in it, CFO Hiroki Totoki revealed that PlayStation plans to launch 10 live service games by March 2026. 
This isn’t surprising, considering the company essentially just invested $3.6 billion in developing live service games by acquiring Bungie earlier this week. However, 10 games is a lot. Ten live service games in four years is very ambitious, but it seems Sony and PlayStation are going to rely on Bungie’s expertise in the genre a lot, not to mention, Bungie has its own original IP in the works too.
“The strategic significance of this acquisition lies not only in obtaining the highly successful Destiny franchise, as well as major new IP Bungie is currently developing, but also incorporating into the Sony group the expertise and technologies Bungie has developed in the live game services space,” Totoki said, as reported by The Verge. “Through close collaboration between Bungie and PlayStation Studios we aim to launch more than 10 live service games by the fiscal year ending March 2026.” 
With all this talk of live service and multiplayer games in light of Sony acquiring Bungie, you might be wondering if PlayStation is shifting away from its focus on single-player, story-driven games. Considering Sony’s first-party studios known for those kinds of games are still around, you’ll likely still be seeing single-player games from PlayStation. With the acquisition of Bungie, it just seems that Sony is using some of its newer studios and expertise to get studios pumping out new live service games. 
In the meantime, catch up on Sony’s acquisition of Bungie and then check out Game Informer’s reactions to that news. Read Game Informer’s Destiny 2: The Witch Queen preview after that.

                    <span>343 Industries revealed last year, before the launch of Halo Infinite, that the game would not ship with campaign co-op or a Forge mode. Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten said around that time that an update regarding these two modes, and a seasonal roadmap for the shooter, would arrive in January, but that didn’t happen. 
Staten has now revealed that the planned Halo Infinite update on the game’s seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge has been delayed. The reason why is so that the team can have more time to share concrete plans.

“Hey folks,” Staten said in a tweet. “In November, I said we’d have a Halo Infinite update on our seasonal roadmap, co-op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we’ll have an update as soon as we can.” 



Hey folks. In November, I said we&#x27;d have a #HaloInfinite update on our Seasonal roadmap, Co-Op, and Forge in January. We need more time to finalize our plans so what we share is something you can rely on. This work is my top priority, and we&#x27;ll have an update as soon as we can.
February 1, 2022
As for when to expect this update, that’s anybody’s guess as Staten did not further elaborate. Fans noticed this update hadn’t happened when the calendar jumped from January to February but Staten let everyone know that a delay had happened on February 1. Here’s hoping the update comes soon because we can’t wait to jump back into Halo Infinite’s campaign with a co-op partner. 
If you’re waiting for that too, read Game Informer’s Halo Infinite review in the meantime and then read about how Halo Infinite was the series’ biggest launch ever. Check out the changes to the economy of Halo Infinite’s multiplayer store after that.

                    <span>After years and years of waiting, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is almost out and in the hands of players. In fact, it’s already in the hands of some players who have received early retail copies of the zombie parkour sequel. 
If you’re one of those people, Techland really wants you to resist the urge and wait until the game’s proper release on February 4 to play the game. That’s because there’s a Day One patch that will make the experience better.

“Fellow survivors, we see that some of you got access to the retail copies of Dying Light 2 before the release date (it’s this Friday, only 3 days left!),” a tweet from the official Dying Light account reads. “We understand you want to start exploring the city ASAP and we couldn’t be happier. That being said, we …</span>

From its increased thickness to the gold shine on the cover, this is as high-end as magazines get.
This month, the copy of Game Informer Gold that is up for grabs is our Elden Ring issue.

                    <span>As the consolidation of the games industry continues, Sony buying Bungie is the acquisition that might most directly affect me, someone who has played over 2000 hours of Destiny 2. Bungie have said things will continue as normal on all platforms. But beyond the usual issues with consolidation and platformholders buying studios, the concerns I have for Destiny 2&#x27;s future stem from the same old source: Bungie&#x27;s own decisions. The grind needs to end.

                    <span>Western Digital are continuing their charge into high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSDs with the WD Black SN770. This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

One thing that might help get you in a Soulsborne headspace is Bloodborne PSX, a free PlayStation 1-esque demake of FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG.

                    <span>One of the most popular Internet monsters, a grotesque neck-snapping concrete figure codenamed SCP-173, is losing its face. SCP-173 is part of the SCP Foundation, a collaborative online horror writing project which most famously inspired Remedy&#x27;s Control, and has appeared in several SCP fan games, too. But as SCP&#x27;s administrators wrestle with copyright and morality issues, they&#x27;re preparing to remove that iconic image, which actually is a photo of a sculpture by a Japanese artist.

                    <span>No, Dying Light 2 doesn’t take 500 hours to complete. Call it closer to 30 and change, although my map still swarms with chores and requests to deal with post-campaign. Plenty of words have been written about Techland’s backfiring boast of a three week runtime, so no need to relitigate that here. Going in, the only time value I was interested in was how long - if ever - the game takes to sink its teeth into you.

                    <span>The creators of retro platformer Shovel Knight have announced a whole new adventure, drawing inspiration from different classics this time. Mina The Hollower is its name, and retro action-adventure with Zelda and Castlevania influences is its game. Like with Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games are partially crowdfunding Mina through a Kickstarter campaign, and in less than a day they&#x27;ve already passed the goal. Have a peek in the trailer.

                    <span>Capcom released an &#x27;HD&#x27; remaster of Resident Evil 4 in 2014, but their official makeover is nothing compared to the work by a small team of modders across almost eight years. Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it&#x27;s the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game&#x27;s textures and models with high-def versions, they&#x27;ve tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

                    <span>Víme, že funkcionalita umožňující dodatečnou softwarovou aktivaci vlastností CPU Intel, když si je uživatel doplatí, je v přípravě. Samotný Intel zatím plně plány neohlásil, ale z patchů, které míří do Linuxu, je zjevné, že podpora Software Defined Silicon (SDSi) bude jednoho nepříliš vzdáleného dne součástí Linuxu.</span>

                    <span>Later this month, a 52-year old British man will be sentenced by a New York federal court for his role in the SPARKS piracy Scene group. Mr. Bridi, who was extradited to the US from Cyprus previously pleaded guilty. While the defense argues that a reduced sentence is warranted, the U.S. Government is asking the court to award a significant 27 to 33-month term to deter other pirates.

It&#x27;s Gibbon&#x27;s Pro Skater. GibbonGibbon World. It&#x27;s from the creators of Old Man&#x27;s Journey and looks similarly gorgeous, and it&#x27;s due out in early 2022.

Every time they announce the next port in development, the howls of Bloodborne fans can be heard across the internet. When will From Software&#x27;s gothic slasher make the move to our superior home computers?

I&#x27;ve no answer for you, but fan-made demake Bloodborne PSX should tide you over for a little while. It&#x27;s Bloodborne as if made for 32-bit consoles, four hours long, and features the original game&#x27;s first two bosses. It&#x27;s out now.

Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I&#x27;m not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. &quot;Look how much emotion their faces show now!&quot; was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

                    <span>Hi, nice to meet you. Can I get you anything? A drink, a bite to eat, an acquisition maybe? There are apparently a lot of them to go around, after all. Hear that? It&#x27;s Sony buying Bungie. It&#x27;s Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It&#x27;s Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth&#x27;s crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

I don’t think any other SSD manufacturer so consistently goes quiet for months on end, then suddenly rocks up at your house, slams a world-beating NVMe drive on your desk and wordlessly disappears again. It happened with the A2000, it happened with the KC2500 and now it’s happened with the Fury Renegade.

For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

                    <span>Popular TV-torrent distribution group ETTV has vanished. The official site has been offline for more than a week and many bots already stopped uploading content to third-party sites weeks ago. ETTV has recovered from internal troubles in the past but, without a word from the admin, a comeback is not expected anytime soon.

                    <span>Four major manga publishers are preparing to sue US-based CDN company Cloudflare for allowing pirate sites to use its services. Rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States, Shueisha, Kodansha, Shogakukan, and Kadokawa will file their complaint in Japan, demanding millions in damages and an end to the distribution of pirated content.

                    <span>The wag behind videos editing Austin Powers into Mass Effect and Mr Bean into Cyberpunk 2077 has returned to the shagadelic font. Just as Shepherd was reborn for Mass Effect 2, Powers rises again in the new video retelling BioWare&#x27;s sci-fi RPG sequel with England&#x27;s greatest secret agent. It remains funny and silly and an unexpectedly good fit.

                    <span>Just when you thought all the big movers and shakers had done their multi-billion dollar acquisition deals for the year, Sony have just announced they&#x27;re buying Bungie for $3.6 billion. A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will &quot;remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher.&quot; Well!

                    <span>Following Code Force&#x27;s recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I&#x27;ve been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I&#x27;m struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it&#x27;s had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I&#x27;m hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

                    <span>A new standalone singleplayer game of Gwent is coming this year, telling a new tale with the card game spun off from The Witcher 3. It&#x27;s codenamed Project Golden Nekker and... that&#x27;s about all we know for know. It&#x27;s not another &#x27;Witcher Tales&#x27; like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

                    <span>Even with a bunch of post-launch performance improvements, Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the kind of game that can make most PCs sweat. Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

                    <span>Square Enix first launched Final Fantasy VII 25 years ago today, introducing a new generation to big-sword bishies. In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don&#x27;t know about are coming. Hopefully this means we&#x27;ll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

                    <span>It wouldn’t work without the sounds. The thwop of your whip, the thwick of your dagger. The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

                    <span>Intel’s Arc graphics cards are, despite apparent delays, likely to launch this year. And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

                    <span>Me, in 2000: ah, so shaders can make textures in Quake 3 look glowy or wibbly. Me, in 2016: oh, okay, so shaders can also be used to create shoals of fish in Abzu. Me, right now: wait, so shaders can also be used to tell the story of a planet over four and a half billions years, from a lump of molten rock to the formation of mountains, rivers, and human cities. 
Humanity, an in-browser shader created by David A. Roberts, is worth the four minutes it takes to watch.

                    <span>Halo Infinite has been having trouble with its Big Team Battle mode since launch. Attempts to fix it before Christmas and earlier in January largely failed, with the mode available but matchmaking issues making it near-impossible to play for some. 

Now 343 Industries think they&#x27;ve fixed the issue, with a patch due to be deployed sometime after February 3rd.

                    <span>Microsoft are making their auto-renewing subscriptions more flexible under pressure from the CMA, the UK&#x27;s Competition And Markets Authority. The regulator&#x27;s investigation began in 2019 and ended this past week, with the CMA saying they had &quot;secured undertakings&quot; that impact Xbox Live and Xbox Game Pass. The changes include Microsoft refunding and even cancelling subscriptions in cases where customers &quot;haven&#x27;t used their memberships for a long time.&quot;

                    <span>If you repeatedly download and share pirated content you risk losing your Internet access in the United States. Faced with liability lawsuits, ISPs are more inclined to take this drastic action today, which can have grave consequences. For one subscriber, downloading a Skyrim mod appears to have been too much. But is this really what the game&#x27;s creators want?

                    <span>This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I&#x27;ll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

The games I&#x27;ve collected this week for the first TFI Friday of the year are going to ease us gently out of the time loop that we&#x27;ve been stuck in the last umpteen months. Accordingly, the first one is a time loop puzzle game.

                    <span>Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I&#x27;m currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn&#x27;t be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call &#x27;cute&#x27; NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer &quot;BOY!&quot; Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War&#x27;s other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he&#x27;s doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot; nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

                    <span>In theory, I miss auto scrolling arcade shooters and would love it if they came back. In reality, they come back all the time and I never really click with them because what I really miss is being a child and feeling like almost every game I saw was magical.
I&#x27;m pretty bad at them as well, which doesn&#x27;t help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.

It&#x27;s a statement I have only briefly put to the test during a rushed weeked in San Antonio, a trip I mostly remember for 1) seeing a roadside billboard that advertised Jesus on one side and massive tits on the other, and 2) making a joke about having a puffy taco &quot;so I guess I should see a doctor!&quot; [finger guns] that fell bone-chillingly flat to a dinner table of American business colleagues.
You know where everything actually is bigger? The past. Join us on this special supporter-funded bonus podcast episode where Nate is our gentle and enthusiastic guide for really massive historical monsters. A giant owl? Bigfoot is really an orangutan? A huge fish that might in fact just be well big, owing to a mistake with its skeleton? Yes, we have all these delights and more. A big thank you to our supporters for making The Nate Files happen.

                    <span>With NFTs in games proving unpopular with almost everyone who doesn&#x27;t plan to get rich by fleecing other players, even appearing to support them is controversial. This is a situation Riot Games found themselves in after a lighthearted tweet about one of the Valorant wizards visiting an art exhibition on a day out. Turns out, the picture seen by Killjoy is an NFT. Cue Riot scrambling to make clear it was unintentional and say, literally, &quot;Whoopsie!&quot;

                    <span>Anecdotally, the first records of modern golf date back to its banning in 15th century Scotland. “Nay Golf,” said parliament. “It’s turning the soldiers into fiendish, turf-snorting club-strokers who’d rather say shit like ‘Triple Bogey’ than batter the English, and we’re no having it.” RPGolf Legends is not set in 15th century Scotland, but it does take place in a world where golf has been banned. Only you - through the power of bare-bones ARPG combat and a fun but limited golf mini-game - can save the noble sport from ostensible nonexistence. 
I say ostensible because, in reality, golf is everywhere. Our heroine Aerin’s hometown is called Mulligandale. It has two shops, one of them dedicated entirely to golf. Folk shimmy about in golfwear, talking about golf. Many give out golf-related quests, the rewards for which are usually some form of golfing paraphernalia, often golf balls. The actual golf courses themselves have been sealed off by an ill-defined big villainous, but if you put a translucent barrier around the thing you’re trying to crush and still let the people you’re attempting to terrorise build their entire society as a monument to it, you’re basically asking for a plucky hero to restore the national passtime to glory. Highly questionable bit of villainy, this.

                    <span>Welcome to The RPS Time Capsule, a new monthly feature we&#x27;re putting together where every member of the RPS editorial team picks their favourite, bestest best game from a specific year and tells us why that game above all else deserves to be preserved in our freshly minted time pod. It might be that it&#x27;s the best example of its genre, or it contains a valuable lesson for future generations. This month, we&#x27;re travelling back to rescue eight games from 2010, and cor, what a good year that was. Too bad almost all of them will end up in the lava bin by the time we&#x27;re done.

It&#x27;ll be gone after February 3rd, at which point it&#x27;ll be replaced by Epic&#x27;s next free game, Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair.

                    <span>Hyper Scape was launched suddenly in July 2020. Initially accessible only via Twitch drops, early streams gathered half a million viewers before it opened up to everyone ten days later.

Unfortunately its drop in popularity was just as sudden, and almost as immediate. Eighteen months later, Ubisoft have announced they&#x27;re ending development and shutting the game down on April 28th.

I&#x27;m often not interested in games which reflect my daily life but Submerged: Hidden Depths makes it look so pretty to lark about in water and explore the ruins of civilisation that sure, I&#x27;ll do it in the game too. Check out the trailer below.

Grappling hooks are the best thing in video games, and I am fully ready to swing through a colourful, cute platformer. To my infinite delight, Grapple Dog now has a release date: February 10th.

But, now they say they&#x27;ll offer a £9/$10 upgrade from the base game, and announced a release date of the 30th of March. Right-o!

                    <span>Back in the mists of time of 2013, a bunch of Japanese developers got together to make a series of short 3DS games called the Guild series. Headed up by Ni No Kuni makers Level-5, it had some pretty big-name contributors: Keiji Inafune, Goichi Suda, Yoot Saito and Yasumi Matsuno among others. But there was one game that stood out to me as something really quite special. It was the considerably less well-known Millennium Kitchen&#x27;s Attack Of The Friday Monsters, a sweet slice of life adventure that saw you play as ten-year-old Sohta walking the streets of his small Tokyo suburb on a hazy summer afternoon in 1971. It was a tender celebration of childhood nostalgia and imagination, with just an inkling of some menacing undertones, both from the people Sohta meets in his neighbourhood and the titular Friday kaiju monsters that may or may not exist in the real world. 
I mention all this because The Kids We Were is probably the only game I&#x27;ve played since then that&#x27;s even come close to capturing some of that Attack Of The Friday Monsters magic. You won&#x27;t find any kaiju here, but this is a similarly nostalgic portrait of pastoral Tokyo, as viewed through the eyes of young Minato on his summer holidays, first in the present day and then in the 1980s when he ends up travelling back in time Back To The Future-style to when his parents first met as kids. With three days to right past wrongs, this is one of those gentle, coming of age tales that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy in all the right places, even when there&#x27;s no real &#x27;game&#x27; to speak of.

                    <span>Hitman 3 had a rough launch on Steam last week, quickly gathering 50% negative user reviews. Many of the complaints related to price and confusion over the various editions on sale.
To make amends, Io Interactive are giving anyone who buys Hitman 3 on Steam before February 19th a free upgrade. If you buy the standard edition (£50/$60), you&#x27;ll be bumped up to the Deluxe Edition (£75/$90). If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you&#x27;ll get a free upgrade to the Seven Deadly Sins Collection (which on its own costs £23.73 with its 15% launch discount).

Maybe if we turn away and pretend they&#x27;re not there, it&#x27;ll all burn out when scammers grow tired of being scammed by other scammers. However, one of the few people I do want to hear talk about it all is Yanis Varoufakis, who was Valve&#x27;s in-house economist before becoming Greece&#x27;s finance minister then an MP. In a wonderfully long new interview, he is not impressed by much of the hype, and it is DELIGHTFUL.

                    <span>Mercifully, voice comms in PC games aren’t all about being lambasted by strangers. Whether giving a quick thanks to a helpful teammate or settling into an hours-long Discord session, some games are just better with a bit of a chinwag going on – and adding one of the best gaming microphones to your setup will make sure you always come through loud and clear.

                    <span>Be honest with me: when you read the words &quot;Lovecraftian dating sim&quot;, did your mind go straight to a joke about tentacle porn? Horror-themed dating sims are not exactly new, but it&#x27;s rare to be given the opportunity to date the eldritch gods themselves, and taken at face value, it&#x27;s hard to imagine where else this could be going.
Well, allow me to dispel your illusions right away: Sucker For Love: First Date is not an H-game. It is, in fact, the most chaste dating sim I think I&#x27;ve ever played, while also managing to be the most obscenely graphic. You often hear games that straddle different genres accused of not knowing what they&#x27;re trying to be. Sucker For Love does not suffer from this issue: it knows exactly what it wants to be. The challenge is for you, the hapless player, to keep the hell up.

                    <span>Until recently, Mad Maggie&#x27;s main claim to fame in Apex Legends was that she had a surprisingly spry 80-year-old mum, and loved to tell people about it. Now we know she&#x27;ll be emerging from the backstory and joining the playable Legend roster with Season 12 (Defiance), and a new trailer gives us our first look at her rather destructive set of abilities.

                    <span>This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast discusses some of our favourite (and least favourite) inventory configurations. A humble beast, the inventory, yet a feature of many games - sometimes even a necessity. Often we only notice one if it&#x27;s terrible. But boy, a good inventory is worth a dozen mules. So lets talk about them today!
In other news this week, Nate thinks he has come up with an original premise for a Pixar film, only to discover he has invented Seth Rogan&#x27;s nightmare film Sausage Party, and we are officially starting our campaign to get Henry &#x27;Vitamin H&#x27; Cavill on the show. We will be mentioning him every week from now on. Plus: what we like doing on our birthdays, school plays, and pro-wrestling adaptations of Dickens.

                    <span>After basically remaking Bullfrog sim Theme Hospital with their first game, Two Point Studios are preparing to return with a new comedy management game. Today they announced Two Point Campus will launch on the 17th of May, inviting us to build and run universities. All I need to know is that it seems one of the courses you can run involves cooking giant pizzas the size of a minibus. Is this real? Did I miss megapizza when I dropped out of university?

                    <span>Boomerangs are cool as hell. The sleek wooden objects careen through the air in a perfect circle - in theory, at least - before returning right back to where they began in the palm of your hand. They’re something that fascinated me as a child, and 20-something years later I still don’t really know how or why they work.


Deflector is like someone taped two swords to a boomerang, Mad Max-style. How does the boomerang still operate with twin blades slashing back and forth on either end? Don’t know. How does it always circle its way back to where you’re standing after dashing around an arena filled with enemies? Not a clue.

                    <span>When warp-tunneling multiplayer shooter Splitgate came zooming out of its beta portal, gun barrels aflame, it was joyful madness. The maps were some of the best things about it. Old-school mega-arenas adorned with portal-zappable walls that functioned as DIY shortcuts. As virtual coliseums of chaos go, they were pretty cool. Well, now you can make your own. Splitgate is launching into season 1 this week (the developers insist the last four months have been &quot;season 0&quot;) and alongside a couple of new game modes, there&#x27;s now a map creation tool.

That&#x27;s FixFox for you, an upcoming sci-fi adventure game developed by Rendlike which looks like the video game equivalent of a soothing balm.

It&#x27;ll come as both a game rule for everyone and new options for modders to work with. It&#x27;s taken longer than expected, but Paradox adding an option for same-sex marriage without using mods is more than they had initially planned, so that&#x27;s nice.

                    <span>My personal top Twitter tip: add pleasant breaks to the nightmares of your feed by following a few good image accounts or bots which regularly post nice things. I like accounts which post rock formations or bots which generate landscapes. Perhaps you find comfort in violence? If so, you might enjoy interrupting your doomscrolling with the Doomscroll Doom Bot, a Twitter bot which is very slowly posting a complete playthrough of Ultimate Doom, one frame every hour.
