Game Freak is best known around the world as the Pokémon developer, but it also works on other projects from time to time.
In a recent interview with VGC, Game Freak&#x27;s Masafumi Saito spoke about how beneficial it was to the Japanese company to create &quot;original games&quot; - describing it as a great challenge, a great motivator for creators, and mentioning how &quot;significant&quot; it was in terms of growth:

During Xbox&#x27;s Developer Direct, Mojang confirmed Minecraft Legends would be arriving on April 18th, 2023 on Switch.
In case you missed it, this is a new action-strategy game where you&#x27;ll lead your allies into heroic battles and defend the famous Minecraft overworld from mobs of destructive piglins. You&#x27;ll even be able to challenge or team up with friends. Here&#x27;s a bit about the gameplay trailer above:

GoldenEye 007 is arguably a timeless classic, but visually speaking it&#x27;s looking a little dated. Fortunately, the re-release is getting a facelift.
The new version for the Switch Online Expansion Pack service is certainly looking sharper and smoother, and to see just how much it&#x27;s improved, the YouTube channel GameXplain has put together a brief comparison video - showing off the new Switch trailer, alongside the original 1997 release.

No, you&#x27;re not dreaming - Rare&#x27;s legendary N64 shooter GoldenEye 007 is actually coming to the Nintendo Switch this week. Yes, after ongoing requests, it&#x27;s finally making a comeback on the Switch Online Expansion Pack service this Friday.
Although we&#x27;ll never truly know just how difficult it has been to revive this classic first-person shooter, not long after the release date was locked in yesterday, Xbox&#x27;s head Phil Spencer took a moment to acknowledge &quot;the journey&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s gaming division has been on to make it happen. As you might recall, there have been a lot of licensing issues to overcome and there was even a cancelled remaster along the way. Here&#x27;s exactly what he had to say:

                              <span>They later become the Doom Illuminati
The retro-inspired shooter genre is really in high gear. Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.
Dread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.

Zombie survival MMO The Day Before was due to launch fairly soon. But now its developer Fntastic has pushed the launch back into November and delayed a gameplay showcase, citing concerns over the trademark of the name.
In a statement from the developer, Fntastic says that Steam has blocked The Day Before&#x27;s page at the request of a &quot;private individual&quot; because of the game&#x27;s name, The Day Before. Fntastic claims that sometime after The Day Before was announced, someone filed an application to register the trademark for The Day Before in the United States, linked here.
Fntastic and publisher Mytona claim they were not aware of this, and only found out on January 19, when they received a complaint from the trademark holder.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</span>

The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry &quot;a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series.&quot; For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

                              <span>During Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio&#x27;s previous games, it&#x27;s a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games&#x27; Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango&#x27;s other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year&#x27;s Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It&#x27;s directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang&#x27;s latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team&#x27;s base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.</span>

Revealed during today’s Xbox Developer Direct, a new games showcase event from the company, The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom brings players to eastern Morrowind, a location studio head Matt Firor says hasn&#x27;t been in an Elder Scrolls game since 1994. 


Players will encounter Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince last seen in the Dragonborn DLC for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in Necrom. Firor also revealed that Necrom will add the Arcanist class to the MMO, which allows players to channel different types of magic, like destructive, restorative, and defensive magic.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
&quot;Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you&#x27;ll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone.&quot;

Microsoft released its second quarter financial results for the 2023 fiscal year yesterday, and it revealed that Xbox gaming revenue declined 13% overall. Xbox content and services, such as first-party software and monetization in third-party games, declined 12%, but Microsoft notes that this decline is up against a &quot;strong prior year comparable.&quot; Given that Xbox&#x27;s 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn&#x27;t surprising.
However, the financial results state that this 12% decline is &quot;partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.&quot; Xbox hardware revenue has also declined 13%. During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Xbox&#x27;s monthly act…</span>

                              <span>Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland&#x27;s resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will &quot;keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life.&quot;

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe &quot;who was in a dating relationship with the defendant.&quot; 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland&#x27;s attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year&#x27;s High On Life.</span>

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games.

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s spring plans are set in motion
The curtains have closed on Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer Direct. The roughly 45-minute showcase spotlighted a taste of the year ahead for Xbox studios, running the gamut from updates on big launches to an out-now surprise.
It was, I think, a pretty solid showcase. Direct and to-the-point, the studios under Microsoft&#x27;s banner showed off just what&#x27;s in store in the coming months and year. Granted, this isn&#x27;t all that Xbox has in store; we didn&#x27;t see Starfield, though we knew we wouldn&#x27;t going in.
This felt like a nice check-in for the new year. A few games finally locked in their release dates, the Forza team at Turn10 got to show off their rad tech, and Tango Gameworks dropped a surprise. Here&#x27;s the rundown.

Disney&#x27;s Dreamlight Valley has taken over my free time. I was looking for a cozy new simulator to play, and so far this title has ticked all the boxes for me. I found it to be a bummer that I was nearing the end of all of the content released as of now, so I was waiting with bated breath to hear any news about what&#x27;s to come. My prayers have finally been answered, because Gameloft just laid out their plans for their free updates in 2023, as reported by GameSpot. This year has a ton in store for the game, including a multiplayer mode, new characters, realms, clothing, motifs, decorations, and furniture.
First up in February, the game will be welcoming two new villagers: Mirabel from Encanto and Olaf from Frozen. We&#x27;ll also be able to &quot;d…</span>

                              <span>Take a bite out of this spooky adventure later this spring
With previous releases like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, Arkane has one of the most solid track records out there. Fans have been anxiously awaiting their newest release, vampire FPS Redfall. The game will feature a roster of playable characters who all utilize unique abilities to take down the vampires that are terrorizing the isolated town of Redfall. We got an in-depth look at what to expect from the gameplay during today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, including character skill trees, a whole host of weapons and gadgets, and encounters that players will come across in the game&#x27;s &quot;immersive open world.&quot; The most exciting news of all, though, is the official release date for Redfall, which the developers from Arkane announced as May 2, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cR8GVePOdpY
From where I stand, Redfall really looks like a culmination of everything Arkane has created so far, such as the studio&#x27;s focus on complex problem-solving with multiple ways to approach any given situation, allowing players to truly craft their build around how they want to play with different items and skill trees, and of course their endlessly-compelling means of storytelling through complex characters and environments. I&#x27;m greatly looking forward to giving Redfall a go, especially with friends along the way to further enjoy the spooky atmosphere and dynamic gameplay encounters.

                              <span>Feel the rush
Tango Gameworks has something a bit different in store for its next game. Hi-Fi Rush is a musical rhythm-focused action game, coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S consoles today.
Revealed during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, everything in Hi-Fi Rush is connected to the beat. The whole world, from its action and combos to the traps and scenery, moves to the rhythm.
Playing as Chai, a &quot;defect&quot; who can detect the rhythm of the world, you team up with pals to take on your enemies. It&#x27;s got a vibe similar to something like Sunset Overdrive, and I&#x27;m very much down for it.
https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1618344785357447221
The team wants it to be playable for those who aren&#x27;t so rhytmically inclined too, though. Chai&#x27;s cat, the appropriately named 808, can keep the beat for you as a little helper drone. And a marker at the bottom of the screen can also track the BPM for you.
While Tango Gameworks may be known for series like The Evil Within or the more recent Ghostwire: Tokyo, which falls more into the dark and scary, Hi-Fi Rush is a bit of a departure. And the added surprise, revealed during the show, is that it goes live tonight. Being an Xbox studio game, too, it&#x27;s also part of Xbox Game Pass.

Minecraft is one of the most beloved franchises in all of gaming that has inspired a slew of spin-offs into other genres. The newest entry in the Minecraft franchise is delving into even more unexplored territory in the form of Minecraft Legends, an action strategy game that was announced at last year&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase. This title has made an appearance at the same event in 2023, this time revealing a brand new gameplay trailer, as well as an official release date: April 18, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yaL6XQZISq0
The trailer showed off the game&#x27;s overworld, which players will be able to roam freely on horseback, as well as combat with &quot;familiar foes&quot; and &quot;unexpected allies.&quot; We also got a brief look at the Minecraft Legends&#x27; online features, as players will be able to play co-operatively with friends, or challenge them to play as opponents. Between the adorable Minecraft art style to the bombastic gameplay, this title looks like it&#x27;s going to be a blast for action strategy lovers and long-time Minecraft fans alike.
Minecraft Legends will be available for Xbox platforms (including Xbox Game Pass), Windows/Steam, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders are available right now, so make sure to check it out if the game piques your interest.

The Employee of the Month Edition of the 2020 adventure will launch on both platforms February 14, priced at $29.99. Free upgrades will be afforded to current PS4/Xbox One players, so huzzah to that. This edition will feature the previously released Hot Garbage DLC, native or upscaled 4K resolution options, Performance vs. Graphics toggles, and an overhauled Photo Mode. You can check out the full details of the new edition and its features in a new blog post on the 505 Games website.

Developed by Typhoon Studios, Journey to the Savage Planet presents a messy and light-hearted romp through the stratosphere, as a faithful employee of the Kindred Aerospace corporation explores an uncharted, rainbow-colored planet — ARY-26 — in order to establish whether it would be suitable for human colonization. The protagonist battles alien lifeforms and dodges environmental hazards while cataloging the world and its strange flora and fauna. Savage Planet received mostly positive reviews on release, praised for its fun creature design, welcoming aesthetic, and satirical edge.

                              <span>Filling in a cultural gap
I have a confession to make: I missed out on Metal Gear Solid. I was a lame kid who liked cartoony platformers and power-of-friendship RPGs, and Hideo Kojima&#x27;s epic saga of gruff military boys in cardboard boxes did nothing for my brain. Still, I figured I understood what Metal Gear was based on pop culture osmosis - baffling lore, thoughtful political intrigue, and brief interludes of intense homoeroticism, all in a 3D stealth shooting package.
So imagine my surprise when I went on my very first journey with Solid Snake and didn&#x27;t see any of that. See, when I start a task, I like to start it from the beginning. So when I committed to getting into Metal Gear, I went straight for entry numero uno: 1987&#x27;s Metal Gear for the MSX 2.

Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life is locking in for a summer trip back out to the farm. The reimagined version of the original farming-life sim classic arrives on June 27, 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.
This new Story of Seasons is a remake of the GameCube-era classic, which North American fans might better know as Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. Much like other Story of Seasons games, it follows the player&#x27;s efforts to make their farm flourish, through both crops and livestock, as well as develop social bonds with other characters.
The general appeal of these games is actually pretty well summed-up by this new trailer. It&#x27;s a papercraft version of A Wonderful Life&#x27;s basic premise, and you&#x27;re going to wan…</span>

A Californian judge has rejected Microsoft&#x27;s request that a lawsuit opposing its acquisition of Activision Blizzard is &quot;paused&quot; until after the publisher completes its pending lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — itself a lawsuit opposing the $68.7 billion merger.
The so-called &quot;Gamer Lawsuit&quot; was filed by Alioto Law Firm and the Joseph Saveri Law Firm in December 2022, and represents a party of citizens who are against Microsoft&#x27;s proposed purchase of the World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 developer. As reported by Axios&#x27; Stephen Tolito, Microsoft had attempted to put this particular suit on hold whilst it focuses its efforts on the more prominent FTC lawsuit, but will seemingly have to take on both suits simultaneously.

Petoons Studio&#x27;s long-in-development adventure title Curse of the Sea Rats is finally ready to up anchor and set sail on the indie seas — The &quot;Ratoidvania&quot; will finally launch on PC and console platforms April 6, bringing its animated anthropomorphic action to players everywhere.
Curse of the Sea Rats, as we have reported many a time, is the tale of a party of British colonial prisoners, who find themselves cursed by the wicked pirate witch, Flora Burn. Now morphed into rodent form, it is up to rebellious heroes David Douglas, Buffalo Calf, Akane Yamakawa, and Bussa to journey far and wide, battle their way across the Irish coast, locate Flora Burn, and have her return them to their human form.

Of course, the odyssey will be a difficult one, as our uniquely skilled quartet will face an array of dangers and an army of enemies — all itching for a bout of pint-sized pugilism. A brand new trailer, which you can check out above, introduces us to some of the boss characters that await David &amp; Co. including the killer crab Krabawaki, the sadistic Freddy Eightfingers, the beautiful but deadly Rama Cinnamon, and bad boys Fatso &amp; Fatsie. It&#x27;s gonna be a fight, that&#x27;s fer true.
It&#x27;s been three long years since we first wrote of Curse of the Sea Rats, and the team at Petoons has been plugging away at their challenging adventure every day, week, and month since. Supported by a passionate player community, and with a release date now on the horizon, here&#x27;s hoping that the team&#x27;s dedication and hard work will pay off, delivering a pint-sized epic for adventure fans, whiskers and all.
Curse of the Sea Rats launches April 6 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Prepare your Walther PPKs, Golden Guns, and Oddjob Chops, as Nintendo and Microsoft have announced that one of the most beloved and nostalgically held games of all time, GoldenEye 007 will be making its grand return via the Nintendo Switch Online and Xbox Game Pass services as soon as January 27. That&#x27;s this Friday!
The classic first-person shooter, developed by Rare and launched for the Nintendo 64 in 1997, is an adaptation of the 1995 film, which saw Pierce Brosnan don the shoulder holster as James Bond 007 for the very first time. While the game&#x27;s single-player campaign holds incredible memories for players of a certain age, it is GoldenEye 007&#x27;s multiplayer mode that is best remembered for delivering hours upon hours of amazing multiplayer battles between friends.

The Nintendo Switch Online edition of GoldenEye 007 will indeed feature both the single-player and multiplayer modes in their entirety, bolstered by online play for the first time (officially) in the game&#x27;s history. Unfortunately, the Xbox Game Pass edition will not feature online play, so you&#x27;ll have to dial up the crew and get them &#x27;round for some old-school, remote-mine-flinging action.
The new release will be available to all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack and Xbox Game Pass subscribers and will hopefully provide as much joy today as it did 25 years ago — with all of its wonky animations, square heads, and not-at-all-annoying-Natalya-constantly-running-into-your-line-of-fire.
For England, James?

                              <span>Rick and Morty creator also dropped by Adult Swim
Justin Roiland, the creator of popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, has resigned as CEO of developer Squanch Games — The studio behind the recently released sci-fi shooter High on Life.
The announcement of the resignation comes less than 24 hours after TV network Adult Swim also announced that it had terminated its relationship with the Roiland, after the producer was officially charged with felony domestic battery with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud, and/or deceit, as reported by NBC News.
https://twitter.com/SquanchGames/status/1618049809256185856?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;xRyA96fenpaQ8QeeqbwnWg
The charges, which stem from an incident that reportedly took place in January 2020 were first leveled against Justin Roiland in May 2020, with the producer having already faced several court hearings on the case. This week, however, has been the first time the events have been brought to light by the mainstream media. Roiland has pleaded Not Guilty to all charges. A date for the trial is yet to be set.
In the wake of the charges coming to light, Kotaku unearthed a previously unreported lawsuit wherein a former Squanch Games employee claims that she was sexually harassed by a male co-worker while at the studio, and later fired for &quot;poor performance&quot; after she filed an official complaint about the incident with management. This case, which took place in 2018, was eventually settled in September of 2019. It should be noted that the co-worker in question is not Roiland.
Adult Swim has noted that it will continue the production of Season 7 of Rick &amp; Morty with the lead characters expected to be recast.

                              <span>It seems the iconic Red Rocket station will be featured in the show
With the success of HBO&#x27;s adaptation of The Last of Us, the future for game-to-TV adaptations is looking brighter than ever. We don&#x27;t have a ton of info on Amazon&#x27;s Fallout series as of yet, but based on my optimism and some unofficial photos of the set that have leaked on Twitter, it looks like this series will at least have the set design to contend with some of the greats that have come before it. A fan who goes by J Carson on Twitter found the show&#x27;s set still under construction in New York and was able to snap a whole series of photos, which feature the real-life replica of Fallout&#x27;s famed Red Rocket filling station.

                              <span>No more one-shot kills for Hog mains
Overwatch 2 is a constant balancing act of buffing and nerfing heroes as the meta changes, and the character on the chopping block this time around is none other than everyone&#x27;s favorite hook-wielding heavyweight, Roadhog. He was known for his hook-shoot-melee combo that could kill players in one shot, which I knew all too well as a Mercy main.
The Overwatch 2 devs said that &quot;these changes aim to reduce the frustration of dying in one shot immediately after being hooked and pulled by Roadhog,&quot; while also reassuring players that his hook is still a &quot;powerful utility to forcibly reposition enemy players.&quot; The full details of Roadhog&#x27;s nerf are as follows per the official patch notes:

It doesn&#x27;t get much more classic than chess. I mean, it was invented back in the 15th century, best we can tell, and it&#x27;s still one of the most popular games played around the world today. Nothing highlights this sentiment more than the fact that Chess.com, the foremost online chess platform that you can play right in your browser, is crashing simply because it has gotten so popular, the servers can&#x27;t handle all of the traffic anymore. Originally spotted by PC Gamer, Chess.com posted an official statement to their blog yesterday letting us on in why these issues are occurring, and why the game has gotten so popular in the first place.

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: The Spot Dodge crew discusses the latest entry in the Fire Emblem series, Fire Emblem Engage. The team also predicts when the next Nintendo Direct will happen. Because there has to be one just around the corner, right? Right..!?

I&#x27;m loving Fire Emblem Engage so far. The combat is intense, the visuals are solid, and the pacing is damn near perfect. However, Fire Emblem Engage is lacking in a few important areas, story and characters. A key area previous Fire Emblem games thrived in.

One of the best non-mechs I&#x27;ve tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it&#x27;s down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

One that doesn&#x27;t feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they&#x27;ve ever been before.

                              <span>So those Tango Gameworks leaks turned out to be true. After repeatedly stating that this evening&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It&#x27;s a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there&#x27;s an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it&#x27;s out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

                              <span>The original Pharaoh, released in 1999, was a lot of people&#x27;s first citybuilder. In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I&#x27;m the dad now, and the &quot;full remake&quot; Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

                              <span>A fast-paced game that&#x27;s all about reflecting bullets back with a katana sounds great to me, a known fan of parrying projectiles. I bought new indie game Agent In Depth within 20 seconds of seeing it. Then I played it. Oh no. I feel old. Am I too old? What I can tell you is, if you like fast-paced action platformers with bullets to parry, instadeath to punish you, and no checkpoints to support you, you might enjoy this. It&#x27;s only £2 to find out.

                              <span>Last time, you decided overwhelmingly (94%!) that knocking folks over edges is better than big engines rising from the bonnet. Honestly, I cannot disagree. I adore that giant supercharged engine. I will always pick the cars with that giant supercharged engine. But imagine if someone were standing atop that giant supercharged engine&#x27;s towering intake, and I kicked them off it. Glorious! This week, I must apologise, but circumstances have led us to a choice between two wholly dissimilar things. What&#x27;s better: a pre-boss battle supply cache, or resources too good to use?

                              <span>Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

                              <span>Sneaky new photos taken of the set of Amazon’s Fallout TV adaptation have been shared on Twitter that show one of the retro-futuristic series’ Red Rocket gas stations being built. While the chain’s distinctive rocket doesn’t feature in any of the snaps, all taken by J. Carson in New York state, you can clearly make out the Red Rocket branding on its sign and bright red atomic fuel pumps. The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

                              <span>We’re still a month and a bit away from The Last Of Us Part 1 arriving on PC, but it sounds as though the TV adaptation is doing well enough to land itself a second season. Actor Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last Of Us show alongside Pedro Pascal as Joel, told the BBC that she reckons Season 2 is “pretty likely”. Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There&#x27;s nothing confirmed yet so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see,” she said.

                              <span>Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

                              <span>I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there&#x27;s been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix&#x27;s newfound PC love-in would mean I&#x27;d be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn&#x27;t, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that&#x27;s okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII&#x27;s Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

In the latest unusual twist in The Day Before&#x27;s development, Fntastic shared a statement explaining the delay that credits it to a US trademark filing that the company overlooked. Oddly, The Day Before’s store page also seems to have disappeared from Steam within the past day.

                              <span>Microsoft have reported worldwide technical issues with multiple Microsoft services this morning, including Minecraft, Xbox Live, Teams, Outlook and other 365 products. In a Twitter thread from Microsoft&#x27;s 365 Status account, they said the problems have been caused by “networking configuration issues”, and that a recent network change had been rolled back. It&#x27;s hoped this will solve the access problems people have faced trying to use these services this morning, but lingering issues may still be kicking about.

For the most part, people seem pretty clued up on Pokémon facts. The franchise has grown so large, in fact, that whenever you think that you know a piece of information so obscure that it is bound to astonish those around you, there&#x27;s always somebody there to say &quot;well obviously, duh!&quot;
We have found ourselves in such a predicament today when we stumbled across the following information in a @SuperPodSaga Twitter thread asking people to share their &quot;most useless piece of video game knowledge&quot;. One user called @SourceLocator shared the game-changing insight that in generations one to three of the Pokémon games, the HM &#x27;Cut&#x27; could be used to chop down tall grass.

This week — today, in fact — marks an astonishing four years since the announcement that work on Metroid Prime 4 had been restarted from scratch and shifted over to original developer Retro Studios.
We all remember the day when Shinya Takahashi, Senior Managing Executive Officer at Nintendo, spoke directly and apologetically to audiences to announce that &quot;the current development progress has not reached the standards we seek in a sequel to the Metroid Prime series&quot;. The news came as somehow both devastating and exciting for fans of the franchise. Disappointing that Prime 4 was inevitably a very long way off, but also heartening to see Retro back at the helm.

Arguably one of the most adorable arcade titles out there, The NewZealand Story is waddling its way onto Hamster&#x27;s Arcade Archives collection this week (thanks, Nintendo Everything) and will be turning us all against seals once again.
Originally released in 1988, this classic platformer sees you play as Tiki, a kiwi who is forced out on a rescue mission after his girlfriend and pals are kidnapped by a leopard seal. It&#x27;s one of those &quot;cute character, tough game&quot; Taito titles like Bubble Bobble, and this one is all about exploring a series of deadly mazes to free your flightless friends.

                              <span>Get your skates on.
The debut title for South Australian-based indie studio Melonhead Games, Rooftop Renegade, looks to be a mix between OlliOlli World&#x27;s slick skating platforming and the art of rollerblading (or &#x27;hoverblading&#x27;, if we&#x27;re being picky). What&#x27;s more, publisher The IndiEXP has announced that the title will be rolling its way onto Switch on 17th February.
It is true, this is certainly a departure from the chilled out vibes of last year&#x27;s skater-platformer — there&#x27;s far more guns and explosions this time around — but it is nice to see the 2D skating (even if it is of the roller-kind) coming through.

Publisher Atari has announced Caverns of Mars Recharged, the latest in its line of revamped classic titles for the Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Holy smokes!
It was back in August that we last heard of Saga of Sins — the demon hunting action platformer that looks like a moving stained glass window — but publisher Just For Games has now announced that this sin-slaying cleric will be bringing his religious rebellion to Switch on 30th March, 2023.
For those of you who missed the initial announcement, Saga of Sins sees you play as a mind-hopping cleric on a mission to purge the seven deadly sins from the thoughts of a local village. Sounds weird enough? Well, developers Bonus Level Entertainment ensure that it only gets stranger from here! The cleric can take on four different forms to combat these beasties (a werewolf, gargoyle, griffin and one more mystery transformation) and the whole thing takes place with a particularly church-y visual style.

Fire Emblem Engage has been widely praised at launch, but it seems the day one update may have introduced one minor issue tied to the title&#x27;s cooperative multiplayer Relay Trials mode. As highlighted by Nintendo&#x27;s official customer support social media account, the gaming giant is aware of player reports and is &quot;currently investigating&quot; the problem.
As explained by Siliconera, the issue occurs when selecting &quot;take over&quot; after &quot;random&quot; in the Relay Trials. When selecting &quot;take over&quot; - it will come up with the current message &quot;no data to take over&quot;. Here&#x27;s a rough translation of Nintendo&#x27;s customer support tweet:

‘Ey up, adventure fans! Are you hankering for a grave-robbing escapade reminiscent of Indiana Jones? But do you wish it were set in Yorkshire, trading jaw-dropping Incan ziggurats for drizzly moors? Well, have we got t’ game for you!
The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow puts your clicking finger in the shoes of one Thomasina Bateman, roving archaeologist and author. The book she’s compiling is a survey of the barrows of England – barrows being burial mounds. The latest lump of dirt to be profiled in this riveting tome is the game’s titular Hob’s Barrow, on the outskirts of the simple Yorkshire village of Bewlay.

Fire Emblem Engage arrived on the scene last week, and as usual, dataminers have been sifting through the game&#x27;s files to uncover hidden secrets. One, in particular, that seems to have gained some traction focuses on the latest entry&#x27;s codename.
Based on previous datamines, it&#x27;s known how Fire Emblem games follow a certain pattern when it comes to their development codenames. As explained by modder and dataminer &#x27;DeathChaos25&#x27; on Twitter, Fire Emblem Engage is internally coded as &quot;Iron19&quot;. Where it gets interesting is the fact the previous mainline game Fire Emblem: Three Houses is codenamed &quot;Iron17&quot;.

Mario Strikers: Battle League made its debut on the Nintendo Switch last June and since then it&#x27;s received a bunch of free updates - comprised of new characters, levels and even some new features.
Following the release of Version 1.3.0 last month, Nintendo and Next Level Games have now rolled out the next patch. This is a much smaller one - fixing a minor but pesky issue with Rainbow ? Blocks. Here&#x27;s the full rundown, courtesy of the official support page:

                              <span>Expected to be squared away in time for the Linux 6.3 kernel cycle, which is kicking off in February, is Automatic IBRS as a new feature of Zen 4 processors. The patches already have been queued up into TIP&#x27;s x86/cpu branch so barring any issues will be all wired up for this next kernel version. Automatic IBRS can provide better performance than the Retpolines implementation used currently on Zen 4 and prior CPUs as part of the Spectre V2 mitigations. With the switch over to Automatic IBRS for Zen 4, it means better performance in some areas as shown by these benchmarks today with AMD 4th Gen EPYC &quot;Genoa&quot; processors.</span>

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them.

Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.

The nominees for the 2023 Independent Games Festival Awards are locked in. And after a stellar year for independent games, the categories look pretty packed with viable candidates.
Both action-adventure game Tunic and dreamlike RPG Betrayal at Club Low leads the nominations at three apiece. Some other familiar faces from awards season also appear, including Immortality, Neon White, and NORCO.

                              <span>A CWA statement lays the blame at CEO&#x27;s feet
Proletariat, a studio under Activision Blizzard, has withdrawn its bid for unionization. In a statement today, the Communication Workers of America pins the fault on Proletariat CEO Seth Sivak.
In a statement (via GamesIndustry.biz) on the matter, the CWA—which has worked with other organizing studios under Activision Blizzard—confirms it has withdrawn its request for a representative election at Proletariat.
&quot;Unfortunately, Proletariat CEO Seth Sivak chose to follow Activision Blizzard&#x27;s lead and responded to the workers&#x27; desire to form a union with confrontational tactics,&quot; reads the CWA&#x27;s statement. &quot;Like many founders, he took the workers&#x27; concerns as a personal attack and held a series of meetings that demoralized and disempowered the group…</span>

                              <span>Bungie is already on the case
The way games are made these days, any small change can send the whole house of cards toppling down — live service games are in an even more precarious situation due to constant updates. Destiny 2 is currently taking a hit in this regard, and a pretty big one at that. The issue has caused the progress of some of the Triumphs to reset, which has removed already-earned Seals from some players. Of course, those affected aren&#x27;t exactly thrilled, as the Triumph objectives take a great deal of time and effort to complete, but thankfully Bungie is already working on a hotfix, as they announced on Twitter this morning.
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1617959541685235713
Bungie also stated that they&#x27;re extending the ongoing maintenance time for the hotfix by four hours, meaning the new end time will be 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. The game will go offline shortly to get everything sorted, so here&#x27;s hoping it doesn&#x27;t take long to get things back on track.
This bug entered the game after the release of Hotfix 6.3.0.5, which got rid of blue engrams and therefore removed the soft gear cap — now players who were otherwise maxed out will receive Glimmer drops instead. It&#x27;s a welcome change that players have been asking for, but unfortunately, this bug has soured the mood in the community a bit.

                              <span>Riot say it&#x27;s not paying the ransom
League of Legends studio Riot Games has now confirmed that, following a recent cyberattack, hackers took source code for both League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics, as well as a legacy anti-cheat platform. But after being sent a ransom demand, Riot says it won&#x27;t be paying.
Last week, Riot announced its systems were compromised in a social engineering attack, a method that also resulted in the massive Grand Theft Auto leak last  year. No player or personal data was obtained, but today Riot confirms that source code for the aforementioned programs was taken. The attackers submitted a ransom demand, but Riot Games says it will not be paying.
&quot;While this attack disrupted our build environment and could cause issues in the future, most importantly we remain confident that no player data or player personal information was compromised,&quot; said Riot in a statement. &quot;Truthfully, any exposure of source code can increase the likelihood of new cheats emerging. Since the attack, we’ve been working to assess its impact on anticheat and to be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly as possible if needed.&quot;
Prototypes and sources
While the source code contained a number of experimental features, Riot says most of it is in prototype and may or may not be released in the future. The company is working with external consultants to audit the attack, and plans to release a report on it in the future. Also, Riot confirms it is working with law enforcement as they investigate the group behind the attack.
&quot;We’ve made a lot of progress since last week and we believe we’ll have things repaired later in the week, which will allow us to remain on our regular patch cadence going forward,&quot; reads Riot&#x27;s statement. &quot;The League and TFT teams will update you soon on what this means for each game.&quot;

                              <span>Portable power!
The most popular current-generation console is a handheld. Computer companies with limited experience in the console market are jumping in with handhelds of their own. There&#x27;s no denying it: portable gaming is in the midst of a renaissance. But as companies continue to release handheld consoles, and as consumers continue to buy them, I&#x27;m struck by an interesting question: what was the last mainstream handheld game?
I&#x27;m not talking about a game that you can play on a handheld. At this point, you can play basically any game ever made on a handheld. I&#x27;m talking about a game built for handhelds, one that benefits from a smaller form factor, lower processing power, and increased portability. Handheld consoles are about as big as they&#x27;ve ever been... so where are all the handheld…</span>

As a lifelong fan of Final Fantasy, the series has gotten a bad rap this past decade.
Between Final Fantasy XV&#x27;s tumultuous development cycle, Final Fantasy XIV’s abysmal state at launch, and Final Fantasy XIII’s… well, existence, fan opinion of the brand has soured. This makes it hard to remember that, once upon a time, Final Fantasy was one of the most beloved names in gaming. It set the standard for JRPGs across multiple consoles with cutting edge aesthetics and gameplay systems that became industry standards. That&#x27;s not to say every recent Final Fantasy is bad, but it&#x27;s important that the heights of the franchise are not forgotten. This is a series whose legacy will endure forever, no matter how many stupid NFTs Square Enix tries to sell.

Supermassive Games has announced that its upcoming VR ghost train The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR will no longer meet its previously announced February 22 release date — The spooky-ooky title will now be jump scaring onto the PSVR2 platform on March 16.
&quot;It has always been our aim to release in the launch window of the new PlayStation VR2 headset but it is also massively important to us that you, the players, receive the most polished, terrifying experience possible when you strap in for your first ride in The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR,&quot; writes Supermassive Games in a press statement.
&quot;With this in mind, we have made the difficult decision to set a new launch date of March 16, 2023.&quot;

Described as Supermassive&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious virtual reality project to date&quot;, Switchback VR will plunge players into an immersive, atmospheric, and super-scary 3D world, as they ride a literal rollercoaster through five distinct regions, inspired by the stories of the studio&#x27;s horror anthology series, The Dark Pictures. So be prepared to visit the ghouls, witches, and demons of Man of Medan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and the most recent entry, The Devil in Me.
The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR will launch on March 16. The PSVR2 hardware launches worldwide on February 22, priced at a somewhat princely $550 USD. Who says you can&#x27;t put a price on terror?

                              <span>It&#x27;s a small world after all...
Publisher Microids, in association with Rochelais indie studio Tower Five, has released the first screenshots for the intriguing-looking insect adventure Empire of the Ants, which is currently in development for PC and console platforms, with a tentative 2024 release window.
Based on Bernard Werber&#x27;s 1991 sci-fi novel Les Fourmis, (&quot;The Ants&quot;), Empire of the Ants will see layers don the form of a soldier ant, charged with leading its lost colony to safer, finer pastures. Utilizing the power of Unreal 5, Tower Five is attempting to construct a photo-realistic macro world — one that will hopefully encompass the dangers and struggles that face our hard-working friends on a day-to-day basis.

As the self-appointed colony head, the player must guide the ants over and across a variety of different environments, battling various predators and threats, as well as surviving the powerful, all-consuming seasons. Keep your &quot;people&quot; alive, fend off aggressors, and find a new home in which to thrive.
These first screenshots depict the protagonist as they confront ladybirds, scour for sustenance, and face down rival colonies. Even at this early stage, it looks pretty fascinating, and brings to mind the unique, small-world joys of 2009 Wii release Deadly Creatures. 

And even without a windswept Joan Collins screaming and swinging around a boat oar, or a small, midwestern town populated by pheromone-controlled rednecks on patrol, Tower Five&#x27;s creepy-crawly title has definitely made its way onto my radar.
Empire of the Ants is currently in development for PC and consoles. It is scheduled to launch in 2024.

                              <span>The GBA-era strategy game heads to PC
Handheld strategy classic Yggdra Union is heading to a new platform. Sting confirms today that it&#x27;s bringing the strategy RPG to PC via Steam on February 6, 2023.
Originally released for the Game Boy Advance in 2006, Yggdra Union is a top-down, turn-based strategy game that has you mixing and combining formations called unions to take down your enemy. While it received a PlayStation Portable port a couple years after the  GBA version, North America still hasn&#x27;t received its mobile or Switch port from more recent years.
With the Steam version, Sting will have full English support for the interface, audio, and subtitles. Sting notes the title is heading into Early Access, where it will be for about three to five months, as the team fixes bugs and adjusts…</span>

The second episode of The Last of Us television series is here, and regardless of what any given viewer thinks of the show, no one can deny that the creators are taking risks. While the premiere episode laid out a solid introduction to the series, it still left a lot of fans wondering what direction the story might take in the coming weeks. But this week&#x27;s episode, &quot;Infected,&quot; set a whole new tone, for better or for worse. Whether or not you liked it, there&#x27;s no denying that this second chapter laid it all out there and made some bold choices. It&#x27;s up to us to discuss and decide if the changes were worth it. Let&#x27;s break down the episode, and get into it.

                              <span>Gentlemen, start your graphics cards...
Today sees the launch of Square Enix&#x27; spellbound epic Forspoken, which is available to purchase now on PS5 and PC platforms — In addition, a new blog post by developer Luminous Productions has announced that a PC demo will launch later today on Steam, Epic Games Store, and Microsoft Store.
The Forspoken demo will give PC users the opportunity to check out Forspoken&#x27;s effect-laden magic adventure for themselves, allowing those on the fence from a technical standpoint to see whether their rig matches up to the game&#x27;s meaty visuals. Having played the title on PS5, I initially struggled to see why the PC specifications seemed so lofty. Upon reaching several of the game&#x27;s boss encounters, (particularly the impressive &quot;Tanta&quot; battles), it became quite clear that Forspoken would be pretty greedy on the ol&#x27; GFX. I don&#x27;t think my Radeon x700 is going to get the job done.

Forspoken follows the story of Frey Holland, a troubled street kid who finds herself plucked from the streets of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and deposited in Athia, a fantasy world under siege from a smothering corruption known as &quot;The Break&quot;. Bound with a sentient vanbrace dubbed &quot;Cuff&quot;. This original odd cuffle ventures through Athia&#x27;s huge open world, hoping to challenge its founders, restore the land, and get our girl back home to her beloved moggie, Homer.
Forspoken launches today on PS5 and PC. You can check out our review for the new title right here.

                              <span>A story ran on Bloomberg earlier today with the headline “Blizzard Manager Departs In Protest of Employee Ranking System”. It sounds very businessy, maybe something that would land on the Linkedin news feed of a HR manager, but the stuff it’s describing is important because it sounds absolutely dystopian.

Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today&#x27;s example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That&#x27;s an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

                              <span>Fun story: I didn’t know what Qbasic Gorillas was called for over 20 years.
As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

                              <span>A fix is on the way for the security vulnerabilities discovered earlier this week in Grand Theft Auto Online, Rockstar have said today. Players began efforts to alert Rockstar to the issues en masse over the weekend, after some nefarious types took advantage of the issues to disrupt the game for other people. Rockstar Support have tweeted that a security-related update is coming, but didn&#x27;t give a specific timeframe for it yet.

                              <span>Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the &#x27;touch anything and you&#x27;re dead&#x27; bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you&#x27;d also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

                              <span>Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it&#x27;s such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could &quot;live the book&quot;. Don&#x27;t bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we&#x27;d be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they&#x27;re achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t want to live in any of the books he&#x27;s been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in them because you&#x27;d only end up being a side character, and that&#x27;s boring.

                              <span>There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

                              <span>Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you&#x27;re given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it&#x27;s your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn&#x27;t most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you&#x27;re tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you&#x27;ll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they&#x27;re all swept away. 
It&#x27;s certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi&#x27;s undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio&#x27;s debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they&#x27;re tipped in your favour.

                              <span>Mimimi Games have been teasing their next stealth strategy game for over two years now, and finally, we know what it is. Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it&#x27;s all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

                              <span>After almost 14 years, I am still delighted by Windosill. It&#x27;s still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It&#x27;s such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it&#x27;s out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

                              <span>It’s only been a week since Microsoft announced they were laying off 10,000 human staff across their various divisions (including their games studios), but they&#x27;ve now revealed they’ll be investing billions of dollars into driving breakthroughs in AI. Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.

                              <span>Even before the monsters arrived, the USG Ishimura was a nightmare. 


I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

                              <span>You may have already heard that several outlets haven&#x27;t had review code for Forspoken, Squeenix&#x27;s magical parkour isekai game that&#x27;s out today and that some people have already decided they hate because of the dialogue. I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don&#x27;t have code, so no PC review from us for a while.
Like many others - and you too, if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 - I&#x27;ve been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl &quot;lemme get this straight?!&quot; credentials. And you know what? I don&#x27;t hate it!

To se provádí na straně klienta a serveru, nicméně podle jeho zjištění počet iterací KDF provedených na serveru nepřináší kvůli způsobu, jakým jsou implementovány, žádný bezpečnostní přínos. Z čehož vyplývá, že je potřeba ohlídat si nastavení KDF na straně klienta, protože dostatečně vysoký počet iterací hraje významnou roli ve zpomalení útočníka snažícího se uhádnout hlavní heslo trezoru.</span>

                              <span>Last week, The Last of Us&#x27; premiere scored HBO&#x27;s second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, &quot;Infected,&quot; has broken another HBO record.
&quot;Infected&quot; brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week&#x27;s 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network&#x27;s history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the &quot;largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,&quot; which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

For more Isaac Clarke, watch this extended Dead Space gameplay walkthrough that runs down the remake&#x27;s new features and then watch this new story trailer for Dead Space ahead of the game&#x27;s release this Friday. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Revealed yesterday during a Thunderful stream, SteamWorld Build is a new city-builder set in the SteamWorld universe due out sometime this year on consoles and PC. In it, your goal is to escape a dying planet and the only way to do this is by building a mining town to dig up &quot;vital long-lost technology.&quot; You&#x27;ll need to manage your city as the needs of it, and the citizens living there, grow, and you&#x27;ll have to defend your creation from the deadly creatures that lurk below.

                              <span>Last year, word puzzle Wordle swept through family WhatsApp groups across the planet and was quickly snapped up by the New York Times. In the wake of its success, several other games inspired by Wordle gained popularity, including Quordle, in which you attempt to uncover four words simultaneously.

Well, now it&#x27;s Quordle&#x27;s turn to be bought, as it&#x27;s been picked up by Merriam-Webster.

                              <span>Since about 2015, there&#x27;s been an Acer monitor of one kind or another on my desk. The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they&#x27;re also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer&#x27;s most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

                              <span>After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven&#x27;t seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one&#x27;s a citybuilder, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s Build that&#x27;s coming out first. 
After all, it&#x27;s been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That&#x27;s right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it&#x27;s a mining and tower defence &#x27;em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it&#x27;s really something special.

                              <span>Thunderful have just unveiled the next game in their excellent SteamWorld series, and it&#x27;s not the one we thought it was going to be. Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It&#x27;s a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it&#x27;s called SteamWorld Build. I&#x27;ve played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s a little bit good. If you just want the facts of what was announced, though, read on below.

                              <span>While Lunar New Year celebrations continue (I&#x27;m enjoying all the fireworks over my neighbourhood at night), you might fancy joining in by playing Tet. This lovely little free indie game has you zooming through minigames to prepare a dinner for a Vietnamese Lunar New Year party before all your guests arrive. Chop this, fry those, and don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands! Designed and hand-drawn by Swiss-Vietnamese illustrator Charlotte Broccard, it&#x27;s a lovely five minutes of fun.

                              <span>Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer sees a return for the fast-paced Hardcore mode from previous Call Of Duty games when Season 02 arrives on February 15th. Over the weekend, devs Infinity Ward tweeted about Hardcore mode’s imminent comeback in the forthcoming update. Hardcore mode chucks out the game’s HUD, turns on friendly fire, and reduces health to make matches quicker and a little more unpredictable. There&#x27;ll also be some changes to Warzone 2’s DMZ, such as new missions and difficulty tuning.

                              <span>It’s not even out yet, but we already know that the Dead Space remake launching on January 27th will have an alternate ending. A list of the game’s achievements published on True Trophies includes one that hints at another way to see out the revised adventures of Isaac Clarke, instead of just landing the bog-standard ending. Thankfully, there’s not much more info beyond its existence, so at least the extra ending isn’t ruined and you’ll be able to find out what it means for yourself.

Rockstar-focused Twitter account Tez2 highlighted the issue at the end of last week, before news of the situation spread onto the GTA Online subreddit. Rockstar Support hasn’t officially acknowledged any potential the exploits have to affect GTA Online players and their accounts, although Tez2 claimed that the company were already aware of what was going on.

                              <span>The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR has been delayed. 
PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn&#x27;t an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It&#x27;s a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…</span>

                              <span>Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that &quot;Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.&quot; What&#x27;s your favorite Life Is Strange game?

                              <span>World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.</span>

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She&#x27;s also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

                              <span>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company&#x27;s ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there&#x27;s no official indication that Halo Infinite&#x27;s course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend:

January 21, 2023
It&#x27;s a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE&#x27;s version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena&#x27;s career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back.

                              <span>Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it&#x27;s been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it&#x27;s clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward&#x27;s tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if &quot;no HUD&quot; is any indication, it&#x27;ll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

                              <span>343 Industries &quot;will continue to develop Halo now and in the future,&quot; says studio head Pierre Hintze. The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

                              <span>The original Granblue Fantasy was a JRPG mobile game only released in Japan, but that didn&#x27;t stop enterprising westerners going to the effort to play it. That&#x27;s mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is set in the same universe and has the same Final Fantasy vets involved, but it&#x27;s a big, splashly 1-4 player action RPG blockbuster, with combat reminiscent of some Platinum Games. You&#x27;ll find the latest trailer below.

That means it won&#x27;t receive any further new content, its final balance patch will be released on March 31st, and all other support and the sale of the game will cease on September 30th. Players who already own the game at that point will be able to continue playing in single- and multiplayer, for at least a while.

The boiler is gone in my house, so I&#x27;m wearing one of those giant hoodie things that comes down to my knees, and scuttle about the place secreting foodstuffs in the pouch. Wait, that&#x27;s more like a kangaroo, isn&#x27;t it. Curses! Regardless, I will only be able to warm my hands this weekend by cupping them over the light of my PC screen.

Banning domains that are removed or demoted by Google could be a good start, Corsearch notes.

Well, anyway, Haven Park is like A Short Hike crossed with Animal Crossing, and it&#x27;s currently free to keep from GOG.

                              <span>With all the Sad Dad™ games that have cropped up in recent years, many have rightfully been asking: &quot;Where are all the video game mums at?&quot;. Well, what if I told you that Swedish indie studio Might and Delight have been putting mums at the centre of their games since 2013? Yup, elephant mums in Shelter 3, Lynx mums in Shelter 2, and the OG badass badger mum in Shelter 1. Sure it’s kinda terrible that the only major rep mums are getting in video games is in the form of Might and Delight’s animal tales, but I’ll honestly take any story about motherhood I can get my paws on.
As much as I love Shelter 2 (less so Shelter 3, unfortunately), Shelter 1 holds a special place in my heart, mostly because no other animal-focused survival game has come even remotely close to claiming the coveted title of &quot;most brutal animal sim that made me ugly cry.&quot;

Both are free, although there’s not a suitably intimidating cult-related name for the latter yet. Relics Of The Old Faith was shown off a bit at the end of 2022, but this is the first we’re hearing of another arriving later in this sparkly new year.

                              <span>Despite the name, Sailing Era isn&#x27;t one of the sailing sims that have popped up recently. It&#x27;s a little hard to describe, but let&#x27;s see how we get on.
You steer your wee boat around a grounded anime age-of-sail Earth, looking for shipwrecks and treasures, fighting pirates (and possibly being one, although fairly peripherally),exploring, trading, and doing the usual Elite-style open world thing. I&#x27;ll be honest: I don&#x27;t exactly love this one, and it&#x27;s spread a little thin. But I&#x27;ve played it for hours longer than I expected and enjoyed it more as it went on. It&#x27;s doing a lot, in its own slightly roundabout way.

                              <span>Now that the Rockstar-embarrassing, staccato-titled Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition is out on Steam, this terrible trio of remasters has bailed out of Rockstar Store exclusivity and rolled into the speeding bumper of easy Steam Deck compatibility. I’ve spent this afternoon ambling around the redone GTA III, GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas, in handheld form, to confirm what you probably already know: they’re all still a bit crap.

                              <span>I’m a big fan of frogs in games. If I see a cute little green lad in a game, then I’m absolutely going to play it. This is how I started playing the free prologue demo for Die In The Dungeon, a turn-based roguelike where you place dice on a grid to slice and , er, dice your foes. It’s smart, concise, and I can’t stop playing.
Playing as your little green knight, you are given five dice each round to place on a game board. Each one represents a certain action, the basic ones being attacking and defending, but ramping up to mass healing and boosting the stats of other dice. Energy points dictate how many dice you can place on the board, with each one costing the number on its face. Placement is key, as different combinations can lead to better outcomes like, for example, how you can place an attack die in a space affected by a booster die to up its damage.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto Online’s been around for the best part of a decade, but you can now become a taxi driver at long last. You’ll probably need to do some light robbery to afford to buy a taxi from Warstock Cache &amp; Carry for the most authentic cab driver experience. Still, it’s relatively straightforward to start your latest, and uncharacteristically honest, money making venture. If you don’t have a taxi then you can still start taxi work jobs, and completing 10 in a row unlocks the cheaper trade price to nab a legit taxi. You can even call a cab from your iFruit phone to fast travel, if you don’t fancy driving your own.

                              <span>This past weekend, I ended an 18-month-long love affair. I managed to drag the experience out for all it was worth, but in the end, there was nothing to do but let go, and complete the fifth and final game in the Ace Attorney Turnabout Collection. And, oh, my heart, the post-game blues are real!
I was extremely late to the party when it comes to Capcom&#x27;s long-running series of legal dramedy visual novels, which debuted all the way back in 2001. But I found my way here in the end, largely thanks to the aforementioned collection, which packages prettied-up versions of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy and its prequel duology The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles onto modern systems.

Our fledgling protagonist, alone for the first time, has to fend for itself and find its way among the perilous mega-city ruins.  


If you engaged at all with the indie-game sphere in 2022, chances are this introduction rings a bell. Only it’s not a description of last year’s breakaway hit and multi-award winner, BlueTwelve Studio’s Stray, but an older and much more brutal feline saga, Videocult’s grim survival action game Rain World. The thematic overlap of these games, coupled with their contrasting design philosophies, provides an excellent springboard to reassess the latter – one of the most opaque, challenging, and underappreciated titles in recent memory, just in time for the arrival of its first official DLC, Rain World: Downpour.

Judging from the new trailer showing him in action that Firaxis have released, they seem to have struck a fine balance between comic book Deadpool and his movie counterpart. You can see Midnight Suns’ take on Wade Wilson in the trailer below.

                              <span>Rockstar have brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition to Steam more than a year after its disastrous launch. GTA Trilogy was originally released as a Rockstar Store exclusive, and packages together GTA III (the first 3D one), GTA: Vice City (the best one), and GTA: San Andreas (the one with CJ in it). The collection’s arrival on Steam replaces the original versions of each game on the storefront, and coincides with a publisher sale that ends February 2nd.

                              <span>Endless Dungeon is set within Amplitude&#x27;s Endless universe, but it&#x27;s neither a 4X strategy game like Endless Space nor a turn-based tactics game like sorta-predecessor Dungeon Of The Endless. It&#x27;s instead a co-op action roguelike, which takes the spaceship exploration and wave defense of Of The and makes it real-time, frantic, explosive.

It now has a release date, too: May 18th.

                              <span>I already spend a sizeable portion of my gaming time dying in roguelike platformers, and the Steam Deck has only made things worse. Now here comes DIG - Deep In Galaxies, a roguelike platformer that looks like a cross between Noita, Caveblazers and Broforce, with cosmic scale, destructible levels, double jump, a grappling hook and co-op. I&#x27;m powerless to resist.

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Riot Games have confirmed that they have laid off 46 staff. The news leaked out earlier today via esports report Jacob Wolf, who said that sources said cuts had been made across recruiting, human resources, support and esports teams. Riot then confirmed the cuts, saying that they had made &quot;implemented strategic shifts within a few teams to sharpen our focus in a number of areas.&quot;

Now Ubisoft say that they have cancelled it.

I was only sixteen when Remedy&#x27;s monologuing undercover DEA operative dropped into my life like a... well, a man diving sideways in slow motion with twin pistols blazing. It was that kind of time. The Wachowskis had, not too long before, left an indelible mark on cinema, and pop culture at large, with their stylish countercultural smash hit The Matrix. Dressing in a leather jacket while falling over and openly wielding automatic weaponry was legitimately cool, and not at all creepy. Why are you frowning like that, it&#x27;s almost like you don&#x27;t believe me.

The pocket pebble is only an emote that you can buy from the Sea Of Thieves store, but the company might help you keep it together on the long, lonely journeys across the game’s seas. The update also introduces a new time-limited event, The Secret Wilds, and some matchmaking improvements for PvP.

                              <span>There’s a lot I’m excited for in Tchia. Revealed at the Game Awards back in 2020, the trailer boasted a whole load of activities: sailing, climbing, ukelele playing, swimming, tree-hopping, slingshot sharpshooting, totem carving, gliding - the list is never ending - and all set on a beautiful island with characters to talk to, quests to complete, and enemies to fight. And on top of all that, you also have the ability to &quot;soul-jump&quot; letting you control any animal or object.
It sounds too good to be true, right? But two years after Awaceb&#x27;s trailer debut, I’ve gotten my hands on a preview build to see whether a nine-person dev team’s tropical island exploration game is pie in the sky. Turns out, it’s the opposite; my hands on time suggests Tchia will deliver on everything it promised and more.

                              <span>The CEO of Ubisoft has apologised to staff for comments he made in an email last week, which appeared to blame employees for cuts and delays at the publisher. Kotaku report that Yves Guillemot began a Q&amp;A meeting with an apology for his suggestion that sorting out issues at Ubisoft was the responsibility of lower-level staff, summarised by the phrase “the ball is in your court”. Guillemot had come under fire from Ubisoft staff following his comments, which prompted calls from one French union for Ubisoft Paris staff to strike later this month.

And that&#x27;s thanks to a new trailer where Kiryu/Ryoma drop (kicks) his bruising samurai lifestyle to the side for a simpler, purer existence: chopping spring onions to a rhythm in what looks to be an in-depth farming side activity.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced mass layoffs that will affect the developers behind Starfield, Halo Infinite, and Gears Of War. Bloomberg report that it’s not yet known what the scale of the job losses at Bethesda and 343 Industries will be, and Kotaku has also confirmed that The Coalition will also lose staff. Sources claim that some of the staff who’d lost their jobs at the affected studios were veterans who’d been with Microsoft for more than a decade. This layoff announcement from Microsoft has been made exactly a year after the company revealed they were buying Activision Blizzard.

                              <span>DDR5 RAM is steadily getting more affordable these days, and even surprisingly high-end 6000MT/s kits are going on sale. That&#x27;s the case today with this deal on a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from TeamGroup, specifically their T-Force Delta RGB RAM. It&#x27;s been reduced from its ridiculous launch MSRP of $339.99 down to $149.99, a great price for this spec and especially for a kit that comes equipped with RGB lighting. 
(If you&#x27;d prefer the same kit without RGB, then it can be yours for $133.)

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced).

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

                              <span>You may be able to hack your way across the Lands Between, but do you really know them? Can you tell your Nokrons from your Nokstellas? How about your Sanctums from your Catacombs? Can you distinguish between the Ainsel River and the Ainsel River Main? Look me in the eye and tell me you can pinpoint the Cathedral of Manus Celes, I dare you.
Alternatively, you can try out this fan-made Elden Ring Geoguessr-inspired game that plonks you into a random bit of the map and scores you based on how close you can drop a pin to your true location. If Rings aren&#x27;t your thing LostGamer.io has maps from other games, too, including Skyrim and Fortnite. It&#x27;s a lovely idea.

                              <span>I still say the Hylics games are some of the prettiest around, with their striking mix of claymation and video capture. So I&#x27;m delighted to realise that, unbeknowst to me, creator Mason Lindroth occasionally give behind-the-scenes peeks at props and animations on Twitter. It is very interesting to see those original handcrafted figures. And it is very funny to discover that the process of animating one character&#x27;s hands involved wearing a little cardboard green screen like a shroud while waggling a sexy gloved arm through the hole.

I played Returnal last year and can confirm that it is splendid, and also that you will grow to hate the kamikaze squid in the final area with every fibre of your being. Presuming you get that far.

                              <span>Far Cry 2 is a lot of things, based on the memories I have from playing it a decade ago. First and foremost, I recall Far Cry 2: Parasitic Pain, which tasks you with running around begging for pills to stave off a growing infection. Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It&#x27;s the best.

                              <span>The EU have voted to push for reform in the videogame industry, backing a report that takes aim at everything from loot boxes to human rights violations tied up with gold-farming. The report includes calls for better parental control options, &quot;harmonised rules&quot; compelling sellers to show more information about game content, and a clamp down on third-party skin gambling.
Those are all laudable goals, but time will tell how much change this actually amounts to.

For those among us with one of the brawnier graphics cards on the market, it’s just become even prettier too, via the slightly delayed implementation of ray tracing.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been holding something in for 5 years. It first started as a deep joy, like a ray of sunshine in the palm of my hand. Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I&#x27;d lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The &quot;it&quot; is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don&#x27;t laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I&#x27;ve actively obsessed over.
The game&#x27;s an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I&#x27;d finished all the stages. So, I thought, &quot;Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will&quot;. It still hasn&#x27;t happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can&#x27;t find anything else that&#x27;ll replace it.

Taking place at 9.30am PST / 5.30pm GMT, it&#x27;s not clear what the SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast will entail just yet, but given we already know several SteamWorld games are in development at the moment, here&#x27;s a rough guess-timate of what to expect.

In a motion to dismiss, EngineOwning reveals that Activision sued them in Germany over two years ago and the lawsuit is still ongoing.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting adventure is a short, cute, Zelda-in…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

The RIAA asked for $250,000 after winning its case against the YouTube ripper. However, according to Yout, a payment now would seriously harm its legal defense as funds are running low.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

                              <span>Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There&#x27;s a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won&#x27;t be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia&#x27;s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.</span>

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it&#x27;s looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That&#x27;s because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year&#x27;s House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon&#x27;s 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show&#x27;s gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
&quot;We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,&quot; CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. &quot;Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.&quot; 
&quot;Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,&quot; Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. &quot;We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.&quot; 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad&#x27;s start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a &quot;Battle Pass&quot; one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too.

&quot;You know how fuzzy memories can be.&quot; It&#x27;s a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece&#x27;s most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering &quot;what if…?&quot; scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…</span>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…</span>

                              <span>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they&#x27;ve mostly been broadcasted from streamers&#x27; homes. This year&#x27;s event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don&#x27;t expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it&#x27;s unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

The discussion is timely, though, as the big release of the week is One Piece Odyssey, Bandai Namco&#x27;s impressive RPG based on the popular anime. John Carson, who is reviewing the game for Game Informer, returns to talk about his experience and share his favorite games of 2022. We are also joined by former Game Informer editor and former host of this very podcast, Benjamin Reeves! Reeves makes his triumphant return to The Game Informer Show to also share his favorite games of 2022 and, alongside Wesley LeBlanc, reveal just how little they know about One Piece with our Devil Fruit quiz.

                              <span>Developer Scavengers Studio revealed last month that it was releasing Season: A Letter To The Future on January 31, and now, just a few weeks ahead of that, the studio has released a gorgeous new story trailer. 
This new trailer provides yet another beautiful glimpse into the painterly world of Season while providing new details about what our protagonist is doing: archiving the end of the Earth and the final people still living on it. She strives to capture their final moments in her journal and with her camera, aiming to learn why they&#x27;re still around and ultimately, what kept them going. It sounds like quite the emotional journey.

                              <span>Developer Motive Studio and publisher EA have released a new story trailer for its upcoming remake of Dead Space, and the game continues to look terrifying and beautiful. 
Due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this month on January 27, this might be one of our last looks at the remake before it&#x27;s in the hands of players. Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn&#x27;t changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). 
Check out the new Dead Space Remake &quot;Humanity Ends Here&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can&#x27;t wait to play it in just a few weeks.

Marvel Snap has been a resounding success since its release, allowing players to compete against other real-world players with a variety of cards, random locations, and more. Despite the positive reception, one thing players have been asking for has been missing: the ability to play against your friends. Developer Second Dinner announced in November that it was working on an update to allow friends to battle each other and now, it has announced that this update is expected at the end of the month. 
More specifically, the update is expected in a January 31 update, but Second Dinner says if it runs &quot;into any last minutes issues, we may choose to delay for a little longer t…</span>

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>Rejoice, for we are now in feature freeze for the 13.0 release series just in time for a new year! Some last minute features and fixed made it into the new year. Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles. On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces. Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up, and report any issues as normal! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
