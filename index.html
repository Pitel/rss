                              <span>Shmup fans are gonna be eating good this year, because Red Art Games kicked off its first Shmup Week event with two announcements. Both Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 and Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns Complete Collection are set to launch on Switch sometime in Q3 2024.


Bullet Hell Collection: Volume 1 includes Void Gore, Project Starship, and Z-WARP, all of which are on screen-filling display in the announcement trailer below.




In addition to the standard physical release, the first Bullet Hell Collection will be available in a Deluxe Edition that packs the games with one of three keychains, a poster, and reversible cover art. 




True to its title, Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns Complete Collection includes both Jets&#x27;n&#x27;Guns games by developer Rake in Grass (Rampage Knights, Silent Sector). Those who opt for all the bonuses will get the game along with a keychain, reversible cover, and a CD containing Machinae Supremacy&#x27;s original soundtrack. Like the standard versions, the Deluxe Editions of both games are priced at €39.99, but these are exclusively up for pre-order at the Red Art Games website. 


Here&#x27;s a look at both games in action:




Beyond that, it sounds like Shmup Week has some more surprises waiting in the wings. Red Art Games teased an announcement &quot;coming straight from Japan&quot; for Thursday, January 11 at 5:00 p.m. CET. There&#x27;s also the previously-delayed Shinorubi, which finally locked in a January 12 launch date from Red Art Games last month. That&#x27;s right around the corner digitally with a physical Switch release to follow at a later date.

                              <span>The PlayStation Blog revealed what PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra owners can add to their Game Catalog this month. Each of January&#x27;s offerings will be available to Extra and Premium subscribers as of January 16.


Sony is highlighting Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands as a stand-out this month. It&#x27;s a spin-off from Gearbox&#x27;s renowned Borderlands series. This time around, the looter-shooter leans into the tabletop inspirations set forth by past content like Borderlands 2&#x27;s Tiny Tina&#x27;s Assault on Dragon Keep. Chris Carter reviewed it at launch in March of 2022 and considered it &quot;great&quot;. 




Resident Evil 2 (also coming to Game Pass) is the second headliner this month. Capcom&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; remake of the iconic horror sequel wow-ed when it was released in 2019. I&#x27;d strongly recommend it if you&#x27;ve yet …</span>

The news, tweeted by Max and Naughty Dog, comes a day after Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever was cast as antagonist and dual protagonist Abby.




Creators Neil Druckmann and showrunner/director Craig Mazin confirmed Young Mazino&#x27;s casting via Variety, saying &quot;Young is one of those rare actors who is immediately undeniable the moment you see him. We’re so lucky to have him, and we can’t wait for the audience to see Young shine in our show.&quot;

                              <span>Amper Software, the team behind Team Fortress: Source 2, and James Lambert, the dev working on Portal 64, have stated that they’re ending development of their fan projects following cease and desist demands from Valve.


Team Fortress: Source 2 was a fan project aiming to port Valve’s 2007 multiplayer shooter, Team Fortress 2, over to the newer Source 2 engine. While the team had paused development in September, they were hoping to resume at some point, but the DMCA has made that pause permanent.


Meanwhile, Portal 64 is a project intended to demake 2007’s Portal to run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. Just a few days ago, the developer was celebrating the release of the game’s “First Slice,” which demonstrated the game&#x27;s progress.


The Team Fortress: Source 2 takedown seems rather understandable since Valve still supports Team Fortress 2 and may one day want to port it or create a sequel themselves. The DMCA posted on the public GitHub page cites that their reasons are due to Valve’s own assets being used in a project, though that hasn’t stopped some other fan games based on their properties from being published and even sold on Steam.


Meanwhile, James Lambert says that Valve has stated that they’ve requested Portal 64 to be taken down because “the project depends on Nintendo’s proprietary libraries.”


This is somewhat surprising since Valve has long supported fan endeavors based on their games, going as far as allowing them to be sold as retail products on Steam. Either this demonstrates a shift in the company’s policy toward such projects, or they actually have reasonable concerns toward these particular projects. Either way, it’s not a great look directly after their announced shift on their storefront policies in regards to AI.

What we know about Diablo 4 Season 3


A few days ago Diablo Community Developer Director Adam Fletcher indicated on Twitter that a new details on Season 3 will be shared in an upcoming Campfire Chat. Usually by now we at least know the overall theme and title of the season, such as Season of the Malignant or Season of Blood. But for now, all we know are a few new features coming to Season 3.


Since the release of Diablo 4, Season 3 has been the goal for when Leaderboards would be added to the ARPG. At BlizzCon 2023 a couple of months ago, Blizzard confirmed they would still be coming in Season 3. Other features teased at BlizzCon included a weekly challenge dungeon called The Gauntlet and something called the Hall of Ancients.


However, we&#x27;ve got absolutely no new information regarding the theme of Season 3 or its new mechanics, which is often what a new season is all about. Leaderboards will be great but more importantly, the season has to introduce some new features and mechanics that will convince me to go through the time-consuming process of leveling a character for the fourth time. With the new season coming in less than two weeks, surely we can expect more details soon.


Diablo 4 Season 3 starts on January 23.

                              <span>Valve has released updated guidelines on its policy regarding generative AI usage in games that will enable them “to release the vast majority of games that use it.”


Back in June, some developers reported that their submissions were rejected by Valve due to them containing AI-generated assets. Valve responded by stating that they were looking into the use of the technology, with the concern being that generative AI pulls from copyrighted material to create content.


Having considered the state of the technology, Valve has since amended its stance. Now, as part of the submission application for games, it states, “The survey now includes a new AI disclosure section, where you&#x27;ll need to describe how you are using AI in the development and execution of your game.” Valve categorizes AI use …</span>

                              <span>The graphics card wars seem to be kicking off again. Not only is AMD releasing the Radeon RX 7600 XT, but Nvidia recently announced three RTX 4000 series SUPER GPUs. Now, Team Green is trying to gain a slight advantage by offering a chance to win one of said cards.


You all know how this works by now. As outlined in a recent post on Twitter, if you want to be in with a chance of getting hold of an RTX 4080 SUPER (the Founder Edition specifically), you&#x27;ll need to comment with the relevant hashtag and like the Nvidia post.




Oh, also, it&#x27;s been signed by company CEO Jensen Huang. So...that&#x27;s a little something extra, I guess? The actual graphics card itself is due to release January 31, so Nvidia is evidently drumming up interest in this new variant of one of its most powerful Ada Lovelace products.


Or alternatively...


This competition comes as part of the tech giant&#x27;s appearance at CES 2024. As a result, if you happen to be at the event, you&#x27;ll have an additional chance at winning the new 4080. A post on the Nvidia website says the winner of the signed GPU will also receive $500 in Steam gift cards.


The sweepstakes runs between now and 5 pm PT on January 12, so you only have a couple of days to enter. Remember, if you&#x27;re at CES 2024, you can enter via Twitter and by visiting one of the event&#x27;s select booths.


The winners will be announced on February 29. Check the official rules for more details on how to enter.

                              <span>Fans with fond memories of gaming in the &#x27;90s (i.e. me) rejoice, as soon you&#x27;ll be able to play classic Sega Genesis games on the go. If you always wondered what it would be like to play Cool Spot on a train or ToeJam &amp; Earl while in a post office queue, well wonder no more.


As reported by The Verge, a company called Hyperkin – a specialist in console hardware and accessories – is working on a portable Sega Genesis device. Dubbed the Mega 95, the system is said to be compatible with the original cartridges.

The report goes on to say that it&#x27;ll feature a five-inch screen, the ability to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, up to 10 hours of battery life, and there&#x27;s even a USB-C dock so it can be hooked up to a TV.


Or Sonic the Hedgehog on an actual green hill


Taking a look at the images, we can see the Mega 95 dock has two controller ports, which resemble the serial connections from the OG Genesis (which we called the Mega Drive, here in the UK).


The fact that it&#x27;s meant to support the official cartridges will be a huge selling point from a nostalgia point of view. This means it&#x27;s probably not going to be using emulation, so you&#x27;ll get to relive the classics as they were intended, such as Streets of Rage 2, which we all know is the greatest game ever made (I will fight you over this).


At the moment, there&#x27;s no release date for the device. Nor is there a price. However, it is another means by which we can play our games on the go. Especially for those of us who miss the glory days of Sega, iconic Saturday morning cartoons, and highly flammable shell suits. God, I hate being old.

                              <span>Everyone knows by now that Forza Motorsport launched in a less-than-stellar state in October last year. Developer Turn 10 has since pulled up its sleeves in the interim, delivering a series of solid updates over the last few months, but the best is yet to come.


At the very least, that&#x27;s what Turn 10 itself claims in its latest development roundup. The studio is planning major revisions to three areas of Forza Motorsport&#x27;s gameplay: the car progression system, AI, and race regulations. These should be getting revamped &quot;in the coming months,&quot; though the extent of the changes isn&#x27;t clear.

                              <span>Turning 20 this year, Half-Life 2 is held aloft as one of the greatest first-person shooters ever made. While the 2004 game still holds up visually, a team of modders has been hard at work giving Valve&#x27;s classic a bit of a spit-shine.


At CES 2024, the Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project released a new trailer, showing the work that&#x27;s so far gone into the Nvidia-powered graphical improvement. In this instance, we get to see what Ravenholm looks like in all its shiny glory.




It&#x27;s an impressive mod, with the comparisons in the video showing the difference between the OG game and the RTX remix. We get a glimpse of all that lovely ray tracing, DLSS 3.5 image upscaling, and remastered assets. Ooh...ahh, etc.


Such moody lighting


Ravenholm is one of the most notorious sections in Half-Life 2. Something of a gear shift, this part of the story turns the game into a creepy horror that takes place in an abandoned mining town. It&#x27;s where we meet Father Grigori and also get to see the destructive power of the gravity gun when you add in a rusty saw blade.


As for when the RTX project will be available, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a release date yet. However, according to the Nvidia website, the open beta for the RTX Remix toolkit begins January 22. Maybe that&#x27;s when we&#x27;ll get to play it, or at least get an update on when this boosted version of HL2 will be available.


In the meantime, there&#x27;s Portal RTX to check out if you want to go &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot; at a different Valve game for a bit.

                              <span>After a nasty 2023 for games industry labor, 2024 is off to a similar start. We already saw significant layoffs at Twitch last year, and now there&#x27;s even more grim news ahead, as the Amazon-owned platform is letting 35% of its staff go.



A recent report from Bloomberg says Twitch is due to lose around 500 of its workforce. This news was originally sourced from people who are &quot;familiar with the plans.&quot;


Since this report, the company has issued a statement about the layoffs. A recent blog post acknowledges the &quot;difficult decision&quot; Twitch had to make, in which there will be a reduction in the &quot;size of our workforce.&quot; It also confirms the number of job losses will be 500.


Adding to this, CEO Dan Clancy says there will be a livestream going ahead on Thursday, January 11 at 1 pm PT for those who have questions. There&#x27;s also a section that addresses those who feel the decision will affect their role. Those who are not affected will still be sent an email from Clancy.




When will it end?


This also comes just shortly after Unity announced it was laying off 25% of its staff, which accounts for around 1,800 jobs. Indeed, this latest developer from Twitch could set another precedent – carrying on from 2023 – in terms of job uncertainty in the video game and adjacent industries.


We already experienced a ton of job losses last year, with thousands of employees being let go from otherwise lucrative development houses and publishers. Worse still, entire studios – such as TimeSplitters outlet Free Radical Design – had their doors closed for good.



We&#x27;re only into the second week of the new year, and things are not looking good for those employed in video games. This is all in spite of the fact that the industry at large saw rising profits in 2023, according to data from Statista. 


Hopefully, there&#x27;ll be something on the horizon quickly for the hundreds at Twitch that are affected by the decision.

                              <span>Though Helldivers 2 may be one of the lesser-known PlayStation exclusives slated for 2024, it certainly is one of the most interesting future releases. A cooperative objective-based shooter with a legacy to die for, Helldivers 2 won&#x27;t even be all that hard on our PCs, according to Sony.


As per Sony&#x27;s latest Helldivers 2 blog post, the game should be relatively easy to run on a very wide range of PC hardware. Thanks to its multiplayer focus and potentially some live-service leanings, Helldivers 2 will be released on PC and PS5 simultaneously with full cross-play support. Since Sony will be trying to build as big of a Helldivers 2 community as possible on February 8, the day of its release, it does make sense that the game wouldn&#x27;t target excessively strong hardware to begin with.

                              <span>Remember Suika Game? The charming puzzler blew up late last year thanks to its engrossing fruit-merging gameplay and colourful theme (and the help of a load of vtubers to boot). While the original was only on Nintendo Switch - although technically even that was a port of a game included on a projector, of all things - plenty of Suika clones quickly emerged to fill its watermelon-shaped hole on PC. The latest Suika-like is stepping things up another level by taking its chill combo-a-thon to a galactic scale with colliding planets and suns.

                              <span>Major actors’ union SAG-AFTRA have raised hackles among a number of voice game performers after striking a deal with a company that wants to create AI replicas of actors’ voices for use in games, among other things. While the union claim that their agreement with Replica will allow for a “fair” and “ethical” approach to creating AI voices, it’s clear that a number of actors with credits in games from Baldur’s Gate 3, Mortal Kombat and Starfield to Apex Legends, World of Warcraft and Genshin Impact don’t agree.

It&#x27;s £100 off today, making the price of admission to the really big monitor show just £699. For about twice the price of a good 1440p 165Hz monitor, you get a monitor the size of two 1440p 165Hz monitors - but, critically, with no gap in the middle.

Like, okay, Scorsese, you can say you didn&#x27;t really like Murder Mystery 2, the normies won&#x27;t chase you out of town with pitchforks. You know what actually is a burden? Your passions being watching hours of anti-multi-level marketing (MLM) YouTube videos, which is the content hole I fell down over the Christmas break. Your weird uncles have at least seen a film before, but it&#x27;s not like I can turn to my mum and ask her if she thinks the weird Monat Christians are worse than the Seint make-up TikTok girlies without explaining almost every word in the sentence.
Anyway. My point is: someone should make an MLM simulation game.

                              <span>In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. 


Warp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.

With that resolved, it&#x27;s time to get snarky. A real snark-off. So much snark, and so many snarks, and so much potential to be undone by the hubris of miscalculating snark.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t review Turn 10 and Microsoft&#x27;s latest Forza Motorsport and well, thank goodness, because I&#x27;ve just taken a look at the Steam page and it&#x27;s a regular six-mile pile-up in there. The game&#x27;s user reviews are Mostly Negative, three months after release, with complaints covering a wide gamut: the online being full of cheaters, the single player being boring, and the game being poorly optimised for PC.

                              <span>Little-known indie platform holder Valve have announced a new policy for Steam releases that make use of &quot;AI&quot; technology. To boil it down, developers will now have to disclose how they&#x27;re using AI tools on Steam pages, including what &quot;guardrails&quot; they&#x27;re putting in place for live-generated stuff that might be illegal or infringe on copyright. Valve are also introducing a new player reporting system for breaches. The company say these adjustments &quot;will enable us to release the vast majority of games that use AI&quot;, with the exception of Adult Only Sexual content that is generated live.

Players of the action-RPG/management hybrid on social media quickly did what people on social media do: demanded that they add sex. 

Its developers said they would and now we get to see what that means when the update launches on January 16th.

While these actions have an effect, they couldn&#x27;t prevent a resurgence in DMCA takedown notices over the past year. The search engine is now processing an average of 1.6 billion removal requests per year, mostly driven by publishers.

                              <span>Police in Vietnam say they have arrested three people behind at least three websites that offered pirated movies and anime content for online streaming. It&#x27;s claimed that the alleged 30-year-old ringleader launched the operation in 2019 and was assisted by people he recruited online. Action of this type is rare in Vietnam and may offer Hollywood a glimmer of hope that a wider crackdown sits somewhere on the horizon.

Update : Just a day before its expected release on 11th January 2024, publisher Headup has announced on Twitter that the Switch release of Laika: Aged Through Blood has been delayed.
The upcoming Motorvania, which launched on PC last year to very positive reviews, will be skidding onto the Switch eShop on a now-unspecified date. Headup has given a vague reason, saying that the team wants the game to be &quot;in the best possible shape&quot; for Switch.

Mojang has announced that support for Minecraft Legends, the RTS spin-off of the open-world block-building phenomenon, is ending after less than a year.
In a post shared on the official Minecraft website, senior creative writer Cristina Anderca shares details on the now &quot;final&quot; Lost Legends update, Snow vs Snouts. But later on in the post, the writer details just what&#x27;s happening with Minecraft Legends in the future, stating that the team at Blackbird Interactive is going to be taking &quot;a step back from development.&quot;

After a short delay, the latest UK boxed charts are now in and this week sees the return to a very familiar top three.
Hogwarts Legacy once again finds itself ahead of the pack, while last week&#x27;s silver medalist and Christmas number one (sort of), Super Mario Bros. Wonder, has dropped a place and now sits in second. This has left room for the old faithful EA Sports FC 24 to slide into the top rankings once again after briefly spending a week at number six.

For a while now, we (and, we presume, many of you) have been referring to Nintendo’s inevitable Switch successor as the ‘Switch 2.’ It makes sense for now, right? After all, rumours, speculation, and educated guesses are all loosely pointing to the new console being an iterative evolution of the hybrid concept that we’ve all come to know and love. If Nintendo were likely to deviate (and make no mistake, there’s no telling exactly what the firm is truly up to), we’d likely just stick with ‘the new console’ or ‘Nintendo’s next-gen system.’ For simplicity, and until we know otherwise, &#x27;Switch 2&#x27; will do.
Assuming that it will be the iterative evolution that we’re all hoping for, though, what will it actually be called? As a brand, the Switch is undoubtedly one of the most instantly recognised and understood names in the company&#x27;s history (certainly more so than ‘Wii U’, anyway), so it’s reasonable to assume that Nintendo probably won’t ditch the Switch branding.

Here&#x27;s a little fact that made us choke on our Cornflakes this morning, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is old. Okay, maybe not old-old, but older than the original N64 release was back in 2011.
Yes, the time between today (10th January 2024) and the release of OOT 3D (16th June 2011) is now one day longer than the time between the N64 original (21st November 1998 in Japan) and the 3DS remake. Or, as @SapphireSenatrx nicely worded it on Twitter, &quot;Ocarina of Time 3D is now as old as Ocarina of Time was when they made Ocarina of Time 3D&quot;.

                              <span>What have you got, 2024?
Nintendo shares have hit a record high of 7,823 yen (roughly $54.14) as of Wednesday, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.

                              <span>Naughty Dog and HBO have cast Young Mazino as Jesse for The Last of Us&#x27; second season. This follows yesterday&#x27;s news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show&#x27;s second season. 
For the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix&#x27;s Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for &quot;Snooze&quot; by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity&#x27;s Triump, and Good Boy. 
We&#x27;re so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU
January 10, 2024
Fans of Naughty Dog&#x27;s Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.
We loved the first season and can&#x27;t wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren&#x27;t alone either – The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was HBO&#x27;s second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. 
The first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.

                              <span>The 1992 Alone in the Dark served as major inspiration to the original Resident Evil, which received a sequel, which was successfully remade as a third-person shooter 20 years later, which in turn has presumably inspired Alone in the Dark&#x27;s upcoming remake, which is releasing March 2024. It&#x27;s a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.
Join Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark&#x27;s chance to shine. For more on the Alone in the Dark remake, head here for a big preview.

The company announced these layoffs in an internal memo sent out on Monday, January 8. These job cuts follow a turbulent 2023 for the company after it attempted to introduce per-install fees to developers using its game engine before later walking it back. 
Unity is expected to lay off 1800 people by the end of March and once complete, it will be the company&#x27;s largest round of layoffs ever. It will be its fourth round of layoffs since July 2022, as noted by Yahoo! Finance. The job cuts are expected to affect all departments at Unity.

Unfortunately, it seems this heartbreaking trend is continuing into this new year as yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Amazon-owned streaming company Twitch is set to lay off 500 employees, or about 35 percent of its staff. 
These layoffs follow two rounds of layoffs Twitch experienced last year. Bloomberg expects the layoffs to be announced today. As for why, the publication says running Twitch is extremely expensive and the company has struggled to financially get on top of the cost to support billions of hours of livestreamed content.

Reasons why included a desire for better wages, increased safety precautions, and protections around exploitative uses of artificial intelligence. Now, just a few months later, SAG-AFTRA has signed an agreement with Replica Studios, an A.I. voice technology company, to allow game developers to use A.I. voices, as reported by Game Developer. 
Various video game voice actors, like Yong Yea, the new English voice of Kazuma Kiryu in the Like a Dragon series, have publicly stated that they and other actors they know were not aware of this. &quot;Every voice actor I know not only didn&#x27;t approve this,&quot; Yea writes in a tweet. &quot;[They] pretty much heard about this for the first time today on Twitter.&quot;

Now it&#x27;s taking the bold step of moving beyond meme by becoming a playable video game, when it launches on January 19th.

                              <span>When the Ryzen 9 5950X debuted in 2020, it was a staggeringly strong productivity and gaming CPU, with 16 cores and 32 threads of Zen 3 power for a princely £750. A little over three years later and next-gen Zen 4 CPUs are firmly here, but the 5950X remains the most powerful productivity CPU for the venerable AM4 platform. 
That makes the 5950X a tempting upgrade option for anyone using an older Ryzen processor that wants to keep using their existing motherboard and RAM, and today this CPU has breached a new low-water mark: £360 on Amazon UK, 52% off its original recommended retail price. (It&#x27;s also a nearly-as-good 50% off at the US.)

                              <span>I will not lie to you, reader, I used up about 95% of today&#x27;s remaining creative energy/caffeine on that headline joke, but let&#x27;s charge our flashlights, sharpen our hooks and struggle on through the body copy anyway. Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake is joining Behaviour Interactive&#x27;s Dead By Daylight as a playable Survivor, having been conjured from his writing desk by the latter game&#x27;s villainous Entity.
Mind you, I&#x27;m a little unclear on the causality here. The press release includes a cheeky quote from a lost Alan Wake manuscript in which the perennially troubled horror author suggests that he is the creator of Dead By Daylight&#x27;s universe, not Behaviour Interactive. &quot;As I searched for a way out, memories of a script I wrote for Night Springs about a fog-engulfed place flooded back,&quot; it reads. &quot;Surrounded by the same fog, I became a pawn - trapped. I must find a way out. Rewriting that script is key.&quot; Oh Alan. Have you tried laying off the coffee and going for a stroll, now and then?

                              <span>Corsair&#x27;s RM1000x Shift power supply is quite a tempting one for any PC build, providing 1000W of power at 80+ Gold efficiency - but the best feature here is its conveniently reachable side-mounted connector placement. Corsair charges a premium for this feature, with the PSU normally going for £160, but today you can pick up a refurbished unit from Scan in the UK for just £110. That&#x27;s a sizeable savings and well worth considering.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever been to Shinjuku station in Japan, you know what it&#x27;s like to be transported to a dizzying realm of limbs and tickets and signage with myriad squiggly lines that make about as much sense as rainbow spaghetti that&#x27;s been hurled at a white rectangle. You, quite literally, need to plunge yourself into an entire city within a city to get from one place to another.
Surface from the chaos, though, and it can feel like quite the achievement. Small horror game The Exit 8 captures this sense of elation perfectly, as well as all the subtleties that come from navigating a crash of noise. I&#x27;d say it will make for an initially cursed start to your 2024 endeavours, with the promise of a big reward at the end if you can stomach it.

                              <span>Acts! It used to be just those old-timey theatre productions that had them, but as in many other respects, videogames have nipped through a stage exit and stolen theatre&#x27;s underpants. One act isn&#x27;t the same as another, however: take the third act of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which many players feel isn&#x27;t a patch, or indeed a hotfix changelog, on the thunderously well-received RPG&#x27;s first two acts. According to senior RPG designer Anna Guxens, Larian have been following the reaction and are thinking about how they can handle the third act&#x27;s &quot;drastic&quot; tone shift better in future releases. It&#x27;s a timely observation, because in separate news, Larian&#x27;s CEO Swen Vincke has posted that he&#x27;s &quot;figured out&quot; the first act of Larian&#x27;s next unannounced project.

                              <span>It’s been a good handful of years for fans of secret-ridden games. The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.
What best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon&#x27;s secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.

                              <span>I have a sneaking affection for slightly jarring genre hybrids - games like the relatively recent Disintegration and the much older Battlezone 2, which smush action mechanics together with real-time strategy, or the rather more elegant Puzzle Quest, in which you roll around a parchment landscape fighting wizards using the power of match-3. New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.
You&#x27;ll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times. Bump into a foe, however, and your first-person perspective undergoes a fission reaction, splitting into a full group of warriors who are controlled in top down.

                              <span>MSI are the latest gaming gear makers to unveil a Steam Deck-alike, announcing the Claw as part of their CES 2024 showcase. The Claw – great name, by the way – actually looks and sounds closer to the Asus ROG Ally than Valve’s handheld, being a Windows 11-based device without any flashy hardware tricks like the Lenovo Legion Go’s detachable controllers. All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.

                              <span>Portal 2 was released in 2011 to widespread acclaim. Now, 22 years later, there’s a free fan-made mod called Portal: Revolution that perfectly re-captures the joy of the game, albeit with the sad omission of a much-loved character.


Released on January 6 2024, Portal: Revolution—developed by Second Face Software—has received positive reviews on Steam. Over 3,000 people have reviewed the mod at the time of this writing, and 94% of those are positive. 


One of the reviewers on Steam likened it to the scene in Ratatouille where the chef eats something made by the rat and has a flashback to a heartwarming childhood memory. They’re right, too.

The game add-on offers eight hours of exclusive gameplay, voice acting that perfectly captures the humor of the original game and challenging levels to work through. Promising to pick up in terms of difficulty where the original Portal 2 left off, there really is some challenge to work through.


Sadly, the add-on takes place after the demise of GLaDOS, so we’re without her dark sense of humor. But with so much on offer, we can’t hold that against the developers. 


As well as taking the difficulty of puzzles up a notch, the developers have also introduced some new elements to gameplay. There’s a new variant of laser cube and field that cleanses gel. Second Face Software have also resurrected a feature that was removed during development of the original Portal 2: &quot;Pneumatic Diversity Vents.&quot;

Portal: Revolution is available now on Steam for free and you can play it as long as you have a copy of Portal 2 downloaded to your steam account.

                              <span>Announced at CES, Hyperkin has revealed the next in their line of retro Xbox controllers for modern hardware. This time around they’ll be recreating the form factor of the Xbox Controller S, which was the revision of the original Xbox’s rather beefy handpiece.


The original controller that shipped with the OG Xbox was rather divisive. It was rather bulky and rather unwieldy, even if you had big hands. This was apparently due to difficulties with the manufacturer of the controller’s PCB, but most players at the time only saw a giant controller where most of the facial real estate was taken up by a humungous logo. The controller was nicknamed “The Duke” (I actually remember hearing this moniker during the console’s lifespan) and was eventually replaced by the less massive Controller S. Apparently, some people have some love for the original monstrosity since Hyperkin recreated that one first, followed by the Xbox 360&#x27;s controller.


Hyperkin’s new creation, cleverly named DuchesS, is made to work with PC and Xbox Series X|S. It has modern features like a share button and a headphone jack. Perhaps most importantly, it uses Hall Effect joysticks and analog triggers. The early images shared by Hyperkin show off white and black variations. Unfortunately, there hasn’t yet been a translucent “crystal” version announced.


I don’t have a tremendous amount of nostalgia for the Controller S, but I always love seeing retro controller recreations. I’ve certainly got enough based on the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive lying around. I think if I had one wish for the controller, it would be that it could work with the OG Xbox. I always appreciate fancier controllers for old hardware.


There is no release date or price stated for the Hyperkin DuchesS.

                              <span>Bandai Namco just released a very special five-minute recap of the history of the Mishima clan, to hype us up for Tekken 8&#x27;s release on January 26. And it&#x27;s narrated by none other than Succession&#x27;s own Brian Cox.




What&#x27;s so special about Brian Cox narrating Tekken?


Any recap would be more than welcome at this point. Some Tekken fans weren&#x27;t even alive when the OG Tekken came out, and the plotline gets highly convoluted sometimes, but the extra layer of awesome here is the presence of Brian Cox.


So what about it? You might think this is yet another out-of-touch promo by a Hollywood actor whose only knowledge of the game comes from the teleprompter sitting right in front of him. Half of that is likely true, as I doubt Brian Cox knows what a Korean Backdash is, but he has a surprising …</span>

The Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, is fresh off eight Creative Emmy wins and is nominated for five main Primetime Emmy awards, including Best Drama. The show was a massive hit for HBO and fans alike.

                              <span>PlayStation 5 owners are one of the few who have yet to be able to get their hands on Sam Barlow&#x27;s interactive movie title, Immortality. But their wait is finally over, as Immortality splices onto PS5 on January 23.


The news came within an announcement trailer from Barlow&#x27;s Half Mermaid Productions. The trailer gives a brief idea of how the game&#x27;s unique &quot;match cut&quot; feature works and teases the project&#x27;s supernatural story.




Initially released for PC and Xbox Series X|S in August 2022, Immortality was met with glowing reviews from many outlets. Destructoid&#x27;s Eric Van Allen classified it as &quot;superb&quot; in our review. 


Immortality&#x27;s story revolves around the actress Marissa Marcel and the three films she starred in but were never released. The player uses behind-the-scene footage to jump between movies, matching shots of faces or objects to jump to a similar take in a different film. The more you interact with the game&#x27;s clips, the more you begin to unravel and understand the title&#x27;s dark and mysterious plot.


Outside of reviews, Immortality also cleaned up during award season. The project was nominated across numerous outlets for Best Performance, Best Story, Best Game Direction, and Best Game. Manon Gage, the lead actress who portrayed Marissa Marcel, came home with hardware at the 2022 Golden Joystick Awards for Best Performer. Gage also won the 2022 New York Game Award for Best Acting in a Game.


PlayStation 5 owners should be excited to have such a unique title become part of the console&#x27;s catalog when Immortality launches on PlayStation 5 on January 23. Immortality is currently playable on PC, Xbox Series X|S, mobile, and Mac.

                              <span>Pocketpair has announced the date for the Early Access release of Palworld – the legally distinct Pokémon game with guns. It will launch on January 19. Accompanying the announcement is a new trailer.


Palworld is an open-world crafting survival game that features monsters extremely reminiscent of Nintendo’s Pokémon series. The twist is that rather than tame them through friendship, you blast them with an array of firepower. You’ll also need to do some base building to keep your Pals a place to eat and rest.




The trailer shows off some other… uh, trainers, who wield some legally distinct Pokeballs. Palworld allows for up to 32 players. PVP battles are planned but won’t be in the initial Early Access launch.


The derivative nature of Palworld’s concept sort of undermines the weirdness of it. However, I have to admit that recent looks into it have looked pretty fun. With something like this, I’d almost expect the devs to quickly spit something out to capitalize on the novelty of the concept, but that doesn’t look like what’s going on here. The developer seems to be taking their time in developing it.


On the other hand, Pocketpair doesn’t exactly have the best track record, but that’s not always the whole story. I’m at least curious enough to try it.


Palworld launches into Early Access on PC January 19, 2024.

                              <span>We&#x27;re just past the first week of the new year and it&#x27;s all hands on deck for rivals Nvidia and AMD. With the former announcing three new RTX 4000 SUPER graphics cards, the latter was quick to unveil a boosted version of one of its current gen products.


Announced at CES 2024, AMD is launching the Radeon RX 7600 XT, a somewhat enhanced version of the 7600 that released last May. While it&#x27;s admittedly at the lower end of the 7000 series, the XT variant does offer 16 GM of VRAM, double what the non-XT version has.




This sort of puts it on par with the likes of the 7800 XT and 7900 GRE, but only in terms of memory size. However, this does mean it will at least be a cheaper choice than the more enthusiast models, starting at $329.


Higher clock speeds as well


The double RAM is probably the biggest draw of the RX 7600 XT, but it offers other spec improvements as well. For example, it features boost clock speeds of up to 2755 MHz against the regular 7600&#x27;s 2655 MHz.


The newer model will also have 22.57 TFLOPS. Compared to its predecessor&#x27;s 21.75, it&#x27;s another bit of extra juice for the XT variant.


Outside that, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a huge performance difference between the two. It&#x27;s also said to use a bit more power, with a TDP of 190W (versus 165W). However, what you can expect is the RX 7600 XT to be available from January 24. If you are interested in it, that is.

                              <span>Behaviour Interactive is keeping the Dead by Daylight crossover train chugging with DLC based on 2024’s winner of some awards, Alan Wake 2. The eponymous wordsmith will be joining the game as a survivor.


Dead by Daylight was released back in 2016, and since then, it’s been piling on the crossover content. By now, they must be running out of things to crossover with. Recently, they introduced a survivor DLC that is just Nicholas Cage. Like, just the dude with a few different jackets. Eventually, maybe we’ll just be getting various unrelated celebrities. Orson Welles, perhaps? Columbo?




But for now, Alan Wake is a pretty decent fit. The tormented writer is no stranger to horror and, when he’s not at a typewriter, spends much of his time under duress. The trailer shows how he gets tied into the slasher playground of Dead by Daylight. By writing, of course. Live by the pen, die by the pen.


If you’re not familiar, Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where up to four players take the role of the survivors trying to escape, and one person is a slasher trying to carve them up. It has previously crossed over with properties like Alien, Silent Hill, and A Nightmare on Elm Street.


Alan will first be available on Dead by Daylight&#x27;s Public Test Build starting on January 10 at 11am EST. He’ll then be released for purchase on January 30.

                              <span>Literally a few days ago, there were heavy rumors and leaks suggesting MSI was about to unveil its own Steam Deck rival. Low and behold, it turned out to be true. Say hello to &quot;The Claw,&quot; a gaming device from the laptop manufacturer that&#x27;s gunning for a slice of the handheld PC pie.


MSI announced the item at CES 2024, with an expected release date around the first quarter of this year. We&#x27;ve already seen that companies such as ASUS and Lenovo can take on the Steam Deck, so perhaps there is more room for another competitor.




As for what The Claw will be packing, details on the MSI website show it&#x27;ll feature an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, along with an Intel Arc graphics chip. This is something of a departure, as the aforementioned alternatives (as well as the Deck) have opted for AMD architecture instead.


Get a grip!


So how does it stack up against the Steam Deck? With a brand-new Intel processor compared to the Zen 2 – which launched in 2019 – we can expect The Claw to offer something a little nipper with its more up-to-date guts.


It also boasts a 1920x1080 touchscreen and a 52Whr battery life. Compared to the Deck&#x27;s 1200x800 screen and 50Whr battery, the former could have a bit of an edge over the latter.


However, with it running Windows 11, it could have a less intuitive mobile gaming operating system than SteamOS, which is specifically built to play games from a user&#x27;s Steam library.


Only time will tell how it&#x27;ll fare against Valve&#x27;s OG offering, but it definitely looks like things are beginning to get crowded in the portable PC sphere.

                              <span>Microsoft is ready to get 2024 rolling. The company has announced that it will host an Xbox Developer Direct on January 18.


Xbox teased several of the projects that we&#x27;ll be seeing during the January 18 Developer Direct. Amongst them are Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s Avowed, MachineGames&#x27; Indiana Jones title, and Ninja Theory&#x27;s Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.




The Xbox Wire shed a few more details on what to expect from the event, including our first real look at Indiana Jones. The Developer Direct will spend about 10 minutes on the project, which includes the first gameplay trailer and details on the title&#x27;s setting and story.


There weren&#x27;t really any details given for Hellblade 2&#x27;s segment. Instead, the Xbox Wire says to expect a behind-the-scenes look at the game courtesy of Ninja Theory. We last saw the title at The Game Awards within an impressive new trailer and a release window confirmed for this year.


Avowed is getting a &quot;deep dive into the gameplay experience&quot; from Obsidian Entertainment. The studio will detail the game&#x27;s Living Lands and the action RPG&#x27;s &quot;deep themes, dynamic gameplay, and thoughtful reactivity.&quot;


Also at the Developer Direct will be Oxide Games&#x27; Ara: History Untold. We&#x27;ll get a new look at gameplay and features from the history strategy game crafted by veteran developers of the Civilization series. 


Xbox also notes that there will be a standalone presentation from Zenimax Online Studios following the Developer Direct. Here you can expect details on The Elder Scrolls Online&#x27;s 2024 roadmap, including a new zone, storyline, and gameplay features. 


The Xbox Developer Direct will stream on Xbox channels on Thursday, January 18 at 12:00 p.m. PST, 3:00 p.m. EST.

                              <span>It feels like Destiny 2 and Bungie are going through a never-ending torrent of struggles as of late, ranging in severity from downright catastrophic to mildly annoying. Somewhere closer to the annoying side of the scales falls the recent Checkmate PvP mode issues, which Bungie is now trying to alleviate.


Notably, Bungie admitted in mid-December its relatively newfangled Checkmate multiplayer mode didn&#x27;t quite pan out. The community was so unhappy with it, in fact, that Bungie updated PvP to allow players to choose between Checkmate and the regular Control modes, which was a reasonably timely bandaid in its own right. Now, however, a new series of changes is coming to Checkmate, which may well be what the mode needed in the first place.

                              <span>Unity is starting the new year with a sizeable round of layoffs. According to Reuters, the company plans to ax 25% of its workforce, about 1,800 employees. 


The layoffs are expected to be completed by March 2024 and it will affect all teams and areas of the business. The internal company memo states that this is being done as Unity &quot;restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth.&quot; 


At present, the company cannot determine what the related costs and charges will be though &quot;charges will primarily relate to employee transition, severance payments, and employee benefits.&quot; There has also been no word on what structural changes, though a company spokesperson confirmed that they are coming, Reuters reports. 


These layoffs come after Unity faced great controversy in 2023 following the announcement of &quot;runtime fees&quot; for developers. Plans for these additional fees have continued, and CEO James Whitehurst states it is expected that the impact of this business model change will have &quot;minimal benefit in 2024 and ramp from there as customers adopt our new releases.&quot;


Last year, the gaming industry witnessed waves of layoffs striking several companies. It appears the trend is far from over, with Unity&#x27;s massive layoffs bringing a bad start to the year. VR studio Archiact has also already announced layoffs in 2024.

                              <span>Stephanie Tyler Jones, who provided the face likeness for Mary Jane Watson in Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, is speaking out about fans who have &quot;crossed boundaries&quot; over the character.


As she explains in an Instagram message, she appreciates the positive responses she&#x27;s received over the years. However, certain fans have crossed the line, with some going so far as to call her workplace and attempt to speak to her. 


Upon hearing all the voicemails, she &quot;immediately felt unsafe and uncomfortable.&quot; Though it should need no explaining, she highlights that while she may be the face behind a cultural icon, she is still &quot;a human being trying to make a living just like you.&quot;


She also highlights that her skincare page isn&#x27;t for Spider-Man or MJ fans. She asks fans to not cross boundaries, informs everyone that messages will not be answered, and you can expect to be blocked if she feels uncomfortable. 


It&#x27;s worth noting that she had no longer been an actively auditioning actor or model before the incident. The roles she accepts are only creative outlets for herself and with friends. 


Jones joins an unfortunately long list of actors who have found themselves harassed following their gaming fame. This includes Laura Bailey who received threats towards her and her family after her performance as Abby in The Last of Us Part 2.

                              <span>Over the years, the Resident Evil series has become famous for more than its horror elements. From Chris Redfield punching a boulder to the cheesy voice acting in the original games, these moments are iconic in their own right. But the one that older fans will know and love is the infamous &quot;Jill sandwich&quot; line.


Now, that has pretty much become a reality, thanks to user tombraidermods. Essentially, their mod allows you to play the original Resident Evil game as Jill, only now she&#x27;s decked out to look like a giant sandwich, thus fulfilling Barry&#x27;s prophecy.

It doesn&#x27;t get much Jill-Sandwich-ier than this. Nothing else seems to change about the game, other than putting the STARS agent in between two slices of bread.


What? No lettuce?


Maybe this needs a little bit of explanation for those who don&#x27;t get the reference. See, in the first installment of Resident Evil, Jill Valentine is almost crushed by a slow-falling ceiling. However, she&#x27;s saved at the last second by her colleague Barry Burton.


Upon rescuing her from what would almost certainly be a horrifying death, Barry flippantly says that she almost became a &quot;Jill sandwich.&quot; Much mirth is had by both the zombie-shooting agents.


Okay, maybe you had to be there. The point is, this mod turns that one, classic line into something literal. It&#x27;s hard to say whether being wedged between two large slices of white makes taking on the hordes of undead cumbersome, but at least it gives the zombies something to much on that isn&#x27;t Jill&#x27;s brains.

                              <span>I talk about this all the time, but I’ve long been searching for the perfect road trip game. Something that captures the calmness of a long drive and the vibes of a late-night Waffle House. One day. One day…


It’s that search that got me interested in Pacific Drive. Okay, it’s sort of like driving a jalopy through the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, as shown in S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but there’s still room for Waffle House vibes. Having played a bit of it, I’m going to have to say that I’m probably going to still be left searching, but that’s not to say that Pacific Drive doesn’t have some interesting things going for it.

                              <span>When navigating the squalid wastelands of video games, I often must turn to reputation to figure out where to stick my fingers. In the West, few games have a reputation for being awful quite like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.


This is entirely because of the Angry Video Game Nerd, who I respect but isn’t always the best source since he’s primarily aimed at providing entertainment through a schtick. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has been singled out by him as one of the darkest spots in the NES library. I have to disagree.


Oh, it’s definitely awful. Don’t assume that I’m here to defend it. It’s as boring as a lecture on the history of terrycloth (did you know it dates back to before 4000 BCE?) and as tedious as chewing through a concrete brick. However, what you might not expect is that, when exami…</span>

Stop right there! We know what you&#x27;re thinking. You&#x27;re expecting a long list of games that we wish we had never played. The stinkers that took up 20 hours we&#x27;ll never get back. Well, you&#x27;re wrong!
We are not about to be a negative Nancy and dunk on some bad games just because we wish we could wipe them from our minds. This is about positively forgetting games.

We&#x27;re not far off from our first Switch-exclusive release of 2024, and ahead of the big day, Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Another Code: Recollection.
This upcoming remake of the DS and Wii cult classics — Another Code: Two Memories (Trace Memory in the US) and Another Code: R – A Journey into Lost Memories — completely recreates the two games with a beautiful new visual style, new cutscenes, and a reworked script.

Hilltop Studios has announced that the narrative deduction adventure game Lil&#x27; Guardsman will be pointing and clicking its way onto the Switch eShop on 23rd January.
This one will see you playing as Lil, a 12-year-old who is stepping in for her Dad as a castle gate guardsman. During your shifts, you will interrogate anyone who attempts to enter including goblins, dragon slayers and... the Ghostbusters? before deciding whether to grant them access or not. Oh, and there also seems to be a war raging in the background. That sounds important.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom can be pretty tough at times; wouldn&#x27;t it be great if you could just wipe out any enemy in just one hit? Hmm... We personally enjoy the challenge, but for those out there who might want a bit of a helping hand, Gaming Reinvented has laid out a new glitch that effectively removes any challenge from combat encounters.
To accomplish the glitch, you&#x27;ll need three things: a weapon (ideally one with reasonably good durability), at least one memory, and an unwilling participant in the form of a Bokoblin, Lynel, Gleeok, or whatever else you fancy murdering... you heathen.

Whether you agree with the form or not, a live-action Zelda movie is in the works at Nintendo. What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s being produced by none other than Sony Pictures. Yes, Sony. The PlayStation guys. Nintendo was the first to mention the project&#x27;s existence, but now it&#x27;s the time for the co-producers to drum up some hype and Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida is doing exactly that. Well, kind of.
At yesterday&#x27;s Sony CES 2024 press conference, Yoshida gave a rundown of all of the film and TV projects that the company&#x27;s Pictures arm is currently handling, which meant that Zelda had to get a shoutout. And a shoutout it got. Yes, according to the Sony CEO, The Legend of Zelda movie will deliver — are you ready for this? — &quot;an amazing tale of adventure and discovery.&quot; Try to contain your surprise as you lift your jaw up from the floor.

                              <span>Collection launches Valentine&#x27;s Day.
Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is right around the corner, launching on February 14th, 2024, but fans are eager to see more from the upcoming collection before its release.
As spotted by our friends over at Push Square, the official Tomb Raider X account has stated &quot;We&#x27;ll have plenty more to share soon&quot; after a fan requested more images and gameplay videos. And yes, we&#x27;ve not really seen anything since the game&#x27;s initial reveal, but gosh, it was only announced in September.

Last year, the video game software provider Unity copped a lot of backlash when it announced plans to impose a &quot;runtime fee&quot; pricing policy. Now, following the departure of the CEO and president, the latest update reveals Unity will cut &quot;25% of its workforce, or 1,800 jobs&quot;.
This information was revealed in a regulatory filing and internal memo earlier this week. It will reportedly be the software provider&#x27;s &quot;largest layoff ever&quot; with the whole process expected to be completed &quot;by the end of March&quot;.

If you&#x27;re looking for another GoldenEye 007-style game to play on the Nintendo Switch, you might want to check out The spy who shot me, which arrived on the eShop last week for just $7.99 / £7.19.
It&#x27;s a parody of James Bond-inspired and the &quot;classic shooters&quot; of the &#x27;90s. While the obvious comparison is Rare&#x27;s legendary N64 title, some reviews on Steam also compare it to series like No One Lives Forever. It&#x27;s been available on Valve&#x27;s digital service since 2019 and has a &quot;very positive&quot; review rating overall.

                              <span>Kaitlyn Dever has been officially announced as The Last of Us TV adaptation&#x27;s Abby. Kaitlyn Dever is perhaps best known for her role in 2019&#x27;s Booksmart, but video game fans may know her best as the voice of Cassie Drake, seen at the end of Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End. Dever was also an early fan cast for the role of Ellie when casting rumors for The Last of Us TV show first began swirling. She also reportedly read for the role of Ellie before it ultimately went to Bella Ramsey.
We&#x27;re thrilled that Kaitlyn Dever is joining @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2 as Abby!

January 9, 2024
Abby is a crucial character from The Last of Us Part II, but to say much more than that would spoil major elements of the plot that it&#x27;s fair to assume many TV viewers are not yet aware of. How Dever will differentiate from the video game version of Abby, performed by Laura Bailey (who had a cameo in the first season of the show as a nurse), remains to be seen.
Despite the second season of the show likely not airing until 2025, The Last of Us has already had a strong 2024, raking in eight Emmy awards. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Developer Direct next Thursday, January 18. The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.
The Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. 
Indiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game&#x27;s story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory&#x27;s Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It&#x27;s unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.
Microsoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. 
The Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.
Xbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. 
Ara: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.</span>

                              <span>Sam Barlow’s acclaimed interactive cinematic mystery game Immortality is making its way to PlayStation 5 on January 23. The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.
Like Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. 
Learning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.


Immortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.</span>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League exists at a strange intersection of gaming hype. On the one hand, obviously, we are and should be excited for Rocksteady&#x27;s return to the Arkham Universe that it popularized through some of the greatest superhero games of all time. Obviously. But on the other hand, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deviates from so many of the conventions that made Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight so beloved. And so many of those conventions that Kill the Justice League embraces – such as a team-based, co-op inf…</span>

                              <span>As soon as Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s new Pictomancer job was revealed during Tokyo Fan Festival, Eorzeans across social media immediately utilized their own artistic talents to honor the game&#x27;s next magic user. No announcement would be complete without its fair share of memes, so here&#x27;s a few of the finest we&#x27;ve found.


For those out of the loop, Pictomancer is the second job announced for FFXIV&#x27;s upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Seemingly based on Final Fantasy 6&#x27;s Relm Arrowny, the new footage of the game showed how the Pictomancer will use the power of art to inflict damage. So, naturally, Pictomancer garnered a plethora of memes exploring the implications of life as a full-time artist. These range from wholesome homages to Bob Ross to... decidedly less wholesome ideas.

                              <span>Among the slew of reveals for Final Fantasy XIV during Fan Fest Tokyo last weekend was a new town players will visit during upcoming expansion Dawntrail. While a new corner of Eorzea to explore is exciting by itself, the cyberpunk city has added to my hope that the MMO is set to shower a bit more love on the best Final Fantasy game. That’s right: Final Fantasy IX.

                              <span>If you’re like me, you probably have at least one treasured memory of being allowed to play an edutainment game at school under the guise of learning. What a blast, getting to play video games at school! For me, it was a floppy disk with a bizarre Pac-Man clone where you had to answer maths questions every time you ran into an enemy or obstacle. I’m sure for others it might be unforgiving classic Oregon Trail or globetrotting trivia quiz Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

                              <span>Building a small form factor PC is difficult. Not only do you have to find the perfect SFF case, but then you have to spec out all of the components to fit inside it - and miniaturised motherboards in particular often come at a premium, especially if you&#x27;re building a current-gen system. 
Thankfully, right now Amazon UK is doing a great deal on ASRock&#x27;s best Mini ITX motherboard for Ryzen 7000 CPUs, with a £146 asking price that comes 20% below its £187 RRP and more than £20 cheaper than the next-closest UK retailer.

In my case, that job sim  is Medieval Machines Builder, probably better known as Siege Weapon Builder.
Its free-to-play prologue goes live later this week, on top of a demo from last year. I haven&#x27;t played either the prologue or the demo and who knows, they could be rubbish, but look, I had to spend three hours this morning queuing for an appointment, and all I wanted to do during those three hours was cobble together a trebuchet from plastic chairs and retractable tape.

And, in the RTX 4080 Super’s case, even a big ol&#x27; price drop.

                              <span>If you enjoy the novelty and challenge of fiddly first-person shooter controls, do check out the free new &quot;experimental survival horror game&quot; Neural Parasite. Can you fight your way out of a Nazi bunker when everything is controlled by clicking? Even simply moving involves clicking on pictures of your left and right shoes, moving faster as you alternate shoes faster. Neural Parasite is short and it&#x27;s free, so hop to it! Or, click on one of your shoes to hop to it, I suppose.

                              <span>An unnamed former Activision executive is taking the Call of Duty publisher to court in California, accusing the company of age discrimination and violating the state&#x27;s whistleblower protection law. Said executive is a 57-year-old who worked at the company from 2014; apparently, he and six other men aged 47 or older were cut from a team of 200, as part of broader Activision Blizzard restructuring efforts last August.

                              <span>Even with the rising power of integrated graphics, the prospects of getting high-quality, high-rez gaming capability in a laptop of ultrabook proportions is still years from becoming a feasible reality. Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.
The usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.

                              <span>Welcome to another instalment of the Maw, our weekly live round-up of all things New and videogame-flavoured, as we continue our eternal efforts to appease the festering dark god of gossip and reportage. I asked the Maw if it had any 2024 resolutions last Friday, and it responded with the brain-splitting clamour of a million fell voices crying out in anguish. I have run this through our Chthonic Translator and the short version is that it wants to get down the gym now and then.
Some new game releases we are tip-toeing towards with our shields raised this week, in case they turn out to be Mimics: Allison Road-inspired horror Supernormal (8th Jan), free turn-based dungeon crawler Buriedbornes2 (10th Jan), medical management sim War Hospital (11th Jan), feudal Chinese spin-off Reigns: Three Kingdoms (11th Jan), pleasingly nonsensically-named retro RPG Crystal Story: Dawn of Dusk (13th Jan).

In addition to working on nearly every acclaimed Final Fantasy game since Nomura also helped create the Kingdom Hearts series and has become a figurehead and luminary within the stacked ranks of Square Enix&#x27;s stable of developers. But this 2015 trip to Los Angeles, California, was different.
PlayStation&#x27;s E3 2015 livestream had just revealed a teaser trailer featuring the iconic Final Fantasy VII protagonist, Cloud Strife, walking through Midgar in glorious, modern, HD graphics. The dream of so many – a remake of the classic RPG – was finally realized. The fans weren&#x27;t the only ones feeling the weight …</span>

It has maintained the top position almost every month for best-selling games in the U.S., too. Thanks to a new interview at Variety with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad, we now know Hogwarts Legacy has surpassed 22 million copies sold and it did so in less than a year. 
Haddad told Variety that Hogwarts Legacy crossed the 22 million mark at the end of 2023, picking up 2 million alone in December. He says it&#x27;s the best-selling game of the year &quot;in the entire industry worldwide.&quot; Typically, that title goes to a Call of Duty or other triple-A release.

                              <span>The virtual reality market, while not as niche as it was years ago, is still a relatively small one. Even Sony&#x27;s PlayStation VR2 launch last year seemed to come and go with little fanfare (and even less support for the platform nearly a year later). However, tech giant Apple is making its own case for VR and it&#x27;s doing so with the $3,500 Vision Pro headset launching next month. 
While we&#x27;ve known about the headset and its, frankly, absurd price since last year, today, the company announced that preorders for it will begin on Friday, January 19, with a launch on February 2.

                              <span>Over the weekend, Square Enix revealed new information about Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV’s upcoming fifth expansion, during a fan event for the popular MMO. In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.
Meet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:


A new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.


Lastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. 


Last year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.
Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer. For more info, check out this primer breaking down everything you need to know about the expansion.</span>

Intriguingly, piracy may be an unintentional &#x27;secret weapon&#x27; for Netflix.

Persona 3 was no exception and its imminent remake Persona 3 Reload seems only to be pushing it into the modern era.

From that basic interaction, it spins enjoyable yarns with some strategic underpinnings.

It&#x27;s had several followups and spin-offs since, and it&#x27;s about to get another. Reigns: Three Kingdoms, which lets you swipe your way through anccient China, will launch on January 11th.

Jools loves his boogie woogie. I can&#x27;t say for sure the two things - the angs and the boogie woogie - are related, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out. You know what definitely soothes anxiety?

                              <span>When Final Fantasy VII launched on PlayStation in 1997, it revolutionized the RPG genre and gaming as a whole. The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. 
For the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. &quot;Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for season 2 of its hit animated series, Arcane. The next chapter of the League of Legends adaptation is scheduled to premiere this November. 
Since it’s a teaser, the trailer doesn’t reveal much about what’s in store other than an ominous look at a sinister laboratory cooking up experiments that will likely pose a threat to Jinx and Co. We&#x27;re curious to see how the series follows up Season 1&#x27;s dramatic conclusion. Season 2&#x27;s cast includes returning stars Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, Kevin Alejandro, and Katie Leung. Check out the teaser below:


Arcane has been critically acclaimed by both League of Legends fans and general viewers. Here’s hoping Netflix can keep that momentum rolling into Season 2 this fall.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>Persona 3 Reload is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on February 2. If you&#x27;ve ever played a Persona game, you&#x27;re likely familiar with the &quot;opening movie,&quot; which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload&#x27;s release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called &quot;Full Moon Full Life.&quot; 
In it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. 
Check out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below:

                              <span>Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven&#x27;t played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 or Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I&#x27;d finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. 
What did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of &#x27;em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn&#x27;t even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I&#x27;m pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I&#x27;m allergic to anything over four hours - and I don&#x27;t like it.

                              <span>Seemingly not content with having raised over $650 million for a game in development for over a decade without a full release date in sight, Star Citizen is now offering a new way for those with too much money to spend it: a bundle of digital ships costing £46,000.

                              <span>This past Christmas marked the anniversary of me playing Overwatch 2. 7 years of my partner and I swearing at seemingly impenetrable enemy teams, then whooping in victory when we finally pull together a plan that cracks them apart - or just as our chill W+M1 game while we chat about our days.
For the uninitiated, Overwatch is a bright, colorful, and very funny team v team FPS that ditches the dour gunmen for a cast that doesn’t all require raw aim skill. Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there&#x27;s never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.

The article is so voluminous I’m not sure I have the energy to check. I get halfway down the page and feel like I need to pitch camp below one of the paragraph breaks, like a mountaineer sleeping beneath a crag in one of those dangling tents. Assuming we didn’t, both have been slated for 2024 release by the PlayStation blog.

                              <span>The first week of January is always one of my favourite times of the year. It&#x27;s a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I&#x27;ll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year&#x27;s resolutions. Traditionally, I don&#x27;t often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I&#x27;m aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more &#x27;nice to haves&#x27; rather than &#x27;musts&#x27;, I&#x27;d say. 
This year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you&#x27;ve also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco.

                              <span>Much as I enjoyed Spellcaster University, I was surprised it was so successful. Its dependency on randomly assigning you buildings differentiated it from the kind of full management game I&#x27;d expected, and which I assumed most people would want.
Happily, I was wrong: it did fine. Happilyer still, Mind Over Magic is here (though in early access) to provide a somewhat more traditional design, and it&#x27;s already compelling enough to turn my quick test into a seven hour delve.

                              <span>I watched Studio Ghibli&#x27;s latest film The Boy And The Heron the other day, having gone in basically blind. I knew it would be the case, but I left the cinema and said to my mate, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what just happened but what happened was great&quot;. It was a lot of things! A visual feast. Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.
Since then, we&#x27;ve listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It&#x27;s all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning. Much like Souls, Ghibli&#x27;s latest only expands as you reflect on it.

                              <span>Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread creators Bossa Studios have laid off around a third of their staff, with 19 people departing the London, UK-based independent in December due to what co-founder Henrique Olifiers has called &quot;a perfect storm of events&quot; - heavy competition from blockbuster games at the backend of last year, increased operating costs, and delayed funding decisions across the industry.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima&#x27;s new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is &quot;also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media&quot; and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That&#x27;s the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima&#x27;s latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There&#x27;s a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn&#x27;t outright necessary to prevail.
I doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it&#x27;s an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.

Published by Hollogram TV, the articles both featured positive news about Plex, based on information released to the media by Plex. The copyright complaints were filed at Facebook by anti-piracy outfit Markscan, acting on behalf of Plex.

The government has asked stakeholders for input on a copyright law amendment that would empower a local consumer protection watchdog to block copyright-infringing websites. Digital rights activists fear further normalization of Internet censorship.

                              <span>The original Outcast was a PC-exclusive, 3D open-world action game that predated Grand Theft Auto III by two years. It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds. Outcast: A New Beginning is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 15.

                              <span>PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.
Specifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game&#x27;s launch update. But if you&#x27;re looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.


Silent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). 
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

                              <span>First, there was the Xbox Series X mini-fridge, and now the Series S gets its own appliance in the form of a toaster. Bread will never be the same again. 
Feast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. 

The toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. 
Those interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.</span>

                              <span>When I was 13 years old, I struggled to beat Cynthia, the Pokémon League champion in Pokémon Platinum. U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. 
On January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the &quot;hypertapping&quot; one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and &quot;rolling,&quot; discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. 


It took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. 
IGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. 
For more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records.

                              <span>Super-powered MMO City Of Heroes closed down in November 2012, but in recent years it has been revived by industrious fans via privately-hosted servers. While those servers allowed caped crusaders to continue roleplaying, the caveat was that they could be shut down at any moment by the most dastardly supervillains of all: lawyers.

That should be less of an issue in future. One of those community-hosted servers, Homecoming, has been granted an official license to operate by City Of Heroes&#x27; IP owners NCSoft.

Alas, it didn&#x27;t meet Square Enix&#x27;s sales expectations.

Now it&#x27;s free via the Epic Games Store.

                              <span>I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it&#x27;s decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania&#x27;s locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine&#x27;s last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game&#x27;s approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you&#x27;ll find in many games.

                              <span>Russian Roulette is just an edgy version of Snakes &amp; Ladders. It&#x27;s pure luck gussied up with high stakes and the cool aesthetic of spinning a six-shooter. A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people&#x27;s teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That&#x27;s Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.

                              <span>Happy New Year, folks! Have you recovered from the all the 100+ hour RPGs that came out last year? Well, I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official &quot;big&#x27;uns&quot; calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what&#x27;s on our personal wishlists for 2024.

                              <span>Rockfish have announced that they&#x27;re updating arcade dogfighter Everspace 2 to run on Unreal Engine 5. The engine rollover will arrive as part of or alongside the game&#x27;s Incursions update in spring 2024, which includes tweaks and bugfixes as well as extra legendary items and a new game feature of some description. The idea is less to take advantage of UE5&#x27;s various whizbangs and bellwhistles, like the new Nanite geometry system, than to grease the launch chutes for future Everspace 2 updates and expansions.

                              <span>Having spent some time in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Hawaii, I&#x27;ve come to realise that it&#x27;s a wonderful place, home to trams that&#x27;ll let you see the sights and soak in the warm breeze. But moreso than that, it&#x27;s home to the previous game&#x27;s Pokémon parody, Sujimon, which has now kicked into overdrive. From what I can tell, Infinite Wealth is as much a Pokémon trainers paradise as it is a game about the Japanese criminal underworld. I&#x27;m sold.

                              <span>We got our first look at Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth&#x27;s Dondoko Island at last year&#x27;s Xbox Partner showcase. Right as it dropped, I was in New York giving the Animal Crossing-esque minigame a go myself, albeit for a quickfire half hour of bashing rubbish bags with a baseball bat and plonking a urinal on the dirt to satisfy a tutorial. Still, in that brief time I&#x27;ve come away thinking I could lose much of my life to the promise of converting a polluted island into an idyll with the power of abs and friendship. There is the strong possibility of a grind. But hey, it&#x27;s optional!

                              <span>Well, well, well. Of all the detectives in all the world, she came to me. She was a dame with hair red as communion wine spilled by a bishop looking at a nun&#x27;s cleava- oh what, wait, she&#x27;s how old? Christ, Philip, get your head out of the gutter for once, this is a family website. I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they&#x27;re actually really good. We&#x27;re going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.
The first is 1998&#x27;s Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there&#x27;s a lot to love about it right away. There&#x27;s a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil&#x27; cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version. I&#x27;m as disappointed as you.

Twitch have updated their attire policies to stop an outbreak of &quot;implied nudity&quot; among thirstier streamers, who have taken to filming themselves nude with black censor bars, or positioning the camera to suggest that they&#x27;re fully or partially naked outside the frame.

                              <span>In an effort to tackle online piracy, Lithuania has started issuing fines to online pirates. Thus far, fifty people have been handed a €140 fine, mostly for sharing pirated movies on the private torrent tracker Linkomanija. According to a local lawyer, these measures will reduce piracy, but traffic to the country&#x27;s largest torrent site seems unaffected.

That comes from a new interview with the studio’s CEO, Adam Kiciński, who discusses acquisition possibilities while providing small updates on the studio’s litany of upcoming projects.
Speaking to the Polish outlet Parkiet, Kiciński was asked about rumors regarding the studio being a target of a takeover. He states via translation, “We are not interested in being included in any larger entity. We have worked our whole lives to get to the position we have now. And we believe that in a few years we will be even bigger and stronger. We have ambitious plans and we are passionate about what we do. We value independence.”

                              <span>On January 1, Steamboat Willie, the cartoon that introduced the world to Mickey Mouse, entered the public domain, meaning the first version of Disney’s iconic mascot is (mostly) free to use by anyone. And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.
It’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey. Similar to games like Phasmophobia and Lethal Com…</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on January 30.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which gaming platform do you see yourself using the most in 2024 and why?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>Jack Black has joined the cast of the in-development live-action Minecraft movie. Rumors about this casting popped up yesterday, January 2, with Deadline reporting that Black would play Steve (the Minecraft guy with the teal shirt and blue pants). Notably, Black starred as the villainous Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie last year, giving us the instant-classic &quot;Peaches,&quot; too. 
Following that report, other outlets, like Variety, further confirmed that Black would be starring in Minecraft alongside previously announced cast members like Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Black himself even nodded to the news in an Instagram post that showed him reading a Minecraft Basics for Dummies book. However, neither he nor the fi…</span>

                              <span>Dave the Diver has surpassed 3 million units sold, developer Mintrocket has revealed. The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket&#x27;s first game. 
In Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer&#x27;s Dave the Diver review.

Dave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October. It also crossed over with indie hit Dredge last month. Shortly before that crossover, Dave the Diver picked up a nomination for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards 2023.

Today that could change in a small way, as Roccat&#x27;s excellent Pyro mechanical keyboard is down to $40 at Amazon US. That&#x27;s 50% off its original price and a solid $10 off its usual going price, making it well worth picking up.

Often if you see a &quot;quick crossword&quot; in a UK paper that means &quot;crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you&#x27;re waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot&quot;. So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It&#x27;s way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it&#x27;s just smug puns.

                              <span>I greet news of the completion of a Unity remaster for The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall with equal parts excitement and horror. Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I&#x27;m getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.
Still the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right? Perhaps I can treat it like an occasional walking sim.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for games where swords are the pointy death delivery devices they truly are, rather than the big, blunt sticks so many turn them into. First Cut: Samurai Duel seems to be aiming its blades at my heart, then. It&#x27;s a 2D sidescrolling swordfighter in which each connecting blow means instant death, and it has a January 17th release date.

The service doesn&#x27;t store any files and is not privy to what people share. However, when asked to, it will block &#x27;infringing&#x27; hashes that may lead people to pirated files. To prevent abuse, several thousand hashes were banned over the past year.

In parallel, the Vietnamese government has just published a list of sites subject to an advertising ban, which includes some of the most resilient football piracy sites. To cite a Jaws analogy, Casemiro and friends need a bigger boat.

                              <span>Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term &quot;late&quot; has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, &quot;the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.&quot; So, Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.
Original story:
Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft&#x27;s upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney&#x27;s official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, &quot;And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.&quot;
Star Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven&#x27;t spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.
For more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game&#x27;s narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Scaring players has helped put the small team at Red Candle Games on the map. Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols. This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.
Red Candle Games began in 2014 when designer Coffee Yao was developing a prototype for Detention. The side-s…</span>

                              <span>Beginning in 1989, the Prince of Persia series enjoyed consistent attention, with its longest break between releases being six years between Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame and the better-left forgotten Prince of Persia 3D. 2003’s Sands of Time and its two sequels marked a new era for Prince and, in many ways, laid the foundation for Ubisoft’s most successful franchise, Assassin’s Creed. The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.
That game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time. Though not completely ignored, thanks to the occasional cameo in other Ubisoft games and underplayed mobile releases, w…</span>

The Mexica journey to central Mexico; Moses leading the Jewish people across the desert; the founding of Rome – as told by Virgil – by those that fled the fall of Troy. Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration. On August 8, 2013, game designer Lucas Pope, the man behind the studio 3909, released Papers, Please, a game about managing migration.
Papers, Please, subtitled “A Dystopian Document Thriller,” was for some the first time they played a game whose core design ethos challenged their worldviews and understanding. Other games have placed the topic of migration front and center. Path Out (Causa Creations, 2014), an adventure game that retells the journe…</span>

This brings to an end several years of uncertainty and litigation, which saw the Lovecraftian RPG delisted from Steam several times and at one point restored by its publisher via an allegedly pirated version of the game. 

The downside is that an updated version of the game is coming to all storefronts in the coming weeks and it won&#x27;t be compatible with old save files.

                              <span>Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”


Cain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.”

Announced via a Disney Parks blog post of all things, Star Wars Outlaws ranks as the No.22 most &quot;Ooooh-Worthy Thing&quot; out of the 2024 Disney Experiences line-up - which, considering the list only stretches to 24 entries is a bit of an unfair burn on the game, if you ask me, especially when No.21 is... *checks notes* new Disney Eats and Stitch clothes collections.

                              <span>Listen, I know we&#x27;ve spent the better part of the holidays harping on about all our favourite games of 2023 (and many more besides as part of our bonus Selection Boxes), but here&#x27;s another one for you that I mainlined in a single day over Christmas and absolutely loved. It&#x27;s Makoto Wakaido&#x27;s Case Files Trilogy Deluxe - a collection of not three, but four detective stories in which you go about solving grizzly murders across different towns and villages in Japan. In short: if you like the investigation bits of Ace Attorney and need something to whet your appetite before the Apollo Justice Trilogy comes out on January 25th, this will be 100% up your street. It&#x27;s currently just over a fiver in the Steam Winter Sale, and there&#x27;s a free demo you can try as well for good measure.

                              <span>Square Enix representative director and president Takashi Kiryu has written a new year&#x27;s letter outlining the Final Fantasy publisher&#x27;s plans for 2024, while offering a few reflections on the year that was. The topline: they want to do more with generative &quot;AI&quot; machine learning tools,  and they&#x27;re still dead keen on metaversy VR/AR stuff. The blockchain remains a &quot;focus&quot;, too, though it gets much less of a billing than in 2023&#x27;s new year letter from Square Enix’s previous president Yosuke Matsuda.

                              <span>Happy new year all. What&#x27;s the weather like where you are? We&#x27;ve got Amber and Yellow warnings in London - I do not understand what these terms mean, but I&#x27;m going to add a Sapphire warning for escalating Maw activity. The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw&#x27;s petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.
Some new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I&#x27;ve just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.

                              <span>Internet provider RCN has yet another piracy liability lawsuit to deal with in the new year. Screen Media Ventures, one of the largest independent movie and TV-series distributors, claims the ISP can be held liable after subscribers downloaded and shared hundreds of the company&#x27;s films. Screen Media Ventures previously tried to join a related suit but filed its own when a federal court denied the request.

                              <span>A report last month claimed that after five years of tracking, the operator of &#x27;M&#x27;, a mysterious platform described as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest illegal comics and webtoon distribution site,&quot; had been identified. With assistance from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the suspect&#x27;s home was raided just days before Christmas. Now the dust has settled, here&#x27;s what we believe is a clearer picture of the nature of the platform and the operation to take it down.

Final Fantasy VII is full of iconic scenes. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the well-known sequences already depicted in Remake or the upcoming gut-punch at the Forgotten Capital, the Remake trilogy allows fans to experience these moments in their most fully realized forms. While this middle portion of Final Fantasy VII, which Rebirth depicts, focuses on Aerith and the looming specter of Sephiroth, so much of Rebirth&#x27;s depiction emphasizes the deepening of relationships.
This is true with how the developers approached both the main story and side content in Rebirth, and it&#x27;s sure to make it so …</span>

                              <span>Happy New Year! Now that 2024 is here, it’s time to push it the hell out of the way and look ahead to 2025. At least, that’s what it feels like the game industry is increasingly saying I should do. A number of recently revealed titles have been slapped with 2025 release windows, so I can’t help but wonder how next year will shape up and, most importantly, what the awards seasons will look like.  
There are still hundreds of games yet to fill the 2025 release calendar, but let’s pretend they won’t exist. Let’s say 95% of the game industry collectively decided to take a year off. Making games is obscenely hard, and to avoid crunch, everyone decided to take some well-deserved (and well-compensated) R&amp;R, so these seven titles are the only ones to launch in 2025.

                              <span>As 1983 came into focus, the future of video games in North America looked bleak. Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.
In the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges. With its striking red and gold design, the Family Computer, better known as the Famicom, brought arcade hits like Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. into Japanese homes.
While the Famicom would go on to revitalize the North American gaming market as the VHS-inspired Nintendo Entertainme…</span>

                              <span>Fallout: London has been in the works for five years now, culminating in a seriously impressive mod for Fallout 4 that’s essentially a brand new game set in a radiated England rather than North America. After missing its planned release window in 2023, it now has a full release date - and it’s only a few months away.

I&#x27;m writing this in the distant past of mid-December, a period of total spiritual desolation. If all has gone to plan, I am currently waving a goblet over my head like some kind of hipster barbarian, and trying to finish all the dodgy vegan Xmas food I&#x27;ve cooked which the rest of my family won’t eat, the savages.
I have now read our so-called RPS 2023 Advent Calendar and found it to be woefully deficient in flirty rebels, lunar deities and stage coaches packed with damned adventurers. Never fear, however, because by happy coincidence I have also now written an end-of-year/start-of-year round-up article about these very things.

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program). While she&#x27;s out wish-hunting, here are some Christmas Crackers to distract you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>With refreshed SUPER cards expected in the month ahead, mid-range RTX 40-series graphics cards are seeing heavy discounts at many retailers. One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. 
The deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you&#x27;re happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance.

RARBG can&#x27;t be forgotten either, and we certainly have to make a pause at the Flawless prosecution too.

                              <span>When broadcaster Canal+ obtained injunctions to block popular sports streaming sites including Footybite and Streamcheck, French ISPs were required to implement DNS blocking. In response, some users switched to third-party DNS providers, a hole that Canal+ now wants to plug. Through a lawsuit filed at a Paris court, the broadcaster hopes to compel Cloudflare, Google, and Cisco to implement similar DNS blocking measures.

Just as Final Fantasy VII Remake featured a predetermined endpoint – the escape from Midgar – Final Fantasy VII Rebirth players also know when their adventure will culminate in this game. The Forgotten Capital, the location that plays host to one of the most impactful moments in any video game, is the destination for the story contained within Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

                              <span>At the end of every year, gamers are faced with an undeniable fact: far too many video games are released in a 12-month span for anyone to reasonably play them all. It&#x27;s literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn&#x27;t even get time to touch. But even as it&#x27;s a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.
“You&#x27;ve never played this?”
I understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it&#x27;s hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…</span>

                              <span>With the year almost behind us, it&#x27;s hard not to look back at 2023 with conflicted feelings. It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. 
Between big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

Today, six years later, Microsoft owns more than 50 studios, thanks to various acquisitions over the years.
Microsoft announced in January of 2022 that it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $68.7 billion, the largest video game acquisition ever. After nearly two years of Stateside court cases with the federal government, appeals and appeasements across the pond, unprecedented document leaks, direct arguments from rivals like PlayStation, and more, the deal is complete: Xbox is home to all 19 of Activision Blizzard’s studios (and King’s 11 mobile game development st…</span>

                              <span>More than six years after the original Persona 5 arrived on U.S. store shelves, the RPG is still spitting out successors and spin-offs that capitalize on how beloved that title is to this day. The 2020 update, Persona 5 Royal, is the best-received successor, but both 2021 Musou hybrid Persona 5 Strikers and the recently released turn-based strategy RPG Persona 5 Tactica gave players plenty to love.
Among the reasons players love those games are the new additions to the cast. Each of those aforementioned titles gives the core Phantom Thieves new characters with whom to interact. Royal gave us Kasumi and Maruki, Strikers gave us Sophia and Zenkichi, and most recently, Tactica gave us Erina and Toshiro.

                              <span>The quality of video game releases in 2023 has been discussed in detail by many, and it will absolutely go down as one of the best years the medium has experienced, strictly in terms of the excellent games that were released. The larger industry and its members will always look back on 2023 with justified frustration.
Patterns in any year are always a given. Trends inspire entire genres to be prevalent, and we also have events like 2009, where there were two high-profile open-world games about super-powered humans: Infamous and Prototype. This year will certainly be remembered for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur’s Gate 3, among others, but I can’t help but notice that RPGs citing a specific era of the genre were also, inexplicably, hugely popular.

                              <span>2024 is right around the corner, and what better way to kick it off than to get some complimentary games from your PlayStation Plus subscription? As announced in the PS Blog, this month&#x27;s selection of games is headlined by A Plague Tale: Requiem, Asobo Studio&#x27;s 2022 tale of sickness and siblings. While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, &quot;Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.&quot; You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.
The other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that&#x27;s a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that&#x27;s his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, &quot;Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.&quot;D All three games will be available to download on January 2.
And as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.
