So if you were hoping to play Pocketpair’s monster-taming survival game as long-time Pokémon anime protagonist Ash Ketchum capturing and enslaving Game Freak’s…

                              <span>Full steam ahead!
We believe it quite impossible to be a shoot-&#x27;em-up lover and not have stumbled upon HOT-B’s cult classic Steel Empire, the 1992 Mega Drive-exclusive horizontal shmup that mesmerised players with incredible steampunk aesthetics, an epic soundtrack, and a stiff challenge. Far from forgotten, there have been in the past two re-releases/remasters of the game on console, one on Game Boy Advance back in 2005 and 3DS in 2014. Is this third HD revisit — based on the 2018 PC release — worth its price in coal or is it just a load of hot air? Strap in to find out.
The action takes place in a familiar yet bizarre post-industrial revolution civilisation during a great war waged between the nations of the Republic of Silverhead and the Motorhead Empire (no smirking in the back, now). In this alternate 19th century, the steam engine has become the world’s greatest invention causing military machine design to evolve into gigantic monsters of steel and fire that rule the land, the sea. and the skies. You take the role of a nameless Silverhead republican pilot onboard the aircraft carrier Rheinhalt. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the technology of Silverhead is more advanced than their opponent, evident through your choice of aircraft and the mighty &#x27;Imamio Thunder&#x27; bomb devices that can cause devastating damage to the steel-dependent Motorhead military units.

My Time at Sandrock wasn&#x27;t in the best state when it launched on Switch last November. With few &#x27;new&#x27; features and a rough performance, developer Pathea Games had a lot of work to do to make sure that there was a brighter future ahead. We recently spoke exclusively to the team about their update plans and the road ahead, and today sees the launch of the massive ver. 1.1.4 update we discussed.
Shared on the official r/MyTimeAtSandrock subreddit, the latest update sets out to fix just about every issue that you could think of including improving pop-in and frame rate problems, and adds in all of the content from the full PC release with all the PC hotfixes until 10th December thrown in too.

The new set will launch alongside Princess Peach: Showtime! (naturally) and will cost $79.99 (or your regional equivalent). These will be coming to &quot;select retailers&quot; and will also be available on My Nintendo Store for a limited time. Why for a limited time, you might ask? Because reasons.

Previously revealed costumes include Swordfighter Peach, Detective Peach (no relation to Detective Pikachu... we think), and Kung Fu Peach.

If you have been anywhere near the internet in the past week, then you likely will have walked headfirst into the chatter surrounding Palworld. Billed as &#x27;Pokémon-with-guns&#x27;, the game has racked up millions of downloads in the few days since its launch, despite growing concerns around its Pokémon &quot;inspirations&quot;.
Available on Xbox and PC, it was only going to be a matter of time before landed itself a Pokémon mod, with &#x27;official&#x27; assets taking the place of those that have increasingly been referred to as &quot;ripoff&quot; copies.

One major talking point has been the game&#x27;s monster designs, with accusations and claims it&#x27;s taken more than just &quot;inspiration&quot; from the Pokémon series. It&#x27;s admittedly raised questions about what The Pokémon Company may be thinking, and while there&#x27;s been no official response, we&#x27;ve now got the next best thing.

                              <span>It’s a little less than a month until Pacific Drive rolls out into the world. To get you ready for the game, Ironwood Studios has released a video that covers the core gameplay.


It isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.




Having played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.


I previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.


Pacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia&#x27;s RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.


In a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it&#x27;s a &quot;cutting-edge modding platform&quot; that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.




The above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We&#x27;re already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.


Also comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction


I suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it&#x27;s designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its &quot;level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine.&quot;


We know it works on older games because we&#x27;ve already seen it in action. The software &quot;works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines.&quot; Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.


Whether you&#x27;re sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other &quot;re-&quot; words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.

                              <span>As soon as the Internet first got its first look at juggernaut-to-be Palworld, many began accusing it of looking a lot like, well, let&#x27;s not play that game — you know what I&#x27;m talking about. 


Still, it seems as if it&#x27;s not enough to quench all that thirst for Pokémon content, as YouTuber ToastedShoes posted a video of a modded version of the game, replacing the pals with Pokémon and making the main character Ash.




Mechanics-wise, Palworld seems to remain essentially the same, but it feels like a weird new thing. It&#x27;s hard to avoid looking at Misty holding a shotgun and not think of the possibilities for a zombie apocalypse game set in the world of Pokémon.



The mod isn&#x27;t out yet for everyone, but Nintendo has shown they&#x27;re watching by immediately taking down ToastedShoes&#x27; original a…</span>

The importance of Project Zomboid&#x27;s Build 42 cannot be overstated. The last major revision of the long-lasting indie zombie simulator, Build 41, came out in December 2021. From that point onwards, the majority of Zomboid&#x27;s big and meaningful content and feature updates had been getting rolled up into Build 41. Examples include a substantial performance uplift, the addition of wildlife and animal/ husbandry, medieval-esque tools, fluid mechanics, map expansion, skyscrapers and bunkers, and loads more.

                              <span>With Phantom Liberty now done and dusted, CD Projekt Red is keen to get cracking on some new projects. With that in-mind, it seems the studio is now looking to make some headway on the new Witcher saga.


That&#x27;s according to a recent report from Reuters. The developer&#x27;s joint CEO, Adam Badowski, tells the publication that the team is aiming to start the &quot;production phase&quot; on the first entry in the next set of Witcher games, currently codenamed Polaris.




Badowski goes on to say that the company would like to &quot;have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year.&quot; CDPR is also at the &quot;conceptual phase&quot; regarding the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, with around 80 people expected to be working on that game by the end of 2024. CD Projekt Red has also apparently considered multiplayer elements for the new Cyberpunk, but isn&#x27;t discussing details right now.


Win some, lose some


On top of this, a recent post on Twitter announced that Phantom Liberty has been nominated for &quot;Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real-Time Project&quot; at the 22nd Annual Visual Effects Society Award.


The Cyberpunk DLC was not only the culmination of a lot of work fixing the glaring issues that plagued the game, but it was also something of a swansong for the dystopian RPG. CD Projekt Red may well take what harsh lessons it&#x27;s learned and apply them to the sequel.


However, the Reuters report goes on to say that the studio may be looking into artificial intelligence for some of its future releases. Michal Nowakowsk said he thinks &quot;AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production,&quot; but added that it couldn&#x27;t &quot;replace people.&quot; Make of that what you will.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio reset its flagship series with Yakuza: Like a Dragon, an aptly named title that saw newcomer Ichiban Kasuga take the lead in RPG hero fashion. With Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, RGG returns to the role-playing formula, with one foot in the future and the other in the past.


While Ichiban is back to lead, his predecessor Kazuma Kiryu returns, too. At first, the duo form a party together and then, eventually, split into two parties with each protagonist as their own leader. And while I dig a lot about what this does for the story, and the ways in which RGG Studio has clearly upgraded its blueprint from Y:LAD, it’s hard not to notice the stumbles it makes along the way.


Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is absolutely massive. It is a transition period for the series, mo…</span>

Due to release on February 2, Suicide Squad is also getting a suite of post-launch content, in true live-service fashion.


The very first batch of this content has only just been revealed, in fact, giving players a taste of what&#x27;s to come over the next couple of months. It should come as no surprise that much of what&#x27;s been revealed is classic live-service fare. Notably, not only was Rocksteady quite unshy about the game&#x27;s live-service leanings for some time now, but the whole thing got leaked not too long ago, adding even more fuel to the proverbial fire.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve stepped into the gaming world for even a yoctosecond these past few days, you&#x27;ll have heard of Palworld. Maybe it&#x27;s a bit cliché to say it&#x27;s taking the industry by storm, but the data shows just how massive it&#x27;s been in such a short span of time.


We&#x27;ve already spoken about how the game has been smashing Steam records, but the numbers just keep going up and up. At the time of writing, not only has Palworld surpassed 1.8 million players within the last few minutes, but it&#x27;s also become the second-most-played Steam game ever, according to stats from SteamDB. This puts it ahead of Valve&#x27;s own Counter-Strike 2.




On top of that, a recent tweet from the developer says the game has now sold more than six million copies. That&#x27;s in the space of four days, remember?


Let me catch my breath, please!


I seriously can&#x27;t keep up with the figures. Between pitching this story and writing these very words, Palworld seems to keep breaking expectations. By the time this article gets published, I&#x27;m anticipating news about how it&#x27;s elevated itself above human comprehension and has taken over the very cosmos.


But how long can something like this last? It&#x27;s not even been a week, but the number of people playing has exceeded what anyone could have predicted. It&#x27;s knocked the Steam Deck off its number one spot, which is something that even the most hyped-up games struggle to do.


And the best part is, it is still in Early Access. It&#x27;s pretty bug-ridden (it&#x27;s straight up crashed my Xbox twice already, to the point where I thought it had bricked the console at one point), but there&#x27;s something about a &quot;Pokémon-with-guns&quot; game that&#x27;s got everyone talking. Surely the bubble will burst soon, yeah?

As of January 22, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest began, providing a host of discounts on all things related to the aforementioned buccaneer and/or stealth assassin lifestyle.

You&#x27;ll find games like Sekiro, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, Pillars of Eternity II, Secret of Monkey Island, TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, and may more as part of the event. Essentially, if it&#x27;s a pirate or ninja-themed game, it&#x27;s probably here.


From laissez-faire economics to bootleggin&#x27;


Personally, I&#x27;m tempted by Monkey Island, as it&#x27;s still something I haven&#x27;t got round to playing yet. From the ninja category...well, you can&#x27;t go massively wrong with the original Shadow Warrior. Ah, 3D Realms. Whatever happened to you? Oh, yeah. You were acquired by Embracer Group.


It feels like we&#x27;ve had one Steam sale event already since 2024 began. That&#x27;s because we did. The Capitalism and Economy Fest was just a couple of weeks ago. These things tend to come around pretty quickly, I find.


Anyway, the Steam Pirates vs. Ninjas Fest is ongoing until Monday, 29 January. So the standard week-long event for these types of sales. Blow me down, me hearties, etc.

                              <span>We&#x27;re not even a month through 2024 and it&#x27;s looking to be a rough year for the games industry. Massive developer and publisher Riot Games, home to League of Legends and Valorant, announced today it has laid off 530 employees or roughly 11% of its workforce. Legends of Runetterra, Riot&#x27;s competitor to Hearthstone, is also seeing a reduction in team size and will shift focus to its Path of Champions PvE game mode. Riot Forge, a division of Riot Games that focuses on teaming up with established developers and creating unique single-player experiences in the Runterra universe, will also be sunset.





Riot Forge comes to an end


Announced in 2019, Riot Forge has worked with other developers to release five single-player games over the last four years, with a sixth game, Bandle Tale, set to …</span>

                              <span>One of my oldest memories is of a time when my sister wouldn’t let my Ghostbusters action figures bust ghosts in her Barbie doll house. The exclusion was my only major exposure to the toy.


I did watch the hit 2023 movie, which I enjoyed. I think it was a fun idea to focus on the generational impacts the toy had on women rather than try to contrive some sort of hero’s journey out of it. Wait… it was a hero’s journey! That structure shows up in the strangest places.


Anyway, that’s not the reason I bought 1993’s Barbie Super Model. I did it because I’m still recovering from one of the worst games I’ve ever played. I need some comforting shovelware. Gosh, did I get it.

                              <span>Readers with keen memories may remember that I recently self-described as being in my scented candle girlie era. I&#x27;m currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They&#x27;re just candles of lies.

                              <span>A new update for the PC Game Pass and Xbox versions of Palworld has fixed some of its many, many known issues today, but those hoping for some fixes to its online multiplayer options will sadly have to wait a little longer. Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don&#x27;t have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren&#x27;t having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some quiet time - and I certainly am, because the people upstairs are having their kitchen refitted, and the resulting powerdrill noise is literally shaking things off my desk - I recommend a stroll across the plains of Planetside 2. This might seem odd advice, given that PlanetSide 2 is a shooter in which hundreds or even thousands of players fight each other simultaneously, but the thing about planet-sized wars is that they require plenty of legroom, and the thing about crowds is that you can lose yourself within them.

                              <span>Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it&#x27;s refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word &quot;Mayan&quot; does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say &quot;the Yucatán peninsula&quot;, and sometimes &quot;the mystical land of Jukatan&quot;, which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn&#x27;t make me less sus. I&#x27;ve hedged my bets by saying &quot;Mayan-ish&quot; - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

Seeing as you voted the seminal immersive sim your seventh-favourite RPG of all time, I thought you might like to see it too. It&#x27;s very good.

                              <span>I try to be open minded, you know. What usually happens is I give an adventure game a chance though they&#x27;re all terrible (all of them), and I try. I really do. I made it several hours into Stasis Colon Bone Totem before getting frustra-bored and giving up. That may sound damning, but it&#x27;s actually very good indeed, because usually that happens within about ten minutes. I can&#x27;t say it defied my hatred of the genre as much as a The Last Express or The Cat Lady, but it had a good enough run to deserve talking about. Not least as I&#x27;m still curious about its setting.

Speaking to IGN, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno threw his own hat into the ring, saying that he&#x27;s keen to avoid fast travel in DD2 and would prefer that &quot;players travel normally and experience the world around them&quot;. If you&#x27;re someone who argues all games should let you teleport to the objective, then Itsuno thinks you&#x27;re wrong. Hey, he doesn&#x27;t mess about, and I don&#x27;t disagree with him, as long as the game isn&#x27;t actually wasting my time.

                              <span>Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a brilliant foray into turn-based chaos, but some of its RPG elements didn&#x27;t quite lead anywhere. Well, in swaggers the frankly ginormous Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth to tie off the loose ends and give us a follow-up that links all the best bits of Yakuza into a far more satisfying reward loop. Some of the refinements make for superb silliness, while others are a bit eh - not everything is perfect. But spending time with Ichiban and his pals in the sun-soaked Hawaii and beyond is the real treat. It&#x27;s a wonderful, happy JRPG and it will never fail to brighten my day. Thank goodness for Yakuza.

Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

I&#x27;m not confident I will best the reaper in Iron Fist combat. But I cannot pass up the adrenally depraved possibility of successfully performing a ten-button airborne combo on mortality made manifest. It would be rad. It would be absurd and beautiful and I know, for a fact, that Death will play as Panda. 
But will we play Tekken 8? Or roll back to Tekken 7? Hmmm. Let&#x27;s find out.

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s Avowed is a game for the more indecisive or changeable RPG player, with no &quot;enforced&quot; classes and an emphasis on easily respeccing and experimenting with different combinations of weapons and abilities. Or at least, that&#x27;s my overall takeaway from a new Xbox podcast interview featuring game director Carrie Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo. In the video, the pair delve a little deeper into last week&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct showcase and how the game compares to their previous Pillars of Eternity games, which are set in the same world.

Last night, I reached a part of the game&#x27;s Technology tree that sent an actual shiver down my spine, it was that awful and morbid. No, it wasn&#x27;t the option to arm my leaf monkey with an assault rifle, or my green squirrels with machine guns - though they were on the same tech branch. Nope, this one was even more sinister, and I absolutely refuse to unlock it.

Dubbed Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, this expanded version of the 2005 CG film is 26 minutes longer than the original. Square Enix states it features “roughly a thousand revised scenes with expanded themes and improved visuals.” 
Before the film starts, though, fans who arrive early will witness exclusive introductory content, such as a history of Final Fantasy VII presentation that explains its ties to Advent Children. Gameplay footag…</span>

                              <span>Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spends time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard.

Fittingly, these new Joy-Con are pastel pink, just like Peach&#x27;s signature dress. They will be available for purchase at select retailers and Nintendo&#x27;s online store for a limited time, although Nintendo did not mention exactly when players can buy them. 
And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach.

The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos.

                              <span>If you feel recent roguelite games have been missing that platform fighter touch, Spiritfall is here to answer the call. Developer Gentle Giant&#x27;s action game takes notes from Super Smash Bros., Brawlhalla, and similarly hectic platform fighter fare, and it&#x27;s set to launch in full on February 28, 2024.


Spiritfall has been available in Early Access since April 3, 2023, and has garnered &#x27;Very Positive&#x27; reviews from players in the months since. The release date news came along with a new animated trailer that shows off some slick cinematics and a sample of the fast-paced action at the heart of it all. 




When Spiritfall shared its Early Access update roadmap back in November, the devs detailed a few of the additions on the way to the full version. These include the final region and boss fight along with a new optional boss, fifth alternate weapon form, all challenge levels, and &quot;more surprises.&quot; Gentle Giant has stayed pretty active in updating the game since it became available, knocking out 10 monthly content updates on top of the usual intermittent hotfixes. 


Even if you haven&#x27;t played it for yourself yet, you can certainly see that platform brawler style at work in the trailer. Spiritfall combines that frantic fighting with roguelite features such as randomly generated maps and the ability to unlock new powers, upgrade skills, and gather a bunch of weapons to make the going a little less tough for each successive run. Brawlhalla by way of Dead Cells will no doubt be enough of a hook for most to at least dip their toes in what this one has to offer.

                              <span>The Umbrella Academy meets Gekkoukan High. With Persona 3 Reload launching next week, Atlus West&#x27;s YouTube released an out-of-the-blue live-action commercial with Aidan Gallagher.




Persona 3 Reload is an RPG/life sim where you take on the role of Makoto Yuki, a recent transfer to Gekkoukan High. He then becomes a member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (S.E.E.S) and takes on the many levels of Tartarus during the elusive Dark Hour at midnight. 


The almost minute-and-a-half-long trailer, titled &quot;Seal Your Fate&quot;, features The Umbrella Academy actor casually taking a stroll through the halls of Gekkoukan High and Tartarus and, of course, monologuing about time. Aidan becomes an in-game character at some points, ending off with slaying a Shadow himself. It&#x27;s a weird mix …</span>

                              <span>Teyon has announced that RoboCop: Rogue City is getting a content update that will include new game plus, a new difficulty, and an Auto9 skin. It’s available now on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.


RoboCop: Rogue City was a pleasant surprise last year. The licensed title went on to win a prestigious “On Zoey’s favorite games of 2023 list” award, one of the most unprestigious honors in the industry. One complaint I did have about the game is that I wanted to play it again after I completed it, but I didn’t want to start over from scratch. Now, it’s finally safe to reinstall it now that it will be getting new game plus.




On top of that, there’s a new, harder difficulty based on Murphy’s frequent utterance, “There Will Be Trouble.” Not much more has been revealed about the difficulty, but it’s safe to say it will be more difficult. Personally, I like playing as a walking tank, so I’m not sure being squishier will make the game more fun for me.


Finally, the Auto9 pistol gets a new skin once you complete the game. This one is gold plated, which is nicely garish. If you’re not familiar, RoboCop does allow you to pick up discarded guns off of enemies, but Murphy’s main sidearm never stops being effective. Rarely would I use anything else, except when it came to boss battles. However, not once did I stop and think it would be better if it was more ostentatious.


RoboCop: Rogue City is available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The new game plus patch has been released on PC, with the console versions getting it tomorrow.

                              <span>WWE 2K24 is strutting down the entrance ramp and headed toward the squared circle. 2K Games announced this morning that the next iteration of the wrestling sim is headed to consoles and PC in early March. 


The developer also showcased the theme for the 2024 version of the title. It will revolve around this year being the 40th anniversary of WrestleMania and will showcase the &quot;Immortals&quot; that have made an impact on the event throughout the last four decades. 




As highlighted in the Finish Your Story trailer, Cody Rhodes will don the game&#x27;s cover when it releases on March 8. For the Deluxe Edition, former WWE Women&#x27;s Champions Bianca Belair and Rhea Ripley have earned that honor. 


WWE 2K24 will incorporate a bunch of new features to separate itself from previous entries. This year&#x27;s S…</span>

                              <span>You may have noticed that at the bottom corner of your screen in Palworld, there is a string of numbers indicating what version you&#x27;re playing. Steam and Xbox Game Pass have different versions, and here&#x27;s why. 


A report from Windows Central highlighted comments from Pocketpair reps in the Palworld Discord server. There, Pocketpair&#x27;s community manager, Bucky, explained a bit about what&#x27;s going on with the different versions. The problem is that every game&#x27;s version has to go through Microsoft&#x27;s certification queue. This is something Pocketpair has no control over, though the team is &quot;desperately trying to speed up,&quot; it highlights on Discord. 



So there are actually two separate versions of the game, &quot;because the fundamental architecture is different,&quot; with version 1.2.0 awaiting certification from Microsoft. This isn&#x27;t an act of malice on Xbox&#x27;s part, though there are a few differences between the two versions. Though the version on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox One claims multiplayer is available, it isn&#x27;t. Pocketpair also noted it&#x27;s aware of &quot;serious bugs&quot; impacting servers, multiplayer, and more in an update on Twitter. 




There are also minor differences - bugs, some would call a few of them - such as the occasional lack of console keys on screen but I&#x27;ve been lucky to avoid most of them. These will also be fixed eventually, and it will take time before &quot;content parity&quot; is reached between PC and Xbox. 



It&#x27;s argued that Xbox isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;behind,&quot; but yet it is. Our list of differences demonstrates that this is the case. Nevertheless, you can enjoy the game on Xbox Game Pass without really noticing you&#x27;re playing an earlier build. 


Until features parity is reached, keep collecting Pals, building weapons, and having fun with this survival game that shocked the world by being one of 2024&#x27;s first hits.

                              <span>Ratalaika has announced that they’re publishing a collection of the two modern NES titles of the The Adventures of Panzer series. The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection comes to Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024.


The original Adventures of Panzer title was released back in 2021 by Pixelcraft Games. It was built in NES Maker, which means that it runs on original NES hardware. A Kickstarter in 2022 allowed them to also publish the game on cartridge. The Adventures of Panzer 2 followed it up in 2023, and also went through Kickstarter for physical publishing.




Both games are action platformers, both touting a humorous and light-hearted narrative. The first game sees the eponymous Panzer traveling to five different levels to try and assemble his old team. The second game, set a year after the events of the first, sees that team fighting “a new evil.” In addition to being longer at 9 levels, you&#x27;re also able to switch between the four characters.


Not much is said about the added features of the port, if any.


The NES is my happy place. Even though I was too young for it to really make an impact on my childhood, I’ve grown to love the simple graphics common on the system enforced by its hardware limitations. What I find weird about Adventures of Panzer is that the little characters look like they’re in a completely different resolution than the rest of the game, but they’re not, so maybe the pixel doubling is just a design decision. Weird.


The Adventures of Panzer: Legacy Collection releases on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Switch on January 26, 2024. It’s worth noting that at $8.99, the collection is roughly $2 more than buying the two games individually for PC on itch.io.

                              <img src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Header_Qomp2.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />
                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Atari has announced that qomp2, the follow-up to the 2021 Pong continuation, will be released on February 20 on PC and console.


qomp was a game that dared to ask dangerous questions like, “What would happen if the Pong ball escaped from the confines of the court and went on an adventure?” I’m not sure how you extrapolate further on that, but Atari and Graphite Lab are going to try. They promise “An enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly through simple effects and gameplay.” Sounds appropriately depressing.


Alongside the announcement of the release date, they released a short video of the Pong ball being interviewed in vertical cell-phone ratio, and I kind of hate it. I wonder if it’s the knee-jerk revulsion I have toward social media that’s the problem.


I didn’t play the original qomp, but it does sound like a fun premise. For a little while, at least. The first game was only played using a single button, but qomp2 adds a second one that is used for dash. It’s a logical evolution. Pong used no buttons, qomp used one, and qomp2 will use two of them.


This falls in line with Atari’s new focus on smaller games that leverage their existing brands. It’s a bit interesting that, while the original game was created by a group of indie developers under Stuffed Wombat, qomp2 has been handed off to Atari’s frequent collaborator, Graphite Lab. I have to wonder if they’ll be able to capture the same charm and impact of the original qomp.


qomp2 will launch for PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 20, 2024.

                              <span>Last week, many of us were excited to see the official reveal trailer of MachineGames&#x27; upcoming Indiana Jones title The Great Circle. But footage shown at Developer Direct last week appears to be hinting at the return of Quake.


During the showcase of the upcoming Indiana Jones release – at around the 11:35 mark – we see a quick shot of a whiteboard, covered in barely legible red ink. However, among these scrawls you can clearly make out the iconic logo from the first Quake game.




Just above that, it&#x27;s also possible to make out the characters &quot;AKE 6.&quot; Given that the first letter is almost cut off from the screen, it could be inferred that this is the other half of the word &quot;QUAKE.&quot;


Indy goes gothic


This could easily be nothing more than a throwaway reference, but the fact that it appears at all is interesting. Now, you don&#x27;t need me to tell you that there&#x27;s been no confirmation of any Quake projects in the pipeline. At least none that we&#x27;re aware of.


Having said that, with developer MachineGames taking the reins on the modern Wolfenstein titles – not to mention last year&#x27;s Quake 2 remaster, in which the studio contributed new maps – no one would be surprised if the team turned its attention to the original Quake.


Whether this would be a reboot or a new entry cannot be said, but given that the number six is present in the Indiana Jones trailer, it could be a continuation. If you&#x27;re thinking there are only four games in the Quake series, consider Quake Champions the fifth installment. Or even Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.


In any case, these are just rumors at the moment. Chances are, if anyone was going to bring the legendary FPS back, who better than id Software? But MachineGames would definitely be a solid choice, so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see if the hidden clue in the video is more than just an Easter egg.

                              <span>Outside of Resident Evil, Alone in the Dark is one of the most influential survival horror games of all time. While we wait for Pieces Interactive&#x27;s take on the upcoming reimagining, THQ Nordic has shown what you can expect if you opt for the special version of the game.


Over on the publisher&#x27;s YouTube channel (as spotted by Bloody Disgusting), we get a little showcase on the Alone in the Dark bonuses that come with the Deluxe Edition. For starters, there are some &quot;authentic Vintage Horror Filters,&quot; as well as the director&#x27;s commentary, if that&#x27;s your thing.




But the one that will strike a chord with older fans is the &quot;1992 Costume Pack.&quot; This – as the name implies – gives the new game the same, low-poly look that the original AITD release had all the way back in the early 90s.


&quot;Ma&#x27;am, please stop staring at my triangular nose.&quot;


Specifically, it affects the models, turning them from their more modern, highly detailed selves to how they originally looked. It&#x27;s a nice little way of seeing just how far we&#x27;ve come in terms of video game visuals. Also, nostalgia. Nostalgia is good as well.


While it&#x27;s been tough for Alone in the Dark to keep its head above the water – what with some mediocre reboots and new installments – this could be the one that reignites interest in the iconic series once more.


I&#x27;ll tell you for why: For me, personally, this latest attempt to breathe new life into the franchise has been penned by Mikael Hedberg. Even if you don&#x27;t recognize the name, horror fans will know his work from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Amnesia: Rebirth, and – more importantly – SOMA. That&#x27;s enough to get me excited for March 20, at least.

                              <span>While there&#x27;s nothing wrong with playing the remake of Resident Evil 4 as intended, some have been hoping for a first-person view. The VR update does allow for that, but now there is a mod for those that don&#x27;t have a headset but still want a first-person RE4 experience.


As noted by PCGamer, Nexus Mods user elsuperaguas has released the beta version of a mod for Resident Evil 4 that switches the perspective. Now, without having to use the PSVR 2, you can play last year&#x27;s remake in glorious first-person.




A recent video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil shows it in action. It&#x27;s as you would expect, bringing RE4 more in-line with the seventh and eighth installments in Capcom&#x27;s iconic survival horror series.


Even Leon&#x27;s curtains don&#x27;t get in the way


There are some things you might want to take into account before you install the mod, however. On the download page, elsuperaguas says you will need to install a few things before you can play RE4 in first-person.


Those things are:



1. &quot;Headless Leon&quot; mod so you don&#x27;t see inside Leon&#x27;s head.
2. &quot;Laser for every handgun&quot; to fix the misalign of the laser beam.
3. &quot;Invisible Weird Headgears&quot; so you don&#x27;t see the accessories.




You can also install &quot;Headless Main Characters&quot; if you want to play as Ashley or the Mercenaries content. Once all that&#x27;s done, you should be good to go.


Unsurprisingly, we declared Resident Evil 4 the best remake/remaster of 2023. Much like the modern takes on RE2 and RE3, Capcom did a fantastic job of making the classic game feel fresh without losing what made the original highly praised special.

The past couple of years have been pretty great for the Persona series on Switch. But the upcoming remake of Persona 3 — titled Persona 3 Reload — is skipping the hybrid console entirely. That&#x27;s always been the plan, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the idea isn&#x27;t there at all, says director Takuya Yamaguchi.

During the interview, Atomix asked about a Nintendo Switch version of the remake — given that Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal have all made their way to the hybrid console and have all been well received.

Do you ever look at the home screen of your Nintendo Switch and wish there was a bit more colour? A bit more chaos? Or that it was a bit less monochromatic? Well, thanks to German translator PaulFelixKelly, we&#x27;ve had a glimpse at some of the ideas and mockups Nintendo had for the menu.
Kelly managed to get hold of a prototype Nintendo Switch unit which was used for early production and development. The Prototype Switch NAND comes with 64GB of storage, but it&#x27;s also home to some development secrets, which include these menu mockups.

You may remember Pathea Games&#x27; My Time at Sandrock, a life sim game released late last November that we weren’t massively enthused with. We awarded it a 5/10 in our review, saying that the launch version&#x27;s &quot;bland presentation and technical hiccups&quot; affected this sequel to My Time at Portia. The Switch version sits with a Metascore of 62 from 11 critic reviews at the time of writing, although the PC version stands at 81.
Despite our reservations, this cozy game held a lot of potential and in the months since, the development team at Pathea has been hard at work to correct flaws and bring in new content to keep players engaged. Arguably its biggest update on Switch — version 1.1.4 — is due out imminently, and to get a better sense of what it contains and what’s on the horizon, we recently sat down for a lengthy conversation with some key staff on the Sandrock team to discuss its past and, crucially, its future.

The latest UK boxed charts are in and we have been treated to a handful of new releases this week which have started to shake up the standings.
Yes, Hogwarts Legacy and EA Sports FC 24 once again claim gold and silver, but Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has slashed its way into number four with 38% of sales coming from the Switch. The PS5&#x27;s The Last of Us Part II: Remastered snatches the bronze, also in its debut week.

                              <span>Does Apollo justice.
After the success of the original three Ace Attorney games, series creator Shu Takumi was ready to end Phoenix Wright&#x27;s story. But the world wasn&#x27;t done with these surprisingly intriguing lawyer games, and so he had to figure out how to make a new game without re-treading old ground. Thus, Apollo Justice, pointy-haired greenhorn lawyer, was born – and Phoenix was unceremoniously disbarred. The following three games, now serialised as the Apollo Justice Trilogy, serve as Apollo&#x27;s version of Phoenix&#x27;s story – but because of that tension between Takumi&#x27;s wants and the players&#x27; needs, Apollo never quite gets the spotlight all to himself.
We begin with Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, set seven years after Trials and Tribulations. In that time, a lot has happened, and the familiar angles of Wright&#x27;s face are buried behind stubble, grime, and a deep sense of ennui after having lost his attorney&#x27;s badge. But Apollo Justice, our new main character, isn&#x27;t going to give up that easily, and joins the Wright Anything Agency (formerly known as the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices) hoping to make a real difference to the legal profession. Unfortunately for him, he&#x27;s entered his career during the Dark Age Of The Law, where cowboy prosecutors and manipulative murderers will stop at nothing to get the results they want.

The Switch has seen a bevy of Ace Attorney games over the past several years, and that&#x27;s not stopping anytime soon, as Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy will be launching this week on January 25th, 2024.
If that&#x27;s not enough, however, then the good news is that fans can likely look forward to many more titles from the visual novel franchise in the future, as a recent interview from 4Gamer with producer Kenichi Hashimoto (thanks, Nintendo Everything) pretty much confirms that the series will never end.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Lowell locks and loads up the Pokémon-inspired game that&#x27;s been the talk of the town since it launched on Steam and Xbox Game Pass last week...

You might’ve heard about this little game called Palworld by now – it seems like everyone and their Growlithe is playing this Pokémon-with-guns crafting adventure. I largely ignored it leading up to its beta release as it seemed more of a gimmick than an actually compelling game, and only booted it up because I got commissioned to write a few guides for it elsewhere.

It looks like the next title from Danganronpa and Master Detective Archives: Rain Code developer Too Kyo Games might be just around the corner as series creator Kazutaka Kodaka has said that he will announce his &quot;insane&quot; new title in the &quot;not-too-distant future&quot; (thanks, Gematsu).
Shared in a recent tweet, Kodaka-san stated that he is currently hard at work on the studio&#x27;s next title, a project that he says he has become &quot;obsessed&quot; with. While there is a certain fear of burnout in the creator&#x27;s message, the &quot;insane&quot; and &quot;enthralling&quot; scenario has us interested to see what the team has been cooking up.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is finally here and has quickly been racking up praise from seemingly everyone who plays it. With such acclaim, it was only going to be a matter of time before speculation began about what the Ubisoft Montpellier team would turn their talents to next and it seems like the devs themselves have some pretty big dreams.
Last week, two of the game&#x27;s developers, Christophe Pic (world director) and Rémi Boutin (senior game designer), hosted an &#x27;Ask Us Anything&#x27; chat on the r/metroidvania Reddit forum during which they were asked a series of questions about the game, its inspirations and what it means to the Prince of Persia series as a whole.

We love a good cosplay, and boy are there a lot of good ones out there. From the uber-realistic to hyper-stylised, we have seen some certified bangers over the years. Very few, however, have been quite as mind-blowing as the little Super Metroid number we saw over the weekend (thanks, @MetroidDatabase).
Showcased at this year&#x27;s MAGFest, two builders, Carl and Matt, revealed their Mother Brain costume and it is quite something. Aside from the fact that this 16-bit beauty has been unleashed on the real world in all of its 2D pixel art glory, it also has a LED blinking eye and a light-up brain. Oh yeah, it&#x27;s also huge.

                              <span>Listen up: this is one of the simplest and most effective upgrades you can give your mechanical keyboard, and right now it&#x27;s 50% off, just $12. 
I&#x27;m talking about a full set of 104 double-shot PBT pudding keycaps from HyperX, which combine the excellent legibility of a black backlit keycap tops with frosted semi-transparent sides. This is the perfect pairing for RGB wave fanatics, but it looks just as nice with a tastefully chosen single-colour or other effects. I am a huge fan of these keycaps, and at $12 they&#x27;re an almost essential purchase for mechanical keyboard owners.

                              <span>Double-wide 32:9 gaming monitors are becoming increasingly affordable, which is brilliant for anyone that prefers an ultra-wide aspect ratio but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with the relatively limited desktop real estate of your standard 21:9 ultrawide. 
Right now you can pick up LG&#x27;s 45-inch 45GR65DC, which essentially combines two 24-inch 1440p 200Hz screens into a single titanic panel, for just $550 - rather than the usual $700. That $150 discount turns this into a great alternative to a traditional two monitor setup, letting you have tons of space for getting work done as well as a super-immersive ultrawide gaming experience - just lovely.

Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures &#x27;remastered&#x27; by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn&#x27;t have mod support. I&#x27;ll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

                              <span>Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-collecting survival game Palworld has rekindled the eternal debate over what exactly constitutes a breach of copyright. While the game&#x27;s mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks&#x27; Pokémon games. 
The developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.

                              <span>The next Cyberpunk game from CD Projekt - currently codenamed &quot;Orion&quot; - might have multiplayer in it, according to co-CEO Michal Nowakowski. Please let it be some kind of deckhead &#x27;passenger-seat-driver&#x27; mode, where you get to play a crusty celeb uploaded to another character&#x27;s brain implants, who strolls around the landscape as a hologram, offering passive-aggressive commentary. Watch those corners, samurai! Hey, you missed an ammo pack. SAMURAI ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME.
It&#x27;ll be a while till we find out for sure: Orion is still in the conceptual phase, with CD Projekt expecting to have about 80 people working on it by the end of this year. The higher priority in 2024, it seems, is the next big steaming helping of The Witcher.

                              <span>Embracer Group is once again doing sterling work to demonstrate the perils of consolidation. Piranha Bytes, who are one of well over a hundred studios that Embracer bought up in recent years, today posted a statement on Xitter saying &quot;Don&#x27;t write us off yet!&quot;. The statement goes on to say that they&#x27;re &quot;convinced they will succeed&quot;. Succeed at what, you might ask? Not being shut down by Embracer.

                              <span>For a series that&#x27;s defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom&#x27;s beloved lawyer &#x27;em up. Except poor old Apollo isn&#x27;t really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still the series&#x27; original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo&#x27;s debut game rolls its credits. What&#x27;s more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom&#x27;s first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series&#x27; best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye was caught by dozens upon dozens of spam accounts hijacking the tag to promote cryptocurrency garbage. Twitter&#x27;s journey to uselessness continues. But after reporting dozens of accounts in the vain hope that Twitter might at least knock these particular bots offline (knowing it&#x27;ll never actually address the wider problem), I was delighted to admire a great many attractive and interesting indie games.

                              <span>“Most of videogame history is alive and well due to the ability to pirate old video games,” Frank Cifaldi, founder of the Video Game History Foundation, tells me over a call. Last year, the preservation and archival non-profit put out a study revealing that 87% of games made before 2010 are out of print. “There&#x27;s no way to access them without either pirating them or buying antiques from vendors. That&#x27;s a scary place to be.”

                              <span>When Edwin popped the reveal trailer for new Metroidvania Deviator into The Maw this morning, he really wasn&#x27;t kidding about it looking a heck of a lot like Hollow Knight. You&#x27;ve got a small, diminutive hero with a nasty little blade up his sleeve, a haunting and melancholy piano score, a beautiful hand-drawn animation style, and lots of mean-looking creatures to fight. Then again, the trailer also makes it clear there are lots and lots of spikes and traps to navigate here, which puts me more in the mind of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Either way, I&#x27;m well up for another platforming-Metroidy hybrid, and developers Gami Studio have announced that there&#x27;s Steam demo coming in February.

                              <span>When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it&#x27;s among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it&#x27;s doing almost twice the numbers of Steam&#x27;s usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo&#x27;s monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck beta client update is out, and it’s made a pretty neat addition to the quick-access performance menu. A tap of the Y button now brings up a brief explainer for whichever individual setting is currently highlighted, a handy lil’ reference for anyone who wants to customise how their Deck (or Steam Deck OLED) runs without knowing exactly how things like TDP limits and half-rate shading affect performance. Clearly it’s also a brutal attack on the livelihoods of honest hardware editors who write guides to this sort of thing, but whatever, Valve.

Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he&#x27;ll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He&#x27;s second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there&#x27;s not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo&#x27;s courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.
The collection includes three games: Apollo …</span>

                              <span>Pocketpair, the devs behind the surprise record-obliterating Palworld, have just warned players about one specific bug that might seriously hinder their gameplay experience.


If you&#x27;re familiar with the &quot;Memory Reset Drug&quot;, which is used to reset character stats, take heed. The developers warn that there&#x27;s a possibility that it can permanently reduce one&#x27;s capture power.

Pocketpair says it&#x27;s investigating this issue and advises players to refrain from, uh, doing drugs until they fix this issue. 


The developers don&#x27;t specify exactly how much of your capture power will go down if this bug knocks on your door, but we have to assume your capture abilities will take a non-negligible hit. This sucks, especially if you&#x27;ve already committed to using these, but as far as release bugs go, it could&#x27;ve been much worse. 


Palworld has hit Steam and the Xbox Game Pass like a meteor — one of those from sci-fi tales that come full of wacky alien lifeforms. After not even 24 hours out, the Pokémon-inspired title was already doing numbers high to the point of dwarfing recent mega-hits such as Lethal Company. 


Some Pokémon fans have been pretty vocal in accusing Palworld of being nothing more than an edgy clone, but whether or not you care for it, I find it very hard to ignore all of the awesome — albeit sometimes questionable — things that this new title brings to the table.


As for this bug, it&#x27;s completely natural for issues such as this to hit a game on launch, and it&#x27;s expected that it&#x27;ll get fixed soon. 


You can now capture cute animals and even human NPCs on Steam and the Xbox Game Pass.

Today, we take a look at how piracy trends are evolving in different countries.  Canada emerges as a piracy hotspot, while Brazil shows a decline in piracy rates. Meanwhile, there are plenty of piracy growth regions too.

                              <span>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle was announced at this week&#x27;s Xbox Deveoper Direct. It looks good! There has been much discussion of its decision to make its tomb raiding first-person (with some third-person traversal and cutscenes), however.

In an interview with Lucasfilm.com, game director Jerk Gustafsson said first-person was &quot;part of MachineGames&#x27; DNA&quot;, and that the perspective &quot;separates our game from many other action-adventure titles.&quot;

It&#x27;s one of our most anticipated games of 2024. There&#x27;s a slight snag though: New Game+ mode, a staple of both the genre and the series, is this time locked away within the more expensive Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.

                              <span>After saying last weekend that I was aching for the cruelty of snow, I found it. When weather warnings popped up this week, I tracked forecasts and cloud movements for hours before booking a day off work to chase potential snow. When I woke up, it looked bad. Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really.

Sure, that old Phillips screwdriver your dad gave you does the job most of the time, but wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to put it somewhere safe and get something a little more adaptable? 
Walmart are doing a good deal on a Hyper Tough 77-piece screwdriver set, which is $10 versus its regular $16 - a good deal for a set that includes everything you&#x27;d need for PC building and maintenance and has attracted a 4.5/5.0 star average after 245 reviews.

                              <span>Earlier this week I reported on a great deal for the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, a 240mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon US. Today I&#x27;m back with a confusingly similar deal: an all-time low price on the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280, a 280mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon UK. It&#x27;s down to £70 following a 26% reduction, a great price for an AiO that regularly beats less powerful 360mm alternatives.

                              <span>Pocketpair&#x27;s Palworld is a very pretty game with adorable creatures and hilarious moments that provide no end of fun for players. However, they’ve left out something that many Palworld players think would improve their gameplay experience - Photo mode. 


Within the first day of playing, I racked up 11 hours of adventure with my Pals and shared a lot of screenshots of my progress. I’m not alone, either. Over a million players joined the game within the first eight hours of the Beta being released and many of them are saying the same thing — why no photo mode?


Palworld desperately needs a photo mode


With seemingly endless wild areas to explore across a huge map with stunning scenery, it’s infuriating to try and take screenshots only to have the UI blocking half of the view. Take, for in…</span>

                              <span>As with El Viento, I hadn’t heard of Sol-Deace before Retro-Bit’s reproduction of it was announced. However, it’s a good partner since, like El Viento, it was developed by Wolf Team.


Sol-Deace has something of a confusing history. It was originally released in Japan in 1990 on the Sharp X68000 where it was called Sol-Feace. It would then be ported to the Sega CD in 1991, but when it arrived on a Genesis/Mega Drive cartridge in 1992, it was named Sol-Deace. I don&#x27;t know why the name changed, but the story uses Feace and Deace as surnames, which maybe they are. Weird words to me, so I&#x27;m not sure why they chose them. If I had to guess, I’d say the words probably sound cool to the Japanese ear. However, my only basis for that is the theory that I have no other explanation.

                              <span>The very first Megami Tensei game, Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, finally has a full translation, thanks to some intrepid fans. You might be saying, “but it already has one,” but this isn’t the one you’re thinking of. This is the game created in 1987 for Japanese home computers by Telenet.


The Megami Tensei series is best known as a series of games by Atlus, which would eventually expand to Shin Megami Tensei, which includes the Persona series. The series actually began being based on a series of novels by Aya Nishitani before going off in an entirely different direction.


But before Atlus stepped in, Telenet was the first developer to create a video game adaptation. This one was for the Japanese home computers, and it was released a scant few months before Atlus released the Famicom game that would start their long-running series. Confusingly, both are called Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei. While Atlus’ version was a first-person dungeon crawler, Telenet opted for more of a top-down action RPG. Though, it&#x27;s still a dungeon crawler, make no mistake.


While Telenet’s take on the series was vastly overshadowed by Atlus, it’s still a pretty neat historical curiosity, if nothing else.


The English translation of the MSX version comes to us from Kaisaan and other collaborators. You can find the patch here at their GitHub.

It’s understandable. Cing was a niche but celebrated developer, having been behind Hotel Dusk and Little King Story. If you were a fan of the Another Code series, you probably want the folks behind it to be working on it. What would the games mean to anyone else? However, Cing went bankrupt in 2010, and the staff were scattered to the wind. Nintendo, for their part, gave no indication that any of the original creators were working on the remakes of their games.


At the time of my review, I actually wasn’t allowed to talk about the credits. But now that restriction has passed, and I …</span>

                              <span>It turns out that the idea of &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; appears to be pretty popular. Pocket Pair, the developers behind Palworld, have announced that their fledgling title is already selling incredibly well. 


How well, you ask? Well, the team revealed that sales for the newly released game have already crossed the million copies sold mark - and that was in just eight hours. 




Described by the development team as a &quot;monster-catching, survival and crafting game&quot;, Palworld just launched yesterday on Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview. It&#x27;s also available for Xbox Game Pass, though the subscription service isn&#x27;t typically accounted for in sales figures. 


Momentum was strong for Palworld leading up to its release. The night before launch, the game was ranked third on Steam&#x27;s Wishlist page. On top of that, the hodgepodge project is currently trending on X at the time of this article being published. 


I describe Palworld as a hodgepodge project because it seems to borrow lots of different ideas from other notable games. In his recent impressions of the Early Access build, Destructoid&#x27;s Eric Van Allen noted that on top of there being similarities to the Pokémon series, there are also elements of Breath of the Wild, Rust, Valheim, and Monster Hunter incorporated throughout too.


Again, Palworld will remain in an Early Access/Game Preview build for at least a year according to its Steam page. There are plenty of additions and changes that Pocket Pair plans to implement in the coming months. Amongst them will be new monsters to catch, new areas and dungeons to explore, fresh buildings and items for survival, and more. The development team also noted that they &quot;are also considering incorporating entirely new game systems based on player feedback and ideas.&quot;

                              <span>Much of the gaming world is holding its breath in anticipation of the Switch 2, or whatever Nintendo decides to call the follow-up to its hybrid console. For now, we know nothing about it, but it seems developers are already working on titles for the mystery machine (not to be confused with the van from Scooby-Doo).


According to the latest GDC State of the Game Industry survey (as spotted by VGC), about 8% of development teams are currently developing a project for the Switch successor. Considering around over 3,000 developers were asked, this equates to quite a few people saying they&#x27;re working on something for the Switch successor.




On top of this, when asked which platforms people in the industry were most interested in as developers, 32% said the Nintendo Switch successor. This is above the Xbox Series X|S and the current-gen Switch, but just behind the PS5, which 41% are still interested in.


More are working on Switch 2 games than Amazon Luna


We&#x27;ve been getting hints here and there about the elusive system. Last year, it was rumored that the next Nintendo Switch had been demoed at Gamescom 2023, exclusively for developers.


Given what we&#x27;ve seen in the GDC report, it seems likely that the console must be in the works at this point. The Switch has been out since 2017 and even with the OLED edition launching in 2021, it feels like it&#x27;s been coming to the end of its lifecycle for some time now.


Those who are said to be working on Switch 2 games are almost certainly being asked to keep mum about it. But with a decent number of dev teams saying they are involved in projects for the as-yet-to-be-announced Nintendo console, we may hopefully start to hear word about it soon. Hope springs eternal, and all that.

Would you like to know more about how to go all Starship Troopers but without the fascism on these bugs? You&#x27;ve come to the right place.


How to deal with the bug threat


Hoarding bugs can show up in seven out of the eight moons in the game, so knowing how to deal with them is very important. The first thing to learn about them is that they&#x27;re not meant to be a deadly enemy, but rather a competitor of sorts. The reason why they&#x27;re called &quot;loot&quot; or &quot;hoarding&quot; bugs is because they also like to collect stuff, which might prove a hindrance to our game. Even th…</span>

During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s rumored N64 version, Zack&#x27;s importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game&#x27;s subtitle. My money is on &quot;Reloaded.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>After years of excitement and skeptism, the Pokémon-like survival game Palworld is now available in early access. The game drops player into a collection of tropical islands inhabited by monsters called Pals that you can catch as your own. Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It&#x27;s a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.
Watch Marcus Stewart and Alex Van Aken dive into the Xbox version of Palworld from the beginning to see how the game performs in its first incarnation. For more on Palworld, check out our recent feature in which we spoke to developer Pocketpair about the studios&#x27; origins and Palworld&#x27;s creation and features.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. 
Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn&#x27;t make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too. For more, check out Game Informer&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 review and see where it ranked in our Top 10 Games of 2023.</span>

                              <span>Last Epoch is gunning for the action-RPG crown long held by Diablo (and recently contested by the likes of Path of Exile and Grim Dawn). With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

                              <span>Genshin Impact’s next update, version 4.4, will drop on January 31st. As well as bringing back the game’s Lantern Festival with rewards including a new outfit, Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze will bring the usual additions of new characters, quests and a boss. There’ll also be a new area showcased with some shiny new visual tech, that you’ll be able to explore by transforming into a flying fish.

                              <span>For a game that&#x27;s been repeatedly described as &quot;Pokémon with machineguns&quot;, the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn&#x27;t already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you&#x27;ll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak&#x27;s catch &#x27;em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can&#x27;t-believe-Nintendo&#x27;s-lawyers-haven&#x27;t-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that&#x27;s not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it&#x27;s a Pokémon game on PC you&#x27;re after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

                              <span>Palworld was obviously destined for success the moment a million games journalists and Twitter users wrote “Pokémon with machine guns”. (Acceptable alternate nicknames include “Eevees with uzis” and “Abras who’ll stab-ya”.) Having finally launched into Early Access on Steam and Game Pass this week, that prophecy has rung true as the monster-catching survival game has caught (ha, ha) so many players that its servers are struggling to handle the load.

                              <span>It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don&#x27;t know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it&#x27;s the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I&#x27;ve been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it&#x27;s trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club&#x27;s dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

It&#x27;s set to release in Q2 of this year, and there&#x27;s a demo on Steam right now if you&#x27;d like to give it a try. Expect to make nice fortresses out of Lego-style bricks, then defend them from hordes of horrors. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a recipe for a good time.

With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it&#x27;ll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

                              <span>I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I&#x27;ve since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it&#x27;s grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it&#x27;s an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

                              <span>The phrase &quot;best foot forwards&quot; implies the second foot will never be as good as the first, and that&#x27;s unfortunately the case with Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned For Danger. It has a 10/10 pun name and introduces/strengthens concepts that I expect will become series mainstays as we continue with this project, but this is definitely in &quot;difficult second album&quot; territory. I don&#x27;t hate it! But it&#x27;s no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that&#x27;s in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced what&#x27;s coming up in Season 3 of Diablo 4, and underneath the mountain&#x27;s worth of lore and loot updates, there was the surprisingly good news that WASD key controls were finally being added to help provide even more accurate and precise movement in the game over the series&#x27; traditional mouse clicks. Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night&#x27;s Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of &quot;was-dee&quot;, &quot;wased&quot; and &quot;double-you-ey-es-dee&quot; all over the shop as they debated this clearly very &quot;controversial topic&quot; live on air. Read on for more details about what they&#x27;re hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let&#x27;s get a poll up asap.

Enter yet more studio layoffs. 2023&#x27;s trend continues with Dead By Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive getting rid of about 45 staff, per Kotaku, while CI Games has laid off 10% of its workforce, including from Lords Of The Fallen studio Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior studio Underdog (via GI.Biz).

                              <span>Back in the depths of 2023&#x27;s February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I&#x27;d like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I&#x27;m very happy to report that it&#x27;s come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I&#x27;ve been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

                              <span>If you want to change your Destiny 2 wizard&#x27;s appearance, the only current method is to stash your wizard&#x27;s gear in your vault, create a whole new wizard with a new look (after deleting the old to free a character slot, if needed), grab your old wizard&#x27;s gear, then optionally replay any story bits to catch up. The MMOFPS has no barber, no surgeon, it&#x27;s new character or nothing. After six years (longer, if you count the first game), Bungie are finally planning to change this. An upcoming update will introduce the ability to change your character&#x27;s look—within limits. For drastic changes, you would still need a new wizard.

My Streak&#x27;s brown switches became a bit loud and quite rattly, which, as someone with hearing declared by an audiologist to be so sensitive that I give myself tinnitus, started to get to me. 


So I type this to you now as someone who&#x27;s graduated to Kailh low profile switches, which is proving as nutritious for my finger pads as I&#x27;d imagine its leafy homophone would be. Here&#x27;s hoping that there&#x27;s more low profile mechanical keebs out there in a few years, as the options seem very limited at the mo.

                              <span>I think we&#x27;re well into &quot;milking the gimmick&quot; territory for bodycam horror games now - last week&#x27;s Digested may have been one giant snake too many - but Zoochosis does have the additional virtue of being heavily inspired by the cute doggy scene from The Thing. And also, perhaps, Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s.
In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren&#x27;t supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren&#x27;t supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

We don&#x27;t have a Nate this week, but James has been playing Apelegs again and offers a surprising self-assessment of how he feels like he&#x27;s past his Apex Legends prime, and how confidence is a really necessary skill in competitive shooters. Worth tuning in for a listen to that.

                              <span>It’s been two whole graphics card generations since Nvidia last tried the whole Super-branded refresh thing, and from what I recall of that sweaty 2019 summer, most of the updated RTX 20 series cards were meek rejigs of GPUs that didn’t really need replacing in the first place. Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

                              <span>Four months after the troubled launch of Payday 3, developers Starbreeze have announced they&#x27;ve formed a &quot;strike team of veteran developers&quot; with the goal of bringing it &quot;up to where it will meet your expectations&quot;. The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you&#x27;re online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they&#x27;d just bought for £35.

                              <span>Your favourite beaver-based colony sim Timberborn&#x27;s latest big update has arrived, and honestly, I&#x27;d say your poor beavers won&#x27;t appreciate it one bit. The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn&#x27;t only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

                              <span>As we all know, I like vampire stories, and I like different takes on vampire stories. Yesterday Edwin dangled an upcoming visual novel called Vampire Therapist in front of my nose. I am intrigued, also because I appreciate a Ronseal approach to titles. In Vampire Therapist, out on Steam this June 17th, you play Sam, a vampire who becomes a therapist to other vampires. So the title works twice!

                              <span>Readers may remember how much I liked Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, principally because of how funny it was. It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it&#x27;s not quite as funny or as focused, but it&#x27;s also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

FatShark have detailed the closed alpha for Warhammer: Vermintide 2&#x27;s long-awaited Versus mode, in which the doughty Ubersreik Five go up against four player-controlled Skaven Pactsworn (translation: ratty supervillains) in addition to the rank-and-file AI-controlled rodent hordes. The alpha will launch in the &quot;near future&quot;, and sounds like just the dollop of rancid PvP shenanigans this lapsed Elven ranger needs to re-install one of the all-time great Warhammer adaptations, which unaccountably isn&#x27;t on our list of the best co-op games or the best multiplayer games on PC. You got something against horrible giant rats, Ed Thorn?

                              <span>Puzzle game classic Threes is getting a Steam PC launch to celebrate its 10th anniversary, developer Asher Vollmer has announced. The release date is 6th February, and here&#x27;s the Steam page. The new version adds controller and Steam cloud support together with achievements and leaderboards. Given its mobile origins, it should scrub up nicely on Steam Deck.

                              <span>The Cooler Master NR200 is a brilliant small form factor PC case - and now it&#x27;s heavily discounted at Amazon UK. This is a Mini ITX case which allows 360-degree access to the components therein, with space for a 240mm AiO or 155mm high air cooler, triple-slot graphics cards up to 330mm in length and seven fans in total. It&#x27;s often as high as £94, but for a little while now it&#x27;s been available for £70 - a great price that makes it well worth recommending to you, dear RPS reader.

Don&#x27;t be put off by &#x27;Core i3&#x27; either - this model is similar in speed to the last-gen Core i5 11600K and not too far behind the Core i7 10700K, such is the leap forward Intel made with its 12th-gen CPU architecture. Today this processor is even cheaper than normal too, with prices dropping to £88 at Ebuyer in the UK.

                              <span>Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates&#x27; response is simple: churn out more.

                              <span>The revival of this long-dormant franchise moves into the gear-and-power-gated family of games colloquially termed Metroidvanias, thanks to its similarity to early classics like Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …</span>

                              <span>Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

We also learned that it’s launching later this year. EW.com also confirmed that though Harrison Ford&#x27;s likeness will appear in the game, he will be performed by Troy Baker (The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite).
The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery.

                              <span>Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its &quot;living world,&quot; a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players&#x27; decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara&#x27;s Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents&#x27;. The game&#x27;s score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today&#x27;s live stream, is building &quot;Triumphs,&quot; or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016&#x27;s Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its &quot;Insider Program&quot; after release, implementing player feedback.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise&#x27;s history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix&#x27;s excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana&#x27;s combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it&#x27;s due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

                              <span>Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge&#x27;s Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to &quot;craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.&quot; We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses real video games you can play, including our early Palworld hands-on reactions and The Last of Us Part II Remastered review. You might&#x27;ve heard us describe the former as &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; previously, but Palworld&#x27;s crafting and survival focus make it stand out as its own unique experience. After breaking down the updates packed in with Naughty Dog&#x27;s rerelease, we shift our attention to Another Code: Recollection and Final Fantasy XVI.

                              <span>Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…</span>

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

                              <span>CI Games, the publisher behind last year&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen and the Sniper Ghost Warrior franchise, has laid off 10 percent of its staff, as first reported by GamesIndustry.biz. The publication says its sources pointed to laid-off staff posting about the job cuts on LinkedIn, but has since received confirmation from CI Games.
It&#x27;s currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio. 


CI Games CEO Marek Tymiński told GamesIndustry.biz the following:

The publication says those with knowledge of the situation at the studio said the layoffs only affected people at Behaviour&#x27;s Montreal, Canada studio, with those 45 affected let go last week, between January 9 and 11. 
However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio.

It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005&#x27;s Trace Memory for DS, and 2009&#x27;s Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.

                              <span>Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you&#x27;ll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game&#x27;s world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game&#x27;s App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.</span>

Linus průběžně informoval na Mastodonu o zlepšující se situaci, podle poslední zprávy se začalo oteplovat a dodavatel elektřiny slibuje brzké obnovení dodávek. Lidé prý už začínají vyjíždět auty ven, což podle všeho ještě není úplně bezpečné. Nemám zájem účastnit se tohoto konkrétního kontaktního sportu, a proto stále nevycházím z domu, i když obavy ze zamrzlých trubek pomalu mizí, píše Linus.</span>

Epic has since leveraged the studio&#x27;s expertise for a side game within Fortnite called Fortnite Festival, which utilizes gameplay similar to the Rock Band.

Kotaku notes that 20 percent of the company&#x27;s workforce is about 100 employees. As for why, Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz cites the company&#x27;s need to reduce costs. 
&quot;Since I joined as CEO in the fall of 2023, we have evaluated the current business and the future position of Thunderful,&quot; the company told GamesIndustry.biz. &quot;To ensure and strengthen the viability of the group, we have found no alternative other than to reduce costs and focus the business on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects.

In my bedroom, I have a drawer lovingly dubbed my &quot;drawer of sentimentality.&quot; There&#x27;s a hat signed by various members of my favorite bands of a 2010s Warped Tour, tickets to some of my favorite movies, sticks from my last year on drum line in high school, and cards.

                              <span>Wakerunners is the next game from developer Mintrocket, which made a name for itself last year with the excellent Dave the Diver. Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.
As for the game itself, you can check out the game&#x27;s teaser trailer below.


Technically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.

A demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters. Right now the game is currently only confirmed for PC.</span>

                              <span>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been reading Ubisoft director of subscriptions Philippe Tremblay&#x27;s thoughts from yesterday about how players need to &quot;get comfortable&quot; with renting their games as a package, rather than &quot;having and owning&quot; an individual copy. His broad takeaway is: that ain&#x27;t it, chief. In a social media thread today, Vincke wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not&quot;. He feels that &quot;direct from developer to players is the way&quot;. As such you shouldn&#x27;t expect Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Divinity: Original Sin 2 or any other Larian RPGs to join the Game Pass bandwagon anytime soon.

I hadn&#x27;t that expected that snark-off to be so one-sided but Morte&#x27;s cussing taunt took 80% of the votes. You have to forgive Snarks for snapping at your finger one day, Gordon, they&#x27;re just little critters. Onwards! This week, I ask you to choose between nostalgia and new styles, ya? What&#x27;s better: playing on an old patch, or asymmetrical outfits?

                              <span>When cute crafting RPG Bandle Tale: A League Of Legends Story was first announced at the end of last year, I don&#x27;t think I really appreciated the fact it was going to be the next game from the devs behind mortuary farming-me-do Graveyard Keeper. I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games&#x27; associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge&#x27;s creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what&#x27;s happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends&#x27; tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don&#x27;t let its cute looks fool you.
This is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours&#x27; worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life&#x27;s problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world&#x27;s portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there&#x27;s just as much to dig into here, so here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.

                              <span>Take the little boy with lancing white eyes from Playdead&#x27;s Limbo, ruthlessly clone him a few dozen times (an extremely Playdead thing to do) and herd all the clones into a world redolent of Klei&#x27;s Don&#x27;t Starve, and you have something like The Tribe Must Survive. Developed by apparent Macbeth fans Walking Tree Games GmbH, and published by Starbreeze, it&#x27;s a heavily horror-themed tribe management sim with a roguelike campaign loop, set in what the developers are calling the &quot;Lovecraftian Stone Age&quot;, with flagrant disregard for my nerves. Does the Lovecraftian Stone Age feature any actual walking trees? We&#x27;ll find out on February 22nd, when the game launches into early access.

If you&#x27;ve never watched it before, I recommend loading up the Twitch stream at about 1am and sort of gently dissociating while someone plays an 80s NES game you&#x27;ve never heard of. Speaking of, one of the headline acts for this year&#x27;s stream - which is running through to this Sunday 21st - was Peanut Butter, a shiba inu trained to press buttons on command, &quot;playing&quot; a NES game that came out in 1985. Although Peanut Butter obeyed his training, some technical issues colluded to snatch a world best time from him - but he raised many thousands of dollars, so good for him.
Peanut Butter is the latest high tide line in the efforts to put more weird and difficult hurdles between you and the controls of games when speedrunning or streaming them. And I must ask: where next? A cat? A snapping turtle biting pressure sensors? A Grey parrot to play a game without any input from you at all? Where will this madness end!?

                              <span>What&#x27;s the most 90s way you can market your retro-styled prequel to a 90s mech shooter? Other than an Acclaim-style stunt where you offer people £500 to tattoo their baby&#x27;s face with the game logo, I&#x27;d say perhaps releasing a Quake mod. So here&#x27;s Episode Enyo, a prequel to upcoming &quot;biopunk&quot; hack &#x27;n&#x27; slasher Slave Zero X, now available as a Bethesda-approved free add-on inside Quake.

For those of you who&#x27;d like to do your part in videogame form, dev_hell looks to be the answer. It&#x27;s a first-person deckbuilding roguelike where you play as a software developer employed by a shady corporation to &quot;reshape the future&quot;, and it&#x27;s giving off strong whiffs of Inscryption. As much as I know dev_hell will be incredibly unsettling… I&#x27;m in.

                              <span>A round of videogame company layoffs following a period of &quot;unsustainable&quot; spending? It must be a Wednesday. Swedish conglomerate Thunderful Group AB - whose corporate possessions include Somerville developer Jumpship and several teams working on the SteamWorld games - have announced that they will lay off around 20 percent of their staff as part of a restructuring program that &quot;stems primarily from over-investments made in the last few years&quot;.

                              <span>What the hell is going on in Diablo 4 these days? &quot;Devilish machinations&quot;, would you believe. Blizzard have formally unveiled the brooding action-RPG&#x27;s Season 3, aka Season of the Construct, which launches at 6pm GMT and 10am PST on January 23rd, and features a new quest line in which you investigate an ancient technology, the Loom, created by the mage Zoltun Kulle, which has now been purloined by the demon Malphas.
Along the way, you&#x27;ll both fight deadly arcane constructs (fantasy robots), and enlist one called Ayuzhan as your Seneschal Companion. These machinations aren&#x27;t just devilish, in other words. They are literal machinations, with all manner of automated foe awaiting beneath the deserts of Kehjistan.

                              <span>As the release of the (deep breath) Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft approaches (yes, that is its full and official Steam title) on February 14th, developers Aspyr have detailed some of the game&#x27;s new features over on the PlayStation Blog, and how they&#x27;ve approached bringing the art, controls and effects up to date for 2023. Personally, I&#x27;m extremely pleased to see they&#x27;ve added a photo mode, for example, as I spent inordinate amounts of time making Lara do creepy side-eye smiles during inappropriate Shadow Of The Tomb Raider scenes. But I&#x27;m also heartened to see they&#x27;ve kept in the original tank controls as an optional extra, alongside a more modern control scheme to make them more approachable.

                              <span>Dave The Diver was one of last year&#x27;s surprise hits, but though some called it an indie game, it was actually the work of Mintrocket, a subsidiary of Korean publisher Nexon. Now Mintrocket have announced their next game and it seems less likely to cause such confusion. It&#x27;s called Wakerunners, and it&#x27;s a team-based &quot;battle action game&quot; about heroes smashing at each other.

It&#x27;ll have a demo in Steam Next Fest next month and there&#x27;s a teaser trailer below.

Mezi hlavní novinky patří nová architektura WoW64, která umožňuje využít 64bitová volání z 32bitového kódu. To znamená, že je možné spouštět 32bitové aplikace systému Windows na čistě 64bitové instalaci hostitelského systému. V původním řešení bylo nutné pro běh 32bitové aplikace spouštět 32bitový hostitelský proces. Nový režim není zatím ve výchozím stavu zapnutý a je nutné ho povolit v konfiguraci.</span>

                              <span>Top Spin is returning. The 2K Sports tennis series last received an entry back in 2011, which didn&#x27;t come to PC, but while there&#x27;s no confirmed platforms for Top Spin 2K25, I choose to live in hope. You&#x27;ll find a teaser trailer below.

Update 1.1 &quot;isn’t as spectacular&quot; as its developers had first hoped, but it does buff the roguelite citybuilder with som new art, UI improvements and quality-of-life tweaks, as well as new orders to make early stage settlement building &quot;a little more interesting.&quot;

This spec also includes 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 1TB NVMe SSD, making for a powerful machine that is still portable thanks to its 14-inch frame with a 2560x1600 165Hz IPS display.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s flagship RDNA 2 graphics card, the RX 6900 XT, continues to drop in price over in the US. Right now you can pick this once-fastest-ever Radeon GPU for just $500 when you buy an open box model from Newegg. That&#x27;s outstanding, given that this card cost twice as much when it debuted in 2020. 
This is the fancy AsRock Phantom Gaming D model too, which brings a snazzy design and a faster 2340MHz boost clock (versus 2250MHz on the vanilla spec).

                              <span>Back in December, Creative Assembly posted a lengthy apology to players for their recent handling of the Total War strategy series, in particular Total War: Warhammer 3 and Total War: Pharoah. Seeking to smooth down feathers ruffled by overpricing and buggy launches, to pick out two of the biggest fan complaints, the developers offered to - amongst other things - make Pharoah’s first paid DLC pack a free update. 
That free update is now upon us, miladies and milords. Available January 25th, it&#x27;s called High Tides, and introduces two new playable factions with their own units and gods and some additional campaign mechanics. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>After teasing a 3D sequel when Prison Architect received its final update last May, developers Double Eleven and publishers Paradox Interactive have announced that, yep, Prison Architect 2 is indeed a thing that is happening - and in 3D, no less. Prisons will now have multiple floors to police, as well as a whole new inmate behaviour system to navigate along the way that will feed into gang warfare, escapes and other budding management problems. It&#x27;s coming out surprisingly soon, too, with its reveal trailer dating it for March 26th.

They&#x27;ve published a new trailer to mark the occasion, in which a group of the game&#x27;s quarantine zone mercenaries squat around a campfire, supping mugs of what probably isn&#x27;t cocoa, and listening to guitar music. It strikes a fitting note of world-weariness.

As spotted by Respawn First, Remedy (they of the Alan Wake) revealed their new logo last year, a big letter R, and Take-Two (they of the owning Rockstar Games) contest it. Rockstar&#x27;s logo is also a big letter R, although I think they&#x27;re pretty different Rs.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all got &#x27;em, right? The games we play to make ourselves feel better, to self soothe, the game we play over the Christmas break. My most recent one has been PowerWash Simulator, because it has clear goals in an organised list, it goes ding, it has a nice white noise... But imagine my shock when I re-installed Immortals Fenyx Rising for the somethingth time, and realised that it has been a comfort game for me all along.
This might make me a massive hypocrite. It&#x27;s a big Ubisoft RPG filled stuff I complain about modern games having, notably a big map of empty space filled with busywork quests and collectibles. But I don&#x27;t know what to tell you! It requires concentration but not too much, the set dressing all looks great, and it&#x27;s doing all that AAA stuff with a wink and a smile, so it&#x27;s sort of fine. It has fourth wall-breaking meta narration! How can I not like it!

Alas, we still don&#x27;t know exactly when it&#x27;s coming out yet, but in the mean time, why not gather round the burning barrel of 11 Bit&#x27;s very first gameplay trailer for it while we wait?

                              <span>Having spent what feels like an entire lifetime in JRPG Persona 5 Royal, going back to the original Persona 3 is pretty jarring. It&#x27;s unsurprising given it came out 18 years ago, but exploration is more akin to a slideshow and dungeon-running to a well-rehearsed routine.
But with an hour of Persona 3 Reload under my belt, P3&#x27;s  remake felt immediately familiar. It&#x27;s absolutely built for a seamless transition for P5-likers and takes away some of P5 Royal&#x27;s learnings, too. Unless something disastrous happens when Reload fully releases, I can&#x27;t ever see myself returning to the original.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a pitch for you: a spec ops shooter, except it&#x27;s haunted. Well, that&#x27;s exactly what early access co-op FPS Contain is going for, where four of you gear up in tactical clobber and clear corners of military chumps and anomalous… rumps? It&#x27;s a mixture of Rainbow Six, a bit of Stalker, and maybe a touch of Control, with gameplay showing real promise. It&#x27;s also got me thinking about unexpectedly scary moments in shooters, too.

Accordingly, he feels his task is to help you grow &quot;comfortable&quot; with the idea that the game you&#x27;re playing might be taken offline as part of the release schedule, with Tremblay pointing out that you can still resume your save file when the game is next available.

                              <span>A piracy blocking injunction handed down by an Indian court last September appears to have cost video delivery service JW Player over half of its usual website traffic from visitors in India. Plaintiffs Star India, Hotstar and Disney+ Hotstar, initially requested ISP blocking against less than 10 websites. However, since the court issued a dynamic+ injunction, they were free to keep adding domains, JW Player&#x27;s included. Instructions to unblock JW Player&#x27;s domain were not issued until January 9, 2024

                              <span>Developer Embark Studios surprise-launched its free-to-play FPS, The Finals, back in December – Game Informer documented everything that goes into a stealth release like this – and the game has continued to garner a strong fanbase. Now, just a little over a month since its release, Embark is set to release Update 1.5.0 and a new limited-time mode, Solo Bank It, tomorrow, January 17. 
Embark calls this mode an &quot;experimental&quot; one, pitting 12 single players against each other in PvP matches. The first to obtain a total of 40,000 &quot;Cash wins&quot; takes home the win in Solo Bank It. Similar to standard Bank It, which is already in The Finals, contestants earn Cash by collecting and depositing Coins that drop from eliminated players; Coins can also be found in vaults around the map. 
Watch The Finals Update 1.5.0 trailer for yourself below: 


Elsewhere in this update, Embark is fixing plenty of bugs and making balance changes as well. Plus, Update 1.5.0 &quot;comes with a security update to anti-cheat and fair play&quot; and a store update, too. 
Update 1.5.0 and Solo Bank It go live in The Finals tomorrow, January 17.

It did so with a quick teaser trailer revealing that it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot; Its announcement coincides with 2024&#x27;s first Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Australian Open, which began Saturday, January 13. 
&quot;Today, 2K revealed the return of TopSpin with the teaser trailer for TopSpin 2K25, the next must-play sports game from 2K that fully immerses fans into the world of tennis,&quot; a press release reads. It also notes more information about the game is &quot;to come.&quot; 
Watch the TopSpin 2K25 announcement teaser for yourself below: 


2K did not reveal a release date or a release window, but given that &quot;25&quot; is in the title, it&#x27;s likely releasing either this year or the next. The last TopSpin game was released in 2011 with Top Spin 4 during the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 generation.

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two&#x27;s work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar&#x27;s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy&#x27;s new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized &quot;R,&quot; claiming it&#x27;s too similar to Rockstar&#x27;s own &quot;R&quot; logo. 
The trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the &quot;opponent&quot; in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. 
Notably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake, which is a single game, has &quot;progressed into a production readiness stage.&quot;
While waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025.

However, you’ve got your own trick up your sleeves.

                              <span>The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.
Martha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.
The film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. 
We didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.</span>

                              <span>Developer GSC Game World will finally release S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl on September 5. The first-person shooter will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC. 
The studio announced this release date in a quick trailer released today, which also calls September 5 the &quot;final release date,&quot; indicating GSC Game World is confident it won&#x27;t be delaying its long-awaited shooter any longer. The game was set to release in the first quarter of 2024 before today&#x27;s delay.
Check out the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl final release date announcement trailer for yourself below: 


Officially confirmed in 2020, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has taken some time to get off the ground after various starts and stops. Then, following what appeared to be smoother development, the team paused its work in February 2022 due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based. Employees were forced to evacuate their homes in places like Kyiv, which is Ukraine&#x27;s capital. Some employees even volunteered to fight for Ukraine – developer Vladimir &quot;Fresh&quot; Yezhov was killed in combat in 2022, as reported by GameRant.
In December 2022, GSC Game World returned with a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 gameplay trailer, and we&#x27;ve been waiting on the game ever since. It was set to launch in 2023 before it was delayed to Q1 of this year, and now we know it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC on September 5.

                              <span>Developer 11 Bit Studio has unveiled the first full look at Frostpunk 2 gameplay. First announced in August 2021, the sequel to the bleak yet popular city-builder is also coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass.
The trailer provides a look at how decision-making appears in-game. The demands you’ll receive from your citizens appear to be as stressful as the first Frostpunk, as you control a Steward overseeing life in a city situated in an unforgiving tundra where resources are precious and everyone has their own ideas about how society should function. How do you ensure everyone gets fed? What does the education system look like? How do you keep the streets clean of literal and criminal filth? Set 30 years after the original game, citizens can vote to pass laws, and these decisions steer the city’s direction toward multiple outcomes and finales.


11 Bit also announced that Frostpunk 2 is launching on PC Game Pass, alongside Steam, The Epic Store, and GOG, in the first half of 2024. The game will also come to Game Pass on Xbox Series X/S at a later date and is targeting PlayStation 5 as well.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part II hit PlayStation 4 exclusively in 2020. Developer Naughty Dog brought us back into the world of cordyceps, Fireflies, Ellie, and Joel alongside new threats and characters like the WLF, Abby, Yara, Lev, and more. Game Informer gave the game a 10 out of 10 – read the review here – and I would have agreed with that score in 2020. I still agree with that score today, too.
If I wrote what I want to say about The Last of Us Part II&#x27;s story, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find it very familiar because it&#x27;s largely how I felt around the game&#x27;s original release. Instead, my wife, Gabriella LeBlanc, played through The Last of Us Part II Remastered&#x27;s story for the first time ever, mostly unspoiled of the adventure, and it was awesome listening to her thoughts in real-time about the game.

                              <span>Square Enix&#x27;s foam-drenched online shooter is going live next month and it will be a PlayStation Plus monthly game. For those subscribers looking to add it to their library, or for non-subscribers looking to purchase the game outright, Foamstars launches exclusively on PlayStation 4 and 5 on February 6.


As for the game itself, Foamstars is a 4 vs. 4 online multiplayer game where players take on the role of the titular Fomastars of varying classes and abilities to participate in a game called Foamsmash. Rather than simply shooting your opponent, the goal is to coat them with enough foam so that you can slide-kick them to knock them out of the match. The foam also changes the layout of the arena by creating traversable hills and defensive walls, and you can move through your own foam faste…</span>

Ever since I got my hands on Persona 3 Reload over the summer, I&#x27;ve described it to folks as &quot;Persona 3 redone in the form of Persona 5 Royal.&quot; While that may be a gross oversimplification, it&#x27;s also pretty high praise. Longtime fans of the Persona series point towards Persona 3 as the entry that changed the course of the series, pointing it down the path it&#x27;s been on for nearly the last two decades. While Persona 3 may be the most important entry from a mechanical perspective, Persona 5 has the most mainstream relevance, particularly in 2024.

                              <span>A man who sold &quot;thousands&quot; of piracy-configured TV boxes to customers in the UK has avoided prison, despite claims he generated up to £1 million. Jordon Longbottom faced a private criminal prosecution brought by the Federation Against Copyright Theft but avoided a custodial sentence after the case failed to be brought in a timely fashion. Overcrowding in UK prisons was also taken into consideration, undermining claims that small-time pirates risk custodial sentences.

Asgard’s Wrath 2 stands out in a sea of virtual reality titles available on the market today. As the showcase piece for the Meta Quest 3, this sequel offers an experience rarely seen in the category, weaving together an exciting blend of action, intricate puzzle design, and semi-open-world environments. With the clever use of VR mechanics, you discover new surprises even after playing for dozens of hours. Asgard’s Wrath 2 is a VR game that’s difficult to put down, even as the Quest 3’s battery life often requires you to. However, while it does star…</span>

                              <span>In February 2022, former designers from CD Projekt Red announced the formation of a new studio called Rebel Wolves. The team revealed its first project would be, unsurprisingly, an RPG, and today, we learned a couple more details about the game, including its title.
The game is called Dawnwalker, and Rebel Wolves describes it as a “story-driven dark fantasy role-playing adventure.” Billed as being the team&#x27;s dream RPG project, the game has officially entered the alpha stage of development, and Rebel Wolves plans to share more information about it later this year. 
The studio also announced another CD Projekt alumni Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz as the game’s creative director. Tomaszkiewicz work includes Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
“We want to craft a world that you will want to explore and dive deep into and tell stories that make you care about the characters,” said Tomaszkiewicz in a press release. “We aim to deliver an experience that will allow for a variety of choices and room for experimentation when replayed. Helping craft this experience with so many talented people will be my mission at Rebel Wolves, and I can&#x27;t wait for everyone to see what the team has been up to for quite a while now.”
Rebel Wolves didn’t share any more info on Dawnwalker, so questions about its premise, narrative, mechanics, and platforms will go unanswered until hopefully later this year. Until then, the team did release a piece of promotional art, posted above, that should help fuel imaginations of what the team is cooking.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released Tekken 8’s opening cinematic to whet fans&#x27; appetite for the game as its release date draws ever closer. The publisher also confirmed that long-time favorite Eddy Gordo will kick off the roster of Season 1 DLC fighters.
The intro cinematic is impressively rendered and, in true Tekken fashion, utterly absurd. In addition to seeing the main cast throwdown with implausible displays of martial arts, we even see them engage in a full-on battle reminiscent of the Wakanda fight in Avengers: Infinity War. 


The video concludes with the reveal that Eddy Gordo is joining the roster this spring. Since his first appearance in Tekken 3, Eddy has been both beloved and reviled for his extremely effective use of Capoeira, so we&#x27;re excited to see new tricks he has up his sleeves. 
In a neat behind-the-scenes twist, the trailer shows off some of the motion capture and animation that went into bringing Eddy into the current generation of Tekken. Eddy is the first of four characters that will be added to Tekken 8 throughout the year for purchasers of the Year 1 Season Pass or owners of the Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions of the game in which the pass is included.
Tekken 8 launches on January 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our impressions of the game’s Story mode and Arcade mode here.</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner, hitting PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29. Game Informer has been covering it all month long as the game graced the cover of our latest magazine issue, and you can read all of our exclusive Final Fantasy VII Rebirth coverage here. But, with little over a month to go until the game&#x27;s release, Square Enix has released a new trailer that teases a climactic fight between protagonist Cloud Strife and his arch-enemy, Sephiroth. 
Running exactly one minute long, this &quot;Destined for Rebirth&quot; trailer features new gameplay, shots of our party of characters like Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Aerith, and more, and lots of Sephiroth. It also features the game&#x27;s excellent combat theme, and while some might call it cheesy, it&#x27;s pretty cool to see shots of Sephiroth and Cloud timed to the rhythm of said theme. 
Check out the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth &quot;Destined for Rebirth&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PS5 on February 29, 2024.

                              <span>A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn&#x27;t have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn&#x27;t do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game&#x27;s logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
