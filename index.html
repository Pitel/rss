Developer Eighting, which is most well-known for developing licensed fighting games on Japanese tokusatsu shows and anime has revealed it led the development of the Basketball update for Nintendo Switch Sports.
A post on the developer&#x27;s website revealed that it was &quot;in charge of planning and developing the free update&quot; for the sports title. The update launched earlier today (or yesterday, depending on your timezone), and gives you multiple ways to play this brand new sport. This brings the total number of sports in the game to eight. Coincidence? Well... yes, probably.

Nintendo has revealed a rather ominous 15-second teaser trailer on its various YouTube channels, simply titled Emio.
It&#x27;s pretty spooky stuff for The Big N, and at the moment, nobody really has any idea what it&#x27;s all about. The video description asks (in hastag form) &#x27;who is Emio&#x27;, and y&#x27;know what... we don&#x27;t know! Do you?

The fantastic bullet-hell shmup Mushihimesama is set to be delisted from the Switch eShop on 10th August 2024.
Announced by publisher Live Wire, the reasoning provided for the delisting is that the licensing agreement for the Switch version has expired. It seems that rather than attempt to renew the agreement, the best course of action for Live Wire at this time is to remove it from sale entirely.

Technos’ Kunio-kun titles, a 42-strong series dabbling in various genres, began in 1986 as a simple arena brawler. Its most popular entries, however, were those that incorporated non-linear role-playing elements based around soap operatic high school thuggery. Anyone familiar with those titles, specifically on Famicom, Super Famicom, and later Nintendo 3DS, will totally understand how Fading Afternoon functions.
Developer Yeo (real name Vadim Gilyazetdinov), hailing from Moscow, has coded several titles of a similar ilk, known collectively as his Existential Dilogy. The former titles, The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa (2018) and Arrest of a Stone Buddha (2020) also borrowed from the Kunio-kun format. While notable for their experimentation and ambition, it feels like everything Yeo was seeking to perfect has come to fruition in his latest title, Fading Afternoon. Underpinned by a thoughtful, reflective narrative, everything from concept to execution is carried off with confidence and panache.

                              <span>Apex Legends recently hosted the Double Take collection event, which introduced Quads to the battle royale game. Quads, where teams of four drop onto the map, replaced the Duos (2-member teams) battle royale mode.


Now, Respawn Entertainment has brought back the Solos battle royale, where all Legends drop alone into the match, and the last Legend standing wins the match. Solos is arriving as a limited-time mode (LTM), meaning that it will only be available to play for a few days. Players can queue up in Solos mode now in Apex Legends, and up until July 23.




Apex Legends Solos mode explained


Solos mode in Apex Legends will have a total of 50 Legends per match. The loot and ring movement have also been adjusted by Respawn to provide sufficient loot and fully kitted weapons as ground loot. Like in Mixtape modes, there is also health regen active in Solos. This means that players will automatically regain health after not taking damage for six seconds.


Players will also be dropping into a match with one Respawn Token. This token will automatically respawn the player once they are eliminated, and they will arrive on the map with all their loot still in the inventory. However, this token does not work in the closing stages of the match.


There is also a kill replay which plays after you are finally eliminated from the match. The kill replay shows the POV of the opponent who eliminated you from the match.


Apex Legends has also added a feature called Battle Sense, which will automatically alert players about enemies nearby. The enemy alert will show up when there are enemies within a 50-metre range. This feature is not specific to any Legend and is automatically activated in Solos for all players.

                              <span>Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has fixed one of the most annoying issues impacting players in Helldivers 2 Patch 1.000.405: the infinite drop. This error has been plaguing fans for some time now, causing them to get stuck between missions and never actually spread managed democracy without a system restart. 


The infinite drop glitch is a pretty simple one to understand, but it&#x27;s incredibly annoying. When you set up a mission in Helldivers 2, you must select your loadout and then ready up and wait for every other player in the group to do the same. Once you&#x27;re all ready, you &#x27;drop&#x27; onto the target planet, which effectively loads you into the mission. However, the infinite drop glitch leaves you hanging in space, and you can&#x27;t get around it without restarting the device you&#x27;re playing on…</span>

Arrancar Weapon Tier List


There are now over 10 Arrancar weapons available in Type Soul, each with its own strengths and weaknesses as well as playstyles. While some weapons are better for specific builds, overall this tier list applies to the weapons slotted into most builds. 


Weapons in the S Tier are going to be top of the line for most builds and give you the easiest time in all forms of gameplay, while those in A Tier have specific builds that make them excel. Weapons…</span>

All Quincy Weapons


Out of all the Quincy Weapons in Type Soul, only one that isn&#x27;t very good at the moment. Each weapon has its own unique playstyle, so you may want to try each one out until you know which is best for you. Here are all Quincy Weapons in Type Soul:



Antithesis: Decent crit-weapon but with a lacking stun proc.

There&#x27;s no denying that games like Once Human are easier to play with a controller. As someone who mainly plays games on consoles, I believe that there are definitely merits to using a keyboard and mouse. However, it&#x27;s nice to have the option to hop between controller and keyboard and mouse, especially in games you&#x27;ll be committing hundreds of hours to like this one. While many developers prioritize controller support in their titles, there are those who don&#x27;t.…</span>

How to complete Experiencing Dadd-E in Zenless Zone Zero

                              <span>Starry Studios anticipated online survival game, Once Human, has finally arrived. If you’re looking to get into it with friends, you may wonder if you need to be on the same platform as your friends.


Once Human is cross-platform with a few caveats.


First, it should probably be noted that there is no console version yet. That’s where cross-platform is really tested. Instead, you can play the game through different PC platforms, such as Steam and Epic Games Store. Later on, it will launch on Android and iOS, which will likely also use the same servers. Console versions haven’t been solidly announced.


All the different versions of Once Human have access to the same servers. If you join the same server as your friends, you can play with them. That’s perhaps the most important part.


The big caveat is that you can’t necessarily log in with your Steam account on Epic Games Store. If you’re playing on Steam and decide you want to switch to Epic Games Store (for whatever reason, I’m not judging), then you’ll be starting fresh.


However, Starry Studios is planning to add more account options in the future that may allow for better conformity. For now, you’ll want to pick your preferred platform and stick with it.


However, to reiterate, regardless of whether you download from Steam, Epic Games Store, or Loading Bay, you can play with your friends on other platforms. It does have crossplay.

Nejnovější hackerský počin zkouší Faith Ekstrand ze společnosti Collabora. Jeho cílem je portovat ovladač pro API Vulkan z balíku Mesa a pro AMD Radeony, tedy RADV, na Windows.</span>

But recently they&#x27;ve spoken a little more about the player&#x27;s scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you&#x27;re going to have a price on your head. Makes sense.

                              <span>Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes &quot;juicy&quot;. They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo&#x27;s latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character&#x27;s attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista&#x27;s coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I&#x27;m now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

                              <span>We already know that you’ll be able to romance all your companions in the upcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Sounds a bit synthetic on the surface, right? Even fantastic games like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 suffered from this overly obliging approach to relationships. A game letting you tell your own tales is dandy and all, but those stories don’t mean much if the cast feel like input/output affection bots, ready to drop trou like a clumsy Levis temp once you’ve adequately filled their invisible bonkometer.

Verdigris Discus location in Shadow of the Erdtree


To get the Verdigris Discus in Elden Ring, it’ll be found in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. You have to pass Castle Ensis. You can either clear this legacy dungeon by defeating a major story boss or by skipping around it. 


You just have to get past this area to get to the Highroad Cross Site of Grace. This will be the major checkpoint before getting the Verdigris Discus.

Bad news: you can’t delete your character.


If you’re reading this article, there’s a chance that it’s already too late. However, before getting further into this, I will clarify that you can’t delete your character right now. This information comes from the Starry Studios Once Human launch FAQ, which also clarifies that being able to have multiple characters will be added in August 2024, which isn’t far off.

All new Uniques in Last Epoch 1.1


Uniques are incredible additions to Last Epoch, oftentimes creating entirely new builds around them. With Harbingers of Ruin, there are 30 new Unique Items in the ARPG. Even though we don&#x27;t know the exact attributes or uses of each of these, we do know the names of all of them. Here are all 30 new Uniques in Last Epoch 1.1 Harbingers of Ruin:



Aberroth&#x27;s Command
Bane of Winter


Black Blade of Chaos


Carcinization of Momentum


Celestial Doom


Cruelty


Event Horizon


Fingers of the Phantom Mire


Flames of Midnight


Flight of Quetzeri


Grim Constiution


The Inevitable


Monument of Protection


Naal&#x27;s Tooth


Nihilis


Null Portent


Orian&#x27;s Sun Seal


Palarus&#x27;s Sacred Light


Phantom Grip


Phase Point


Plague Dragon&#x27;s Tongue


Razorfall


Scales of Lemniscate


Seed of Ekkidrasil


Stealth


Sword Catcher


Traitor&#x27;s Tongue


Tribolectra


Yrun&#x27;s Penance


Wall of Nothing


World Splitter



Unique items cannot be modified through crafting, but many of them have &quot;Legendary Potential&quot; if you are familiar with games like Diablo. This special property allows them to be combined with other items to create legendary items, which inherit both the unique effects of the unique item and the affixes of the other item.

The Serpentlord Seethes is a large-scale level 100 FATE designed to be incredibly difficult, and you’ll need a large number of people in order to successfully complete it, especially this early into the latest expansion.

In this guide, we&#x27;ll explain how to activate the Exclusive Skin effect in Zenless Zone Zero, including what items you&#x27;ll need for various Agents.


How to get Exclusive Skin effects in ZZZ


Attach the designated W-Engine to an Agent to unlock the Exclusive Skin effect in ZZZ. Most characters will have a W-Engine assigned to them, typically catered to their specific Fighting Style and Attribute. For instance, Nekomata utilizes the Steel Cushion, altering her appearance during various attacks.

The Talisman, exclusive to Shadow of the Erdtree, can be found in the Shadow Keep. It&#x27;s kept away in the Specimen Storeroom, which isn&#x27;t available until after you beat the first boss of the area. Luckily, getting to the Storeroom afterward is rather straightforward. You&#x27;ll need to dodge some Fire Knights and Shadow Militiamen to get there, but at least... no, wait. There are Fire Knights and Militiamen in the Storeroom as well. Sorry. The struggle will be worth it.

                              <span>Marrying into royalty in BitLife has multiple benefits, from making a ton of money to experiencing the life of a monarchy. If you want to try something new, becoming a royal is the way to go. Fortunately, while this used to be one of the most challenging tasks in the game, a certain in-game dating app has made it easier to accomplish.


How to marry a royal in BitLife


The two main ways to marry into royalty in BitLife are to randomly find someone who&#x27;s a royal family member or to use the celebrity dating app introduced in July 2024. You&#x27;ll also need to live in a country with royalty, with your options including most European countries, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, among others.

                              <span>Pro tip: The next time an exploding Tank sends you hurling through the air, emote — it may just save your life. Emoting in the air in Helldivers 2 may reduce fall damage, and it&#x27;s a bug that&#x27;s likely here for a while.


Emoting while flying through the air isn&#x27;t a new trick to Helldivers 2 players, but the related bug that prevents fall damage is the latest topic thanks to a recent clip. As shared by Reddit user Chunke-Funke-Monke (excellent name) on the official Helldivers 2 subreddit, whipping out a salute or hug emote while in the air may prevent lethal fall damage. 




Helldivers 2 CEO asks for the fall damage emote bug to stay


The clip, posted yesterday, shows their diver sailing through the air, busting out a handshake emote before hitting the ground. Miraculously, the diver lives with about a third of their health remaining. Talk arose about the bug, and predictably, a lot of players want it to remain. The new Arrowhead Games CEO agrees.


The bug footage didn&#x27;t escape the eye of Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani. Quoting on an X post with the clip, Jorjani simply asks the official Arrowhead account: &quot;can we please, please keep this?&quot; 




If the CEO wants the bug to stay, who can say no? Well, maybe Johan Pilestedt, the former CEO. But I&#x27;d guess  he&#x27;d be on board with keeping it. 


Hell, many players are discussing how the bug can become a real feature. &quot;I wanna see two ‘divers doing this whilst playing rock / paper / scissors,&quot; says one Reddit user who was suddenly struck with pure, white-hot brilliance. Other users imagine busting out a Super Earth salute as they aim for the bushes. Jorjani also couldn&#x27;t help providing some ideas.




I think I predict what the next Super Destroyer Ship Module will be.

Completing 396 FATEs is no mean feat, so it’s nice to know that doing just that will enable you to get some very nice rewards.

Even things like Lethal Company are going for a somewhat similar vibe. But Mirowin&#x27;s Bureau of Contacts is trying something a little bit more advanced.


Very much taking cues from the likes of Phasmo, Bureau of Contacts is, on the surface, a ghost hunting horror game for up to four players. However, its biggest sell is that it attempts to magnify the scares with spooky goings-on that are intelligent and able to shift at will.

But who are these draconic deities, and why does the gang&#x27;s patron, Elefseria, want them dead? Fairy Tail 100 Year Quest’s manga has been going strong since 2018, but I’ll try to avoid spoiling things for anime-only Fairy Tail fans.

                              <span>With the release of Dawntrail, there are now 424 unique Triple Triad cards to collect in Final Fantasy XIV. Dawntrail added 19, which can be obtained through a variety of means. 


You may get lucky and obtain some of these cards completely by accident as you progress through the Dawntrail MSQ or go about your daily roulettes, but others will be harder to get. Whether you’re simply a card collector or love nothing more than a friendly match of Triple Triad, here’s how to get all of the new Dawntrail cards.

There are 8 cards to be had from winning matches with NPCs in each area of Dawntrail. In order to obtain the card, you might have to win a match multiple times, which is a task all of its own. Some of thes…</span>

                              <span>The Facet of Bravery is one of the many pieces of your Prismatic Subclass in Destiny 2 that will unlock some of the most powerful builds in the game. However, you&#x27;ve got to find it before you can use it, and unlike most of the others, it&#x27;s hidden in plain sight. 


You might already have the Facet of Bravery if you&#x27;re the type of Destiny 2 player who explores every nook and cranny during a mission. With that said, I usually do that, and I missed this one completely. It&#x27;s hidden off-the-beaten-track in one of the main campaign missions for The Final Shape, and I&#x27;d be genuinely surprised if you&#x27;ve found it with no help.

                              <span>The power of Elemental Sight is a handy exploration mechanic that allows players to see things that don&#x27;t appear to the naked eye. However, since Genshin Impact spans various platforms, the button for it varies on each device. So, to cover all the bases, we&#x27;ll show you how to use Elemental Sight on PS4, PC, and mobile.


Genshin Impact Elemental Sight guide


To perform Elemental Sight in Genshin Impact, you can use the following interactions:



PC: Hold down the Scroll Wheel on your mouse (or adjust Key Bindings) 


PS4 and PS5: &#x27;L1 + D-Pad Left&#x27; buttons


Mobile: Tap the eye icon on the top-left corner of the screen



For PC users, you must hold the middle button on your mouse to produce Elemental Sight. If you don&#x27;t have a mouse, go to the Paimon menu and select Settings to adjust the Key Bindings of Elemental Sight. Change it to your preferred button for easy access.


Alternatively, there&#x27;s an option to press the &#x27;left-Alt&#x27; key to produce a mouse on the screen. You can then click on the eye icon on the top-left corner to gain the sight temporarily.

Genshin Impact&#x27;s mobile version of Elemental Sight uses a similar tactic with the eye icon. To get it to work, simply tap the symbol at the top-left corner of the screen.


For PS4 and PS5 players, hold down the &#x27;L1&#x27; trigger (&#x27;LB&#x27; if you&#x27;re Xbox) and hit left on the D-Pad. You&#x27;ll see the symbol of the eye here, presenting the interaction for Elemental Sight.





Elemental Sight only lasts a few seconds, allowing you to find Elemental Trails. You&#x27;ll likely need this in various missions, puzzles, and domains to guide you to hidden locations. It also helps identify enemies and accessible objects to get a general sense of the lay of the land.

As reported by GFK Entertainment, the soccer (football) game took the top spot in the latest UK weekly sales charts, beating out games like Elden Ring, Hogwarts Legacy, and the recently launched Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD.

The greyscale Godzilla 70th Anniversary Edition Pinball Machine features brand new artwork, content, and a way to enjoy the franchise like never before. 


As the name suggests, the Godzilla 70th Anniversary Edition Pinball Machine celebrates the 70th anniversary of the king of movie monsters. The first movie premiered in Nagoya in October 1954, and we still adore it all these years later. This pinball machine is a tour of Godzilla&#x27;s greatest stories and battles, allowing you to jump in and find enemies you might be familiar with, others you might not be, and dozens of nods to every major entry. in the franchise.

How to lower CPU usage in The First Descendant

There are a few things people have had varied levels of success with regarding lowering CPU usage, mostly by shifting the weight from the CPU to the GPU. The quickest solution will be to disable whatever upscaler is currently active in your settings, found under the Performance tab of the game&#x27;s graphic settings.

Remember Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood? Maybe you don&#x27;t for various reasons, but the DS game was the first ever Sonic the Hedgehog RPG — and the last.
However, in a recent interview with Good Vibes Gaming, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka spoke about his desire to make an RPG starring Sonic, admitting that he has asked himself &quot;Why haven&#x27;t we done a Sonic RPG in all this time?&quot;. It seems like Iizuka-san might have forgotten about Sonic Chronicles, but we&#x27;ll let him off — it was developed by BioWare, after all.

After a year and a bit, we thought we had seen just about all of the weirdness that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had to offer. But the glitches, wild builds and hidden secrets all pale in comparison to what we&#x27;re dubbing the &#x27;HBA&#x27; (Hyrule Basketball Association) because, as it turns out, TOTK&#x27;s Moblin&#x27;s can ball (thanks, GamesRadar).
Okay, perhaps we&#x27;re stretching things a little bit here. There&#x27;s no secret location in Tears where you can catch four Moblins in a pick-up game or anything like that, but in the right environment, these beastly baddies will start putting up jumpers like they&#x27;re after a spot on the All-Star roster.

Looking back at Nintendo&#x27;s home console hardware sales over the past four decades, the line plotted by lifetime figures for each system shows a steady decline for the first two decades before a couple of huge electrocardiogram-style peaks bringing us to today.

Remember Tengen? From 1987 to 1994, it was a subsidiary of Atari Games focused on creating unlicensed titles for the NES by attempting to circumvent Nintendo&#x27;s licensee restrictions. After obtaining a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, Tengen was well on its way to creating its own NES cartridges. However, Nintendo promptly sued Tengen which eventually led to the company being consolidated into Time Warner (Atari Games&#x27; parent company at the time).
Now, in 2024, one sole developer by the name of Jeff Silvers has managed to acquire the Tengen name and has used this to create a brand new company called &#x27;Tengen Games&#x27;. According to the website, Silvers had conducted research in 2022 and discovered that nobody owned the Tengen name at the time, so simply began a lengthy process of officially registering it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The registration is now currently in the &#x27;final stages&#x27; of completion.

Masahiro Sakurai is back with another game development video and today&#x27;s lesson is all about Manga-like visuals.
The legendary game designer discusses the expressive and unrealistic techniques employed by manga and anime artists to achieve the most expressive result, specifically, how a character&#x27;s mouth appears in profile and from the front.

Pokémon Sleep, the sleep-tracking app where you can catch &#x27;em all by catching Zs, has reportedly brought in an impressive $100 million in its first year (thanks, VGC).
This is according to AppMagic data recently published by PocketGamer.Biz which reports that the lion&#x27;s share of the revenue has come from users in Japan, who have spent an estimated $73 million on the app since it launched on 17th July last year. The remaining funds have come from users in the US ($17m) and Taiwan ($4m), AppMagic&#x27;s data continues.

                              <span>The most adorable spy mission you&#x27;ll ever play.
Listen up, Spy x Family fans. Operation Strix is on and the only way to ensure world peace is to help Anya Forger with her homework. In the case of Spy x Anya: Operation Memories, that means taking her to lots of fun places and taking pictures of her while she does adorable things. It is a low-stakes, cosy adventure that will make fans of the Spy x Family smile and leave everyone else scratching their heads in confusion.
The confusion isn’t because the game is particularly complicated – it is actually delightfully, relaxingly simple. However, unless you are familiar with the characters and jokes of Spy x Family, most of the plot of Spy x Anya is going to go straight over your head. The game assumes that you know the overall goal of Operation Strix and that each of the Forgers has a secret they are keeping from everyone else. Loid is a spy. Yor is an assassin. Anya can read minds. Even the dog can see the future.

It has been a little over a year since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom landed on Switch and for many of us, the adventure is over. Sure, we might drop into Hyrule to mop up a couple more quest, do some more exploring or get lost in the wonder of it all, but, generally speaking, we&#x27;re done.
The same cannot be said for speedrunner and content creator SmallAnt. After announcing that he had reached the hallowed 100% completion rate within the first two weeks of the game&#x27;s launch, you might think that the streamer would also be finished with Link&#x27;s latest adventure. You would be wrong.

Last month, we covered a story here on Nintendo Life about a coder named Joshua Barretto who decided to do a custom rewrite of Super Mario 64 for Nintendo&#x27;s 32-bit handheld, the Game Boy Advance. If you weren&#x27;t already impressed with this technical feat, this palm-sized project has now shared a new update.
In a new video on YouTube, Barretto has shown off a handful of improvements including a complete rework of Mario&#x27;s model - with some &quot;improved proportions and better textures&quot;.

However, under EU law and supporting legal precedents, hosting companies are required to take action against infringement, as doing nothing can become quite costly.

                              <span>Read enough of our hardware articles and you’ll eventually come across someone, probably me or Katharine (RPS in peace), banging on about the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless. After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

                              <span>That was…slightly cheeky of me. The Tomoe you play in parry-ful action adventure Bloodless is not the same Tomoe that was conspicuously absent from undeniable influence Sekiro. They might be based on the same historical figure, but that’s simply Sek-ulation. However! You can make your mind up yourself for zero money, since Bloodless has a free demo on Steam.

                              <span>According to the wikihow page “how to fall safely”, the best way to minimise injury while falling is to stay loose, keep your arms and legs bent, and roll on impact. According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

Despair, ye time-constrained adults, for your carefully engineered shortage of pocket money offers no bulwark against the onslaught of games that want a slice of your evening or weekend. Today&#x27;s big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this open world survival shooter, you are a &quot;Meta-Human&quot; making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio&#x27;s existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer&#x27;s purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting &quot;don&#x27;t write us off yet!&quot; Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

                              <span>I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of &quot;dark strategy&quot; or &quot;horror strategy&quot; games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from The Fabulous Fear Machine to The Tribe Must Survive, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

That&#x27;s because developer Sucker Punch Production&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that&#x27;s almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut hit PC almost four years after the game&#x27;s initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation&#x27;s PC release strategy it detailed last month.

                              <span>Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed &quot;Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist,&quot; these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8&#x27;s primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design&#x27;s upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken&#x27;s signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there&#x27;s no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Tekken 8 review.

                              <span>Piranha Bytes, the developer of series such as Elex, Gothic, and Risen, has been shut down. The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year. 
It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!” 
However, German website GameStar (as surfaced by Eurogamer) published a story reporting the studio was…</span>

Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for the current Game Informer cover story, Veilguard will be the team&#x27;s most romantic game yet. 
Relationship Level
Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don&#x27;t help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion&#x27;s Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion.

                              <span>Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game&#x27;s website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game&#x27;s September 9 launch – there&#x27;s no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
&quot;The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down,&quot; the story description reads on the game&#x27;s website. &quot;These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order.&quot; 
The game&#x27;s listing on Apple&#x27;s App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s combat: 
And here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There&#x27;s no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

                              <span>The Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under heavy bombardment during the opening months of Russia&#x27;s invasion in 2022, a programme of artillery and air strikes that damaged or destroyed the majority of residential buildings and has killed or dispossessed thousands of people. It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game&#x27;s isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

MMO happen. EVE Vanguard - the studio&#x27;s admirable fourth crack at it - was announced last September. Since then, it&#x27;s been in gated pre-alpha, offering weekend playtests to EVE Online Omega subscribers. According to a new and rather vague roadmap, should get a substantial update this November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.

I&#x27;ve been playing the demo for &quot;cute-creepy&quot; RPG and life sim Mushroom Musume, in which you - an unnamed &quot;Recluse&quot; - cultivate and play as a series of mushroom daughters. My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She&#x27;s a Common Turquoise Truffle. She&#x27;s got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn&#x27;t tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC.

                              <span>Another year, another huge amount raised for charity by obscenely skilled gamers. Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game&#x27;s spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.

Not so in cyberpunk tactics game All Walls Must Fall. Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review. Well, now it’s a bloody free time-troubling tactical shooter. Take that, Monday!

                              <span>Have I ever bellowed breathlessly about how much I appreciate modders? If I’ve done it a thousand times, it still isn’t enough. Today’s saintly file tinkerers are MerseyRockoff and glassfish77, who’ve restored a series of boat racing quests in open world RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and made them available in a mod for your sailing pleasure.

                              <span>Two alleged Z-Library operators who were arrested in Argentina at the request of the United States, have reportedly escaped from house arrest. Russian citizens Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were facing extradition to the United States after a judge approved their transfer. After filing an appeal at the Supreme Court of Justice requesting political refugee status, the pair apparently vanished into thin air.

Anna&#x27;s Archive remains silent but did switch to a new domain name recently, which may not be entirely coincidental.

                              <span>Texture and reflection downgrades.
Beyond Good &amp; Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is out now on Switch and, by and large, it&#x27;s turned out to be a successful release for Ubisoft, boasting upgraded visuals from the original alongside some meaningful bonus material. We gave the game an 8/10 in our review, and you should definitely check out our full thoughts when you&#x27;re able.
Naturally, however, with multiplatform games such as this, the Switch version has unfortunately been subjected to a few downgrades when compared to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The most noticeable change comes with the textures: characters, objects, and environments are significantly less detailed than the game&#x27;s console counterparts, though the use of lighting is at least on par across all systems.

                              <span>Anti-piracy company Web Sheriff was once known for its off-the-wall approach to tackling infringement. Presumably part of its strategy to get noticed in the market, the company has since matured as an all-round brand protection service. Still, a pair of copyright claims sent to Cloudflare recently are so ridiculously over the top, it&#x27;s hard to take them seriously. Unexpectedly, Cloudflare responded by blocking URLs on two pirate sites leading to the rarely-seen &#x27;451&#x27; error.

Stick to games!” is a common refrain you might hear from the sort of winning individual who thinks books are a communist plot to lower their sperm count. Luckily, those people are elsewhere, so I hope you’ll allow me a brief moment of relief that the Tories are no longer in power. This is a great thing, providing you have absolutely no follow-up questions! This week, it’s QWOP, Getting Over It, and Ape Out&#x27;s Bennet Foddy! Cheers Bennet! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

                              <span>Few types of media hook me like a good documentary. The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…</span>

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…</span>

Space Age will arrive this October alongside a major 2.0 update for the moreish factory-automating hit, with the expansion costing as much as the base game. It sounds like there’ll be plenty to show for that price, mind.

Though to what degree you could consider it alive and well - reanimated in a twisted form of its previous glory, perhaps - is another question entirely.

Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Sokoban! A game whose name I recognise as shorthand for this type of puzzle, and yet have never seen. It&#x27;s also a genre I&#x27;m not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre&#x27;s psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

                              <span>We never covered the original Nocturnal, an “intense 3-hour-long action-platformer” from Sunnyside Games, but the Steam user reception seems very positive for a pay-upfront game that actively describes itself as three hours long, and the just-announced sequel seems excellently awash with fire, darkness and death. It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

                              <span>The space industrialism of Satisfactory is distinct from other efficiency sims about making endless conveyor belts in two important ways. One: it&#x27;s a mash-up with the first-person survival genre that sees you stranded on an alien planet, a la Subnautica. Two: there is a dedicated coffee cup item from which you can leisurely sip. It&#x27;s been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it&#x27;s rather good. We knew developers Coffee Stain were planning a 1.0 release this year. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say. The complete version will include flushable toilets, a &quot;much sought after addition to the game&quot;, we&#x27;re told.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this applies in other countries, but in England we have this thing where you&#x27;ll stroll down some random suburban street without a care in the world, and stumble on a house that has been absolutely overrun by garden gnomes. A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook&#x27;s face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it&#x27;s not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook&#x27;s kit. The better Rook&#x27;s belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …</span>

We&#x27;re also joined by our wonderful podcast editor Matt Storm to give their thoughts on Alan Wake 2&#x27;s Night Springs DLC, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and their first foray into Sam Barlow&#x27;s Immortality. Marcus Stewart spills the tea on his time playing the closed beta for the bubbly open-world dress up game Infinity Nikki and his first excursion through the typing-based dungeon crawler Cryptmaster. We round the show with Kyle Hillard and Marcus giving their obligatory Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree check-ins.

                              <span>Deflecting a crossbow’s bolt in real life takes practice. In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.
And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…</span>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”
Like the original, Monaco 2 is a game about pulling of…</span>

                              <span>The culture around social interaction is constantly shifting, but those profoundly strange years of the pandemic were especially jarring. In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.
For some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever. If home is your first place, and work is your second, the third place is the other social and gathering hub for your life as part of a c…</span>

                              <span>OpenAI wants to know to what degree New York Times articles are &#x27;original&#x27; and worthy of copyright protection. The AI company is seeking journalists&#x27; source materials to assist in its defense of a multi-million copyright infringement claim previously filed by the newspaper. The Times objects to this and other information requests, suggesting that OpenAI&#x27;s approach is overbroad and could potentially have a chilling effect.

                              <span>When settlement-focused rightsholders spot a pirated movie being shared, they want to hold someone liable. Internet bill payers are regular targets, also in Canada where a movie studio painted 30 subscribers as &#x27;authorizers&#x27; of movie piracy on BitTorrent. Hopes of a favorable ruling at the Supreme Court are now dead after the studio&#x27;s appeal was denied. In its place, greater clarity for bill payers and an increased evidential burden for piracy settlement factories.

To be fair we did once tackle this topic with a preliminary blast of recommendations for those completely new to the genre. We also have a few familiar fantasys in our list of the 50 best RPGs on PC. But until now we haven&#x27;t addressed the genre in its own right. In an act of contrition, we offer you this: our list of the best JRPGs you can play on PC this year, according to our own tastes.

                              <span>Surgent Studios, developers of this year’s fetching Afrofuturist platformer Tales of Kenzera: Zau, have laid off more than a dozen staff. The cuts come just over two months on from the release of the debut video game release from the multimedia studio founded by Assassin’s Creed Origins star Abubakar Salim.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no genre like the open world for inducing choice paralysis, so it&#x27;s fitting that I&#x27;ve been agonising over how to begin this irregular article series on open world games for months. I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it&#x27;s best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

It also doesn’t work right now. But for one brief, debatably glorious day on June 29th, it did. And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

Nexon are even now patching the game, and have plied players with in-game bonuses and cosmetics as an apology for the inconvenience.

It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

                              <span>EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process.

June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn&#x27;t be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn&#x27;t work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you&#x27;ve got a few more months to enjoy the ride.
For more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.</span>

                              <span>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Tales of Kenzera: Zau, has announced it is laying off just over a dozen employees. This follows the release of its first game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, back in April, which launched to good reviews. 
Surgent doesn&#x27;t explain why; it says it&#x27;s focusing on supporting those affected, continuing work on Tales of Kenzera: Zau, and looking ahead to future projects. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s statement, in full: 
Studio head and founder Abubakar Salim, who also voiced the titular Zau in the team&#x27;s first game, released his own statement addressing the layoffs: 
Surgent Studios grows an unfortunately ever-growing list of studios affected by layoffs in 2024.

                              <span>This February, Spanish football league LaLiga obtained a court order that supposedly allowed it to pursue mere viewers of pirate IPTV. A local court soon clarified that viewers would not be targeted. However, letters from LaLiga&#x27;s lawyers, demanding 450 euros to prevent legal action, run counter to those assurances. That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific &#x27;pirate&#x27; servers, is of even greater concern.

                              <span>The Fear &amp; Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

                              <span>When Edwin disappeared into the hot mists of Summer Games Fest we couldn&#x27;t know he would return with a crazed look in his eye, raving about &quot;phantasmagorical mulch&quot; and insisting: &quot;As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence.&quot; That&#x27;s because he played Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess, the upcoming action strategy game about defending a maiden from colourful monsters and recruiting villagers to cleanse demonic defilement. Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

                              <span>Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game&#x27;s silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there&#x27;s still no release date – it&#x27;s launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you&#x27;ve seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Hasbro and developer Outright Games have revealed Transformers: Galactic Trials, an arcade robot racing game with roguelite combat. It launches on October 11 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. 
The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer&#x27;s Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


&quot;Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
&quot;Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It&#x27;s the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers&#x27; abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron.&quot; 
Transformers: Galactic Trials hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 11, 2024.

It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here&#x27;s a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title. 


Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become availabl…</span>

I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.

That&#x27;s extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It&#x27;s easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I&#x27;ve ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve all seen it. The little spinning symbol cautioning players against impatient acts of powering down. &quot;Don&#x27;t turn off your system when this symbol is displayed,&quot; goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that&#x27;s being written to some folder deep in your PC&#x27;s innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m a gamer, not an ideas man.

Not two months on from REDKit’s release, ‘Tuber xLetalis and modder glassfish - a contributor to the cut-content-restoring Brothers in Arms mod - have put together a showcase containing around 20 minutes of cut content from the game’s ending.

                              <span>The developers of speedy first-person shooter Selaco have dropped a big patch for the retro blaster, adding new weapon upgrades and mutators that can change the game&#x27;s difficulty in piecemeal ways, like making enemies stronger for an added challenge. There&#x27;s a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. &quot;We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons,&quot; the developers say. But wait, isn&#x27;t there a slide kick in the game already?

A delicious ‘fruit and nut’ bar, if you will.

                              <span>You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it&#x27;s not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it&#x27;s a &quot;boss rush&quot; with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I&#x27;d like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke &#x3D; is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it&#x27;s a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There&#x27;s a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

                              <span>Finally, some decent weather round these parts. And I don&#x27;t mean good weather, you perverse sun-lovers. I mean some real wind and rain to clear the air. Sitting at my desk next to the window, my eye keeps being caught by the hypnotic swaying of the treetops. It&#x27;s quite magical, really. I might go for a walk later.
Just kidding. I&#x27;m superglued to my desk chair (thankfully it&#x27;s a very comfy chair), and I&#x27;m ready for a weekend that&#x27;s distinguishable from the weekdays only in name. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Dune Imperium is a fabulous strategy game about becoming the biggest spice boy on a sandy planet I presume is called Dune. I love it despite never having read the Dune books or watched the Dune movies, because the digital version taught me everything I needed to know about Barry Harkonnen, Oscar Isaac, the tall guy from Guardians Of The Galaxy, and their insatiable pursuit of space nutmeg.

Now the board game&#x27;s first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it&#x27;s called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

                              <span>It&#x27;s said that every time Deus Ex is mentioned, someone reinstalls it. If that&#x27;s true and you read RPS, it&#x27;s possible you&#x27;ve reinstalled Deus Ex around six hundred times by now. 

That&#x27;s where the comprehensive Randomizer mod comes in, which remixes the immersive sim&#x27;s levels to make the experience fresh every time. It&#x27;s also just received a major update which, among several other additions, lets you pet the game&#x27;s dogs and cats.

Still, talk to one of those players and you&#x27;ll find all is not well with Valve&#x27;s shooter, which is apparently regularly overrun by bots and cheaters.

Some players are now reporting &quot;a large ban wave&quot; targeting users of aimbots, however.

                              <span>Mika and The Witch&#x27;s Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it&#x27;s a &quot;mini open world&quot; game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.

                              <span>We didn&#x27;t get to Sandfall and Kepler Interactive&#x27;s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 during our coverage of Microsoft&#x27;s summer showcase, a couple of weeks ago. If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while &quot;omnimanouevring&quot; around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this &quot;evolution of JRPGs&quot;, in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.

                              <span>Let me continue the theme from our round-up of Steam sale reccs for under a tenner, while exchanging the concept of money for the concept of time: what can you do in celebrated open world &quot;anecdote generator&quot; Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 in two hours or less? Two hours being the length of the free Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I&#x27;m so confident of this, in fact, that I&#x27;m going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?

                              <span>The makers of Cyberpunk 2077 host a podcast every once in a while, in which the studio&#x27;s developers chat about what&#x27;s going on in the company. In the latest episode, they&#x27;re discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it&#x27;s spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There&#x27;s a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer&#x27;s earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG&#x27;s shortcomings. 
&quot;I see that we didn&#x27;t push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance,&quot; said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  &quot;Like, let&#x27;s say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I&#x27;m like, we weren&#x27;t far enough in &#x27;77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time of the year again. You know the one. Numbers you’d previously shunned for being too high have suddenly gotten smaller, and purchases have shifted categories from impractical to impulsively justifiable. It’s the Steam Summer Sale 2024! There’s no rush, of course. It runs until the 11th of July. Still, to help you navigate the meatily chummed waters of Sales Lagoon, Horace has decided to reward our combined years of service with a crisp ten bob note each to spend on games. We’ve been bringing up the whole “getting paid” thing for ages, so this is a real win for us. Here’s how we’re all spending that tenner in the sale.

                              <span>I think I&#x27;ve written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think Elden Ring is a massive open world game that&#x27;s a bit too large and in charge. I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC&#x27;s come out, I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll reach it again despite the fact I think it&#x27;s very good. It&#x27;s interesting then, that FromSoftware&#x27;s president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as &quot;the limit&quot; for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it&#x27;s a great thing, personally.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the open world series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, via one of those odd promotional things disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we&#x27;ve created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.
Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming &quot;Souls-lite&quot; fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: &quot;Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut. Unfamiliar viewers either dismissed it as an overly whimsical dress-up game or found themselves unexpectedly intrigued by its delightful and unique spin on an open-world experience.

                              <span>Developer Don&#x27;t Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don&#x27;t Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017&#x27;s Before the Storm and 2021&#x27;s True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We&#x27;ve made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage to early 2025. We know you&#x27;re all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine.

Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange&#x27;s endings.

                              <span>Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.
With any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.
If this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.

                              <span>To start a modern Atlus game is to dive headfirst into an ice-cold bath of unbearably swish UI design, a brimming tub of Cool Fonts and Flash Segues. Metaphor: ReFantazio, the first (going by the colon usage) in a new series of RPGs helmed by Persona series director Katsura Hashino, is no exception. It might be set in a medieval fantasy realm, a relatively straight-laced world of square masonry and parchment maps, but it portrays bread-and-butter RPG fixtures with much the same flair as its strutting high school cousin.

                              <span>When the ageing, silent character you play in puzzle adventure Selfloss performs a roll, it is a tumble of such poignant melancholy I spent the first five minutes of my time with its Steam demo just keeling about in the starting area. It’s a ponderous, pained roll, creaky and ancient. If it has i-frames, the ‘i’ stands for “I would like to not do that again for at least five minutes, please.” Each time you roll, or sprint, your character wipes beads of sweat from his brow, and you can tell the exertion is genuinely taxing. My man is exhausted. Also, surrounded by fish, both symbolic and literal.

                              <span>I mentioned it briefly in my Shadow Of The Erdtree review, but there&#x27;s one area of the DLC where your steed Torrent is so scared they refuse to be summoned. That&#x27;s because said area is a woodland that&#x27;s been steeped in shadow and chaos for so long, large goats don&#x27;t dare clop their hooves. What I hadn&#x27;t expected was that relying on my own two trotters would be so... revelatory. It&#x27;s made me reconsider exploration in Elden Ring&#x27;s open world, and conclude that using Torrent as a taxi service contributes to a feeling of disconnection.

                              <span>Development on slip-slidey FPS Tribes 3: Rivals is set to slow, just months after its early access launch, as developers Prophecy Games say it’s not proving successful enough to &quot;support the studio.&quot;
In a post ominously titled &quot;Tribes 3 Player Update&quot;, Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming &quot;sports shooter&quot; Ultra Strikers. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.

Players are due to be given much more granular control over what scrolls and missives appear on their troubled monarch&#x27;s war table, thanks to the free update that will accompany the Roads To Power DLC. Paradox talk about this and other upcoming changes (including a new start date) in an update post on Steam. Some rulers among you will be excited by all the Byzantine bureaucracy that will headline the DLC. But real kings care about filtering information in extremely picky detail. Still don&#x27;t know why this is big Crusader Kings news? Come with me, you insolent wretch.

                              <span>Live service games such as The First Descendant - a Warframe-ish co-op looter shooter coming next month - can often suffer from a chronic case of numbers-itis, a tragic and goopy disease that stagnates game feel, letting raw and tasteless maths multiply and overwhelm what I, in all my critical wisdom, call “fun button pushy.” Developer NEXON Games were kind enough to answer a few of my questions recently, and most of all, I wanted to know how they’d immunised their endgame against this miserable ailment. The aim, NEXON tell me, is in motivating players to try out different approaches to combat rather than relying on flat progression.

                              <span>Hades 2&#x27;s third early access patch is of the gargantuan variety. It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn&#x27;t change is how sexy the gods are, but because they&#x27;re so sexy anyway, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an issue moving forwards.

                              <span>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it&#x27;s 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that&#x27;d be more at home in a horror game. 
But I&#x27;m also looking forward to the community&#x27;s reaction to the Dragon Age series&#x27; best character creator yet. At the heart …</span>

                              <span>We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation&#x27;s upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we&#x27;re excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game&#x27;s progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we&#x27;ve played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation&#x27;s HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game&#x27;s 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn&#x27;t seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…</span>

                              <span>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.</span>

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002&#x27;s Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game&#x27;s most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, &quot;Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.&quot; However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game&#x27;s campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

                              <span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: &quot;why do AAA games take so long?&quot; It&#x27;s a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service &quot;forever games&quot; over &#x27;finite&#x27;, narrative-led affairs, to the &quot;misleading&quot; announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher&#x27;s brand during a dry spell.
One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah&#x27;s discussion of what he terms &quot;the fidelity death cult&quot; - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and &quot;intricacy&quot;.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there&#x27;s no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It&#x27;s unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we&#x27;re stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…</span>

                              <span>Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that&#x27;s Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country&#x27;s Steam listing simply says the release date is &quot;to be announced.&quot; 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan&#x27;s voice actor, Roger Clark. 
&quot;Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam listing reads. &quot;Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you&#x27;d expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.&quot;
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer&#x27;s Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe&#x27;s next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

                              <span>The one and only Elden Ring expansion we&#x27;re getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn&#x27;t – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads &quot;1.12.2&quot; if it has – select &quot;LOGIN&quot; and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you&#x27;ve previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you&#x27;re encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game&#x27;s system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software&#x27;s Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook&#x27;s body, including things like a Qunari&#x27;s horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class. 


There are three classes to choose from: Rogue, Mage, and Warrior. As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result. Though you’ll be performing things like light and heavy attacks using the same buttons, what those attacks do varies based on your class. For example, a sword-and-shield Warrior can hip-fire or aim their shield to throw it like Captain America, whereas a Mage can use that…</span>

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience. Additionally, it’s made by The Chinese Room, the studio behind multi-awarded titles such as Dear Esther, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. And yet despite these advantages, it still falters when it comes to the fundamental facets.

                              <span>Netflix has announced that Thirsty Suitors, last year’s skateboarding cooking RPG, has joined its roster of games. Additionally, a few new titles, such as The Case of the Golden Idol, are available now on the service.
Thirsty Suitors, a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November. The surreal experience also features skateboarding gameplay and cooking mechanics, with the entire package garnering positive reviews upon release. The move to Netflix Games means it will become available to play on mobile devices for Netflix subscribers. There&#x27;s no date for when Thirsty Suitors arrives on Netflix, but it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon.&quot;


As for new games hitting Netflix this month, acclaimed point-and-click mystery game The Case of the Golden Idol is now available. Joining it is Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit, the Netflix-exclusive sequel to 2021’s Cozy Grove, Hearts, and Netflix Stories: Perfect Match. Subscribers can check out all of these games right now.
Netflix Games has amassed quite the library for itself over the last year or so. Other games to become available on the service include Hades, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy, Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and more.</span>

                              <span>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, the remake of 2010’s Epic Mickey, has a release date. Look for it to arrive on September 24.
The game was first revealed during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game&#x27;s original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:
The full game Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed
A 28 cm Mickey Mouse statue
An Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain
A vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign
Six Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed postcards
A Collector’s Steelbook
The Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack


If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney&#x27;s original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey&#x27;s actions shape his destiny and the game&#x27;s story. 
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey here.</span>

The 2022 interactive documentary is getting an expansion that adds new timelines and 39 games.
This new version of the game is called Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Expanded Edition, and it arrives on October 25. It will be released as DLC to Atari 50 owners and as a standalone title, both digitally and physically. Developer Digital Eclipse (which Atari acquired in 2023) is bolstering the compilation with two new timelines.
First is &quot;The Wider World of Atari&quot;, which features 19 playable games and eight video segments. Topics discussed include Pong creator Al Alcorn discussing the birth of Breakout, a spotlight on ar…</span>

Despite kicking off Nintendo’s fourth-generation console with a starring role in Luigi’s Mansion on GameCube, Luigi&#x27;s sequel always felt a little relegated. He was downgraded to the handheld platform, but it wasn’t because he delivered a bad game. The video game formerly known as Dark Moon has always maintained a positive reputation, but after the success of Luigi’s Mansion 3 on Switch, it felt like part two missed its time to shine. Thankfully, Nintendo and Next Level Games have brought it to console, and while it’s not without its formerly-a-3DS-game quirks, the…</span>

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion&#x27;s release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.
The Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience. When you fight a challenging enemy, it may feel insurmountable, but by taking a studious and persistent …</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

                              <span>E3 is no more, but in its place a new different kind of summer video game show has emerged. It&#x27;s Summer Game Fest... and friends? Geoff Keighley&#x27;s show has become an anchor of sorts for the whole thing, but there is plenty more happening just generally nearby. Whatever we want to call it, it has created a lot of content for our website (and the coming issues of the magazine) and below you will find a nearly comprehensive list of everything we wrote this weekend.

                              <span>Developer Mojang has revealed that a native version of Minecraft is finally coming to PlayStation 5. It&#x27;s currently in a testing phase, but if you own the PlayStation 4 version of the game for your PS5, you can take part in the preview right now. 
Though Minecraft has been playable on PS5 for years, it&#x27;s always been the PS4 version; this native version, however, is a new build of Minecraft made specifically for PS5, which means it will theoretically perform better on the console. 


&quot;Currently, however, the only way to play Minecraft on a PlayStation 5 is by purchasing the PlayStation 4 version of the game,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;By developing a native version of Minecraft for PS5, we&#x27;ll be able to make the game run more effectively on the PS5&#x27;s hardware.&quot; 
Though Mojang hasn&#x27;t revealed how long the Minecraft PS5 version preview will last, all are welcome to take part in it, so long as they own the PS4 version of the game. To access it, go to &quot;Settings&quot; on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select &quot;Preview.&quot; This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. 
Mojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he&#x27;s playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie. After that, read about Netflix&#x27;s animated Minecraft series.

                              <span>In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.
This is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.
If you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.
Now, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)
