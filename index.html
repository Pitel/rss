On 2ch and Twitter, critics have posted examples of what they say proves these charges, which the artist has denied. The criticism has become incessant, and now, some collab goods are being pulled.

According to local anti-piracy sources, a man has now been arrested for offering links to thousands of movies and TV shows including content owned by production companies Toei and Toho.

                    <span>Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has expectedly led to back-and-forth discourse about the likelihood of exclusivity. In response, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed that popular titles like Call of Duty would remain multiplatform. However, at the end of that same statement, Spencer briefly voiced Microsoft&#x27;s interest &quot;in taking similar steps to support Nintendo&#x27;s successful platform.&quot; While this leaves room for interpretation, a recent CNBC interview doubles down on Spencer&#x27;s final remarks meaning Microsoft might bring Call of Duty to Switch. 
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

According to a Eurogamer report, Microsoft&#x27;s President Brad Smith told CNBC, &quot;We&#x27;d like to bring [Call of Duty] to Nintendo devices. We&#x27;d like to bring the other popular titles that Activision Blizzard has, and ensure that they continue to be available on PlayStation, [and] that they become available on Nintendo.&quot; Of course, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that future or current Call of Duty games will be developed with the Switch in mind. Still, Spencer and Smith&#x27;s words might indicate a future where Call of Duty is readily available on every platform.

                    <span>Marvelous Europe and Primal Game Studio have revealed Mandragora, a beautiful and painterly side-scrolling Metroidvania game coming to modern consoles and PC sometime in the future. 
Described by Marvelous as a “story-driven, side-scroller action RPG set in a universe of gorgeous paint strokes and inevitable tragedy,” this game has an art style worth a look. Of course, we don’t know how it plays, but if it feels as good to play as it does to look at it, it’s one we’re excited to check out.

                    <span>Warner Bros. Games has revealed that Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, a mobile game already released in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, is coming to the Americas, Europe, and Oceania territories this year. 
This mobile NetEase-developed title, which Warner Bros. Games describes as a “free-to-play immersive collectible card game and massively multiplayer wizarding dueling game featuring a blend of strategy roleplay,” has been live in China since last September. It’s been received quite well there; it topped local App Stores as the number one game in revenue. So, if this sounds right up your alley and you live in the U.S., Europe, or Oceania, you might have yet another new Harry Potter game to play this year (assuming Hogwarts Legacy is released this year, too).

                    <span>A cracking good time.
Dedicated Nintendo fans may be familiar with the studio Brownie Brown, which was started by ex-Square staff members with credits on the Mana series and has titles like Fantasy Life and Mother 3 to its name. In 2013, Nintendo restructured Brownie Brown into a support studio, which led to its founder Shinichi Kameoka exiting and starting his own studio called, wait for it… Brownies. One of the first projects Brownies produced after its formation was a mobile game called Egglia: Legend of the Redcap, which has now seen a re-release on dedicated gaming platforms as Egglia Rebirth. Stripped of its microtransactions and redesigned for consoles, is Egglia still worth cracking open? Yeah, we’d say it is.
The narrative of Egglia remains simple yet endearing, as it creates a welcoming and friendly world that you can’t help but connect with. You play the role of a redcap goblin—feared by all you meet due to the reputation redcaps have for being incredibly violent. Your character, however, is an amnesiac with his horns chopped off and doesn’t act like such a mean guy, so you soon pull together a small group of allies and begin building a town from which to rebuild the world. Legend of Mana’s influence on the story of Egglia is most immediately apparent in this aspect, as your quest revolves around you collecting and opening eggs that contain small parts of the world which have mysteriously disappeared.

                    <span>Ink and you missed it.
There&#x27;s a secret hidden in Splatoon 3&#x27;s trailer, shown during the February 9th Nintendo Direct — did you spot it? No? Thankfully, someone did. At around 52 seconds into the Salmon Run sneak peek (which you can jump directly to in the trailer above), there&#x27;s a tiny little QR code, right at the top of the screen. And no one knows what it means yet.
A now-deleted Reddit post stated that the release date was hidden within the QR code: The 18th of August, 2022. But that QR code didn&#x27;t match the one in the trailer.

                    <span>Coming in April.
Endflame&#x27;s first-person psychological horror Ikai was originally scheduled for release back in October 2021, but is now arriving on Switch sometime in April. Additionally, in a move that will surely please lovers of the physical article, Numskull Games has confirmed that it&#x27;s publishing physical copies of the game, although only in Europe.
Priced at £34.99 / €39.99, the trailer above gives you a good idea of the kind of horrific time you&#x27;re in for. Set in the feudal era, Ikai draws inspiration from Japanese folklore and tells the story of a priestess battling dark spirits from her past and present. And perhaps future, although the press release doesn&#x27;t mention that.

                    <span>Marvelous Europe is publishing on all platforms.
If you like side-scrolling action games of the Metroidvania variety, Marvelous Europe has announced a new fantasy action-RPG called Mandragora for Switch (and other platforms) which you may want to investigate.
To aid you in your investigations of this self-described &quot;epic and dark fantasy&quot; game from Primal Game Studios, the reveal trailer — age-gated and therefore available to view on YouTube — gives a good idea of what to expect from its painterly 2.5D world: lovely-looking vistas, dank dungeons, hulking beasties, and heavy weaponry to swing their way. The trailer is worth watching, if only for the bit at the end where the knight chap starts pulling on a plant and, true to the game&#x27;s title, things takes a turn for the screamy. We never were a fan of mandrake-y things.

                    <span>&quot;It&#x27;s not unheard of for people to go out of those meetings crying&quot;.
Veteran publisher Team17 found itself in the spotlight recently due to its aborted plans to create a series of NFTs based on the Worms franchise, and this increased exposure has led to a scathing report on the working environment and business practices at the firm.
The thorough and enlightening report by Eurogamer unearths stories of poor pay, overworked staff and low morale, as well as a critical portrayal of Team17 boss, Debbie Bestwick. Eurogamer spoke to several past and present Team17 staffers, who understandably chose to remain anonymous to protect their careers and future prospects.

                    <span>It was certainly packed with reveals.
This week we had the first major Nintendo Direct of the year and, well, it was packed with surprises and reveals. It&#x27;s clear that Nintendo has also successfully plugged most — if not all — leaks, with quite a few of the announcements not appearing beforehand with the usual rumours and speculation; the show was all the more fun for it, too.
With 30 games featured in the western broadcasts, it was almost frantic in terms of announcements (especially in the first 10 minutes), and there was a mix of older franchises being revived alongside current big-hitters. There was also a rather charming segment that reminded us of the Iwata-san era of Directs, in which our hosts loosened up and demonstrated a bit of Nintendo Switch Sports. Shinya Takahashi and Yoshiaki Koizumi were conscious of not overstaying their welcome and quick to return to new announcements, serving up a well-judged slice of old-school Nintendo levity that we enjoyed very much.

The rights to make video games based on J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy world of Middle-earth are going up for sale, Variety has reported.
The Saul Zaentz Company has decided to sell its Tolkien holdings, which are expected to fetch around $2 billion at auction. Founded by the late Saul Zaentz, who passed away in 2017, the company owns the rights to exploit The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit – Tolkien&#x27;s most famous books – in film, video games, merchandising, live events and theme parks.

Inkle – the studio behind 80 Days and Heaven&#x27;s Vault – has just announced that its next game, A Highland Song, is coming to Switch.
It&#x27;s described as a &quot;narrative adventure with rhythm and survival elements&quot; and places you in the shoes of Scottish teen Moira McKinnon, who has never seen the sea and runs away from her home in the highlands to view it for the first time after &quot;receiving a letter from her Uncle Hamish urging her to come to the coast.&quot;

Originally made by Intelligent Systems — the same Nintendo-exclusive team behind the Fire Emblem series — this remake of the first two entries on the Game Boy Advance is being handled by WayForward, developer of the Shantae series and specialists when it comes to revisiting older properties.

Pop legend Rick Astley has sold around 40 million records globally and has unintentionally spawned one of the most annoying memes on the planet, but the question on everyone&#x27;s lips (well, maybe just ours) has to be: &quot;what&#x27;s his favourite video game?&quot;
Turns out that Rick has excellent taste because his favourite game is GoldenEye 007 on the N64. Speaking to Metro back in 2021 (sorry, we only just spotted this thanks to Daniel Major&#x27;s recent retweet), Astley – whose hits include &quot;Together Forever&quot;, &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot; and, of course, the legendary &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; – was asked about this all-time fave video game, and replied:

                    <span>But it&#x27;s still not cheap.
First 4 Figures is known for its truly stunning collection of figures and statues – check out our photo gallery of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s Link if you don&#x27;t believe us – and its latest is available to pre-order as we speak.
The star, as you may have already guessed, is none other than Conker of Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day fame. The iconic N64 hero&#x27;s available in three editions: Standard, Exclusive, and Definitive. As always, though, these things aren&#x27;t cheap.

Microsoft president Brad Smith has said that it wants to bring the Call of Duty series to Switch, assuming its purchase of Activision Blizzard goes ahead as planned.
Smith made the comments in an interview with CNBC, in which he once again made clear that Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard would not prevent its games from coming to Sony and Nintendo&#x27;s platforms.

                    <span>Ah, the &#x27;90s.
After lots of waiting Nintendo finally delivered what a number of Nintendo Switch Online subscribers have demanded - EarthBound and EarthBound Beginnings were released on the NES and SNES apps. Nintendo didn&#x27;t go above and beyond and deliver us a localised iteration of Mother 3, sadly, but titles that were previously individual purchases on the Wii U eShop are now part of the standard online subscription.
Of the two EarthBound is the one that was most desired, and Nintendo is once again sharing the full Player&#x27;s Guide from back in the day. It&#x27;s a real nostalgia trip (those &#x27;90s fonts!) and well over a hundred pages, so it&#x27;s well worth a look.

Update: The first one is already live. Here are the full patch notes from Nintendo&#x27;s official support page:
Ver. 2.0.0 (Released February 9, 2022)
New Difficulties Available

&quot;ROOKIE MODE&quot; has been added to the game. This is a mode suited towards new players, with the following adjustments:
Dropped items from enemies now replenish greater amounts when picked-up.
Damage received from Boss attacks has been lowered.
Destructible Boss projectiles have been made easier to break than usual (excluding some attacks).
Increased number of missiles available when beginning game.
Made the finishing counters when defeating some Bosses easier to perform.
Selected when starting a New Game, and choosing &quot;SELECT DIFFICULTY&quot;.


“DREAD MODE” has been added to the game. This is an extremely high-difficulty mode, where any damage taken from enemies or traps will lead to an instant Game Over.
Can be selected after clearing HARD MODE, when beginning a New Game, and choosing “SELECT DIFFICULTY”.


New Details Added to Results Screen

Several new details have been added to the results screen that appears after clearing the game. These new details will not appear, however, for game files that were started prior to updating the game.

General Fixes

Fixed an issue where Samus sliding down a surface and touching a frozen enemy would force the game to close, after the message “The software was closed because an error occurred” appears.
Made several other fixes to improve playability and enjoyment of game.

Demo Update
The following updates to the “Metroid Dread DEMO” are also now available (Ver. 2.0.0).

                    <span>One of the recurring FOSDEM talks we have come to enjoy has been Oracle&#x27;s Daniel Kiper providing an annual update on the GRUB bootloader development efforts.

                    <span>Inspired by how much Matthew made me laugh with his withering assessment of the MacGuffin in the film Red Notice being an egg, this week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is all MacGuffin, all the time. We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.
We discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry &quot;Vitamin H&quot; Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it&#x27;s because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!

                    <span>Freaky sci-fi shooter Atomic Heart has often been as mysterious as the Soviet research base-cum-house of robot horrors it takes place in. It looks like the four-year wait for answers will end this year, though: a new story trailer ends with confirmation of a 2022 launch, apparently in a month ending in “ber”. As in, “#######ber” literally pops up on screen. There’s your release window, puzzle fans.

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that rapper Rick Ross is richer than he&#x27;s ever been. That&#x27;s according to a song from his latest album: &quot;Richer Than I Ever Been&quot;. He may be referring to his own pockets, but it can&#x27;t be a coincidence that he&#x27;s perfectly summed up yet another of my early hands-on sessions with FromSoftware&#x27;s action-RPG Elden Ring.
That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve now been able to return to the starting area of Limgrave, this time on PC and with unfettered access to all the nooks and crannies we&#x27;ll be exploring in just a couple of weeks time - and I found it to be richer and more vast than, well, it had ever been. FromSoftware have tweaked some things and removed some barriers from last year&#x27;s closed network test, so in a single six-hour excavation, I discovered just how ambitious this game really is. Limgrave is way bigger than I first thought. Here&#x27;s what I found.

                    <span>The serious security hole affecting PvP in the whole Dark Souls series on PC should not be a problem with Elden Ring, Bandai Namco have announced. In January, they took all Dark Souls PvP servers offline following the publicisation of an remote code execution exploit which let wrong&#x27;uns run commands on other players&#x27; computers. Some feared this hole might be present in Elden Ring too. Bamco now say that Elden Ring is fine, but those Dark Souls servers won&#x27;t come back down until after FromSoftware&#x27;s new game launches.

Originally released in 1999, the JRPG is coming to PC (and some consoles) as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition with new updated 3D character models, some new 2D art, a &quot;refined&quot; soundtrack, and other tweaky bits. It looks better than many of the garbage PC ports they were releasing a few years ago. Check out the trailer yourself below.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is quite the hardware fiend, hence why enabling DLSS – provided your GPU supports it – is so useful for keeping frame rates up. Sadly, in both the review build I tested and at launch, even the highest quality DLSS setting looked uncharacteristically lower-res. It was still worth using, especially if you fancied clambering over Villedor’s rooftops at 4K or with ray tracing effects, but there was a nagging sense that DLSS can do better. And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions.

                    <span>A planned expansion for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is instead being spun off into its own separate standalone game, a new report claims. The unnamed and unannounced game supposedly stars chaotic frenemy Basim, and will be more a smaller stealth-focused game rather than another rambling open-world murder-o-rama. But are we talking stealth-stealth, or Assassin&#x27;s Creed stealth, or modern Ubisoft stealth?

Jak možná víte, Log4j je široce používaný programovací rámec, který zaznamenává aktivitu uživatelů a chování aplikací. Je to nástroj, který se obrovsky rozšířil, hojně se využívá – a také je hlavním viníkem řady bezpečnostních incidentů a ztráty dat.</span>

                    <span>Procedurally-generated space odyssesy No Man’s Sky becomes a pocket universe this summer when it heads to Switch, per today’s Nintendo Direct.
The Switch version doesn’t offer any drastic differences from its console and PC counterparts. The game includes every update to hit the game throughout its lifetime. That’s five years worth of additions which include base-building, multiplayer, creature-taming, underwater exploration, and much more. It’s come a long way since its infamous 2016 launch, which is one of the reasons we included it as one of the best open-world games available now.

There’s no release date for the Switch version but Hello Games will hopefully narrow that down soon.</span>

During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we got a few surprises. Among them was Disney Speedstorm, a &quot;hero-based&quot; combat racing game where you can take iconic Disney and Pixar characters and turn them into road warriors. The lineup includes Captain Jack Sparrow, Mulan, Mickey Mouse, Monsters Inc.&#x27;s Sulley, the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, and more (fingers crossed for Wreck-It Ralph). As you play, you can upgrade each character’s stats and utilize their unique skills. 
“To work on a dream project like Disney Speedstorm, we are driven to create a game that feels like home for Disney and Pixar fans but is also unique to the arcade-racing genre. The gameplay mechanics, the racer abilities and the location design were all tailored to serve our vision of a fast and gripping competitive experience.” says Gameloft Barcelona VP &amp; studio manager Alexandru “Sasha” Adam. “We can’t wait to share this vision with players around the globe.” 
Publisher Gameloft, promises that Disney Speedstorm will get updated with new racers and courses regularly, and support cross-platform play when it launches free-to-play on PC and consoles sometime this year.</span>

                    <span>Everyone knows about Mario Kart; it’s an arcade-racing staple that people of all backgrounds and ages have enjoyed for decades. So, it’s no surprise that fans are still taking to the high-speed tracks of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe almost five years after its initial launch. Luckily, more content/support is coming that will make the eighth entry feel like a brand new chapter in the Kart-racing franchise. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass is on the way and promises a whopping 48 extra courses by 2023.

These courses will release in six total waves, with the first wave dropping on March 18. Wave 1 includes an exciting mixture of classic and recent maps like Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. If you already have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion membership, you’ll get instant access to the Booster Course Pass when the first wave is available in a few months. You can also pre-order it for $25.
We loved Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as much as its dedicated fandom. Brian Shea concluded his review by saying: 
“Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is primarily a re-release of an acclaimed game from three years ago, but by adding new content and addressing the biggest complaint of the original, this version is unquestionably the best way to experience Nintendo&#x27;s great racer. Battle mode is back to its original glory, and when combined with the rest of the robust Mario Kart 8 package, it creates a great addition to the fledgling Switch library.”

                    <span>Wii Sports revolutionized Nintendo&#x27;s console business when it came bundled with every Wii console. That compilation disc included five rudimentary sports titles and showed players the capabilities of the Wii&#x27;s then-groundbreaking motion controls. It was an immediate smash hit, attracting demographics that extended far beyond Nintendo&#x27;s typical gaming audience. However, while the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the wildly popular Wii and it has its fair share of wide-reaching smash hits like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the console/handheld hybrid hasn&#x27;t had another transcendent game experience like the original Wii Sports. Now, with the aptly named Nintendo Switch Sports, fans of Wii Sports can relive past glories.
Nintendo Switch Sports gathers six sports and lets you control them using the motion controls of the Switch Joy-Cons. Tennis, bowling, and chambara (swordplay) all return to the Sports series, while this iteration adds soccer, volleyball, and badminton. If you buy the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports, you also receive a Leg Strap accessory that allows your Joy-Con to track your leg, which can be used in soccer&#x27;s Shootout Mode.
You can play in-person with family and friends like the original Wii Sports or play online in ranked matchmaking or against friends on your Nintendo Switch Online list. Two free updates were also announced for Nintendo Switch Sports. The first one, coming this summer, adds the ability to use the Leg Strap peripheral for the main game of soccer. This fall, another free update will add golf to the collection of sports you can play.
Nintendo Switch Sports arrives on Switch on April 29. If you&#x27;d like to check it out before then, Nintendo is hosting a special online play test from February 18 to 20, where Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can play bowling, chambara, and tennis.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s rare that we get big Nintendo Directs like the 40-minute presentation today, and it&#x27;s even rarer that we get any Earthbound news. Nintendo announced the SNES classic Earthbound is finally making its way to Switch, and its NES prequel dubbed Earthbound Beginnings will be joining it.
Earthbound will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection, being added to the service for no additional cost. Likewise, Earthbound Beginnings will become a new part of the Switch&#x27;s NES collection. 
For those unfamiliar with Earthbound, it&#x27;s a 1994 JRPG that follows a small-town boy named Ness who is tasked by a time-traveling bee to save the world from an alien invasion. Along his travels across the globe, he meets plenty of strange characters and forms a party with three other very capable children. In Japan, it&#x27;s known as Mother 2, although it&#x27;s the first of the series that made its way stateside.
Earthbound Beginnings is the original Mother title that didn&#x27;t see release outside of Japan for 16 years. The 1989 JRPG was localized and released on Wii U in 2015. Like Earthbound, you play as a seemingly normal kid named Ninten with psychic powers who goes on a strange adventure. This is the second time Earthbound Beginnings has been made available, skipping release on 3DS and the NES Classic.
Hopefully, the release of these absolute classics will open the door for Mother 3 to see the light of day outside of Japan in some way. Start your prayer circles for the next Nintendo Direct.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the long-awaited sequel to 2017&#x27;s Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and it is scheduled to hit Switch this September. 
Closing out today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came as quite a surprise. That&#x27;s because it showed a lot of imagery that looked similar to Xenoblade Chronicles X, the spin-off to the first Xenoblade Chronicles. Considering that&#x27;s one of the last big Wii U games that hasn&#x27;t yet been ported to the Switch, it seemed possible that today&#x27;s direct was finally revealing that port. However, that&#x27;s not the case because Nintendo and Monolith Soft are ready to move forward in the story with a threequel.

                    <span>Have you vanquished Metroid Dread but are itching to push your skills to the limit? Conversely, do you find the game too difficult and want a more laid-back experience? Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct revealed that the game has a free update on the way that adds modes to make Samus&#x27; adventure on ZDR as tough or chill as you&#x27;d like.
For hardcore players, there&#x27;s Dread Mode. This dastardly option makes it so that taking a single hit means instant death. Rookie Mode, on the other hand, increases the amount of health Samus&#x27; replenishes when picking up restorative items. The update goes live later today (with the free demo getting updated to include it), so you can download it soon if Dread is kicking your butt or not making you sweat enough. 
Nintendo also announced that a Boss Rush mode, where you battle bosses continually one after another, will arrive via a second update sometime in April.

                    <span>Today’s Nintendo Direct brought the surprising announcement that Live A Live is making its way to the West for the first time ever. The 1994 Super Famicom game was developed by Square and has never been officially released outside of Japan, making this a welcomed development for JRPG aficionados.
Live A Live is getting an Octopath Traveler-style facelift, sporting the same HD-2D art direction. The game stars eight heroes and is told through eight scenarios set during different time periods such as prehistory, imperial China, the Wild West, the distant future, and more. You tackle these stories in any order, and each sports a unique gameplay hook, such as stealth or telepathy. Live A Live launches for Switch on July 22.

                    <span>A new Triangle Strategy demo is coming to the Nintendo eshop today on Switch, as announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. Now, I know we&#x27;ve already had a chance to check out the Final Fantasy Tactics-style combat and social engineering political strategy in an earlier demo, but this new demo? Players can experience the game all the way until the end of chapter 3 during this demo. Probably even more relevant, progress from this demo is going to carry over into the full release!
So if you want to try out some classes and see how they perform in battle or flit around with different story strategies as to what nation you&#x27;re trying to help or hinder, this is the time. Or you could just try to get a super overpowered class composition and be ready for launch. You do you, ya know? Oh, and for those that haven&#x27;t played, this is a good chance to see what the game is all about!</span>

                    <span>Players of the original Chrono Cross have long praised it as one of the standout role-playing games of its time. Inventive characters, an intriguing dimension-hopping story, and incredibly memorable music made it a game that has stuck in the memory of gamers even decades after its original release back in 1999. The fondness players have for the series hasn’t been lost on those who hold its rights, as Square Enix has just announced that a remaster, entitled Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, is on the way to the Nintendo Switch.
And whether you played the original and can’t wait to play an updated version, or you’re looking forward to enjoying Serge’s adventure for the first time, you won’t have long to wait. The remastered RPG is hitting on April 7 and will also be available on Pl…</span>

                    <span>Valve&#x27;s landmark puzzlers, Portal and its sequel, Portal 2, are coming to the Nintendo Switch, as announced today during Nintendo&#x27;s most recent Direct livestream. 
In terms of the releases, the Portal Companion Collection seems to be just that: both games in one package. The brief announcement trailer did not specify any new content coming to the games, aside from the change in platform. Nevertheless, playing the Portal games in handheld mode seems novel. 
Check out the trailer here:

No release date was given for Companion Collection, though the trailer did announce the games will be released &quot;this year.&quot; 
For those keeping track, the Companion Collection is actually the first Valve game to be released on a Nintendo platform. The timing is somewhat coincidental, since Valve&#x27;s own Switch-like console, the Steam Deck, is set to launch in a couple of weeks.</span>

                    <span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming on March 25. In today&#x27;s trailer shown during the latest Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at some of Kirby&#x27;s abilities in the game. 
As you&#x27;d expect, they involve him sucking items up and transforming based on what he swallowed. This ability is known as Kirby&#x27;s Mouthful Mode, and when he sucks up something like a car, for example, Car Mouth is activated. In Car Mode, Kirby can race around the level, ramming through any enemies in his way.

The trailer revealed many other mouth forms like Vending Mouth, which sees Kirby suck up a vending machine that allows him to shoot juice cans at enemies, Cone Mouth, which lets him spike down on something after sucking up a cone, and more. There&#x27;s also Scissor-lift Mouth, Ring Mouth, Light-Bulb Mouth, Arch Mouth, and even Water-Balloon Mouth. 
That&#x27;s not everything shown in the trailer, though. We got a look at Waddle Dee Town, which is where Waddle Dee lives and home to Waddle Dee&#x27;s Weapon Shop. Here, you can purchase items and evolutions like the Cutter and Chakram Cutter, Volcano Fire, Clutter Needle, Gigant Sword, Noble Ranger, Frosty Ice, and Toy Hammer. You&#x27;ll need all of these and more to successfully make your way through Kirby&#x27;s latest adventure in Kirby and the Forgotten Land. 
Fortunately, you don&#x27;t have to wait much longer to play this game because it hits Switch on March 25. While waiting for that, read about why Kirby and the Forgotten Land might be the cutest post-apocalypse ever, and then watch this trailer released last month that showcases Kirby&#x27;s copy abilities and the game&#x27;s co-op mode. Read about how Nintendo has plans to celebrate Kirby&#x27;s 30th anniversary in other ways this year after that.

                    <span>During today’s 40-minute long Nintendo Direct, we got a glimpse at Splatoon 3’s frenetic cooperative multiplayer mode.

As per the trailer, four players are dropped onto an abandoned rig surrounded by hideous water creatures hell-bent on bringing the squad to its knees. The cutesy aesthetic of the Splatoon series is juxtaposed marvelously with the foreboding blood-red skyline, dissonant music, and tense third-person combat. Players get pitted against several powerful bosses in a wave-based system where the challenge increases depending on success. You’ll have to use your various paintball guns to slow down/vanquish enemies, transfer essential items like eggs to safe areas, and transform into an array of paint-spewing mechs. If you’ve got what it takes, maybe you’ll even get the chance to take on the Giant Salmon. 
Splatoon 3 launches sometime this summer for Nintendo Switch.</span>

Announced at today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, a remake of Front Mission 2 has also been announced to come to Switch at a later point in the future. Check out the entire announcement trailer below!

Front Mission is an interesting choice to resurrect into relevancy in 2022. If you ever wanted to dive into tactical RPG mech combat, Front Mission might be the place to do it. Position and move your troops around the battlefield and strategically target the opponent&#x27;s various Wanzer points to gain the edge in combat. Blast off arms, legs, and other smart targets to take your enemies out quickly – or deny them access to their dangerous weapons. For all the love the series has, many Front Mission titles are not released outside of Japan. Perhaps this remake will bring some more attention to the mechanized warfare franchise!</span>

                    <span>After suffering a delay from its original December 2021 release, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct confirmed that Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp arrives on April 8. 
This collection bundles rebuilt versions of Advance Wars 1 and 2 that feature new 3D graphics and, as announced today, full voice-acting. In addition to conquering rival armies in the game’s two campaigns, you can also create your own stages using a map editor or take on up to three other players in Versus Mode +. 
The game was first announced during E3 2021. The Advance Wars series earned acclaim on Game Boy Advance for its steller take on turn-based strategy, but the series has been on hiatus since the Nintendo DS era. Hopefully Re-Boot Camp signals a bigger return for the beloved strategy franchise.

                    <span>Today during Nintendo&#x27;s latest Direct presentation, the company announced Mario Strikers: Battle League, a new entry in the series with an action-focused take on soccer. The game will be released on June 10, though pre-orders are available now. 
Twisting the original sport, Battle League pits two teams of five against each other to – as you might expect – score more goals than the opposing team. While the game can be played alone, it also features up to eight-player multiplayer and the ability to join online soccer leagues.

Also shown in the trailer are all of the gear options, which change and improve player stats. Taking a cue from other Nintendo-themed sports games, Battle League encourages players to use various attacks against their opponents – including, but not limited to, tackles, shell attacks, and &quot;hyper strikes,&quot; which appear to be very powerful attacks. 
Nintendo announced pre-orders for Battle League are available today. The game will be released for the Nintendo Switch on June 10.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo has revealed Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, which, as the name implies, is a Three Houses take on the Musou Warriors spinoff.
Fire Emblem Warriors was first released back in 2017, and it was the first Warriors game set in the universe of Fire Emblem. It&#x27;s back in Three Hopes, which will bring Byleth, Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and all of your favorite students and teachers from Three Houses back for the fight. Despite having the &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors&quot; name, this is not DLC – it&#x27;s a brand-new game. It will be released on June 24 on the Nintendo Switch, so you won&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now.

As for what to expect, Three Hopes sees the characters of the mainline Fire Emblem: Three Houses game return in a Musou format. If you&#x27;re not familiar with that genre, you control a character who essentially wrecks through dozens of enemies at a time. It won&#x27;t feature Fire Emblem&#x27;s rock-paper-scissors combat as a result and will be much more action-focused. 
As you&#x27;d expect with the name, in this Warriors game, you&#x27;ll be fighting enemies at the Monastery, on familiar battlefields, and more. It&#x27;s unclear when in the timeline of Three Houses this game takes place. Those familiar with the original game can probably suss out when this game takes place, considering some of the events of that narrative. Only time will tell. 
While waiting for its June 24 release, read Game Informer&#x27;s Fire Emblem Warriors review and check out Game Informer&#x27;s Fire Emblem: Three Houses review.

On the surface, it looks like a very good driving AI and if you’re anything like me, you’ve had your butt kicked by AI drivers in the likes of Need for Speed, Dirt, and even Gran Turismo before. However, Sony’s presentation today, which included speakers from Polyphony Digital including Gran Turismo 7 producer Kazunori Yamauchi, showcased just how great Sophy is at Gran Turismo.

                    <span>When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher&#x27;s other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. 
Though pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil&#x27;s statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:
In short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they&#x27;re not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. 
As a reminder, assuming Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn&#x27;t expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it&#x27;s good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.</span>

Trying to predict what will be at these Nintendo Directs is like trying to catch Togetic with a Lead Ball in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. While the publishing giant hasn&#x27;t said what titles will make an appearance during the longer 40 minute direct, we can venture some guesses given what we know of the company&#x27;s upcoming lineup. We know Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fit within that timeframe, so it would make sense to get new looks at the exciting new Switch titles. 
Nintendo has also been steadily dropping new N64 games for Switch Online. A Direct would be a good time to continue that trend (here&#x27;s hoping for Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap to celebrate the upcoming Pokémon Day on February 27). Will any of the games I listed in the first paragraph make an appearance? Probably not, or maybe yes? You&#x27;ll just have to tune in live at 3:30 p.m. CT to find out.

Trying to predict what will be at these Nintendo Directs is like trying to catch Togetic with a Lead Ball in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. While the publishing giant hasn&#x27;t said what titles will make an appearance during the longer 40 minute direct, we can venture some guesses given what we know of the company&#x27;s upcoming lineup. We know Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fit within that timeframe, so it would make sense to get new looks at the exciting new Switch titles. 
Nintendo has also been steadily dropping new N64 games for Switch Online. A Direct would be a good time to continue that trend (here&#x27;s hoping for Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap to celebrate the upcoming Pokémon Day on February 27). Will any of the games I listed in the first paragraph make an appearance? Probably not, or maybe yes? You&#x27;ll just have to tune in live at 3:30 p.m. CT to find out.

                    <span>During a special livestream hosted by Geoff Keighly, The Wolf Among Us 2&#x27;s first trailer premiered along with a release window of 2023. Keighly sat down with Telltale&#x27;s designers and voice actors to spill the beans on what&#x27;s in store for the long-awaited second season.

The Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the first season, still well before the Fables comic series it&#x27;s based on. Bigby Wolf (Adam Herrington) has been suspended from his role as sheriff of Fabletown by his new boss Snow White (Erin Yvette), who has become the deputy mayor overseeing a reformed administration. Cut loose and in anger management, Telltale says much of the tale revolves around Bigby having to discover his own definitions of good and evil as he meets a New York City detective and assists them on a difficult new case. Players can expect to bump into returning faces and newcomers, including characters from The Wizard of Oz, such as the Scarecrow and Tin Man. 
The game has been rebuilt in Unreal instead of Telltale&#x27;s old gameplay engine. Telltale wouldn&#x27;t divulge gameplay specifics, only saying it would be rooted in the foundation of season 1 with some new additions. The trailer primarily shows scenes from Episode 1, and The Wolf Among Us will consist of five episodes total. Telltale also confirmed the sequel is in full production after spending the last couple of years in the pre-planning phase. 
The Wolf Among Us 2 was first announced during The Game Awards 2019, though it had initially been in the works by the original Telltale Games before the studios&#x27; closure in 2018. The game was canceled after the shutdown but then restarted by the revived version of Telltale. You can learn the full story of how the new Telltale rose from the ashes of its predecessor by reading this deep-dive feature. 
You can play The Wolf Among Us 2 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as an Epic Store exclusive.</span>

Original story, 2/8/22:
Battlefield 2042 is still in the midst of a rough post-launch period. An abundance of game-breaking bugs and a lack of new content have disillusioned the franchise&#x27;s long-time fans and turned off newcomers. Despite the game&#x27;s ongoing issues, a dedicated player base does exist, but the activity numbers have waned since release. To make matters worse, a Battlefield 2042 refund p…</span>

                    <span>A few months in, Halo Infinite has carved out a place in my regular gaming schedule. I had a lot to praise about the game in my original review, in which I wrote about the ways that this newest Halo nimbly walks the line between nostalgia for the earlier games and a fresh, modern core. I’ve been surprised that the multiplayer component has kept me so engaged for as many weeks as it has; as many have observed, the small number of map selections and modes can be limiting, but I still find myself coming back for more of that wonderful “dance” of competition that the Halo competitive experience offers in its best moments. Nonetheless, as the weeks wear on, the challenge system that sits on top of that competition feels deeply flawed, and the passage of time is only making the problems more app…</span>

                    <span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a mobile prequel to the 2018 RPG that launched in Japan in October 2020. It became wildly popular overseas and now Octopath fans in the west will have their chance to see why when the English version arrives this year.
Champions of the Continent plays similarly to the original title. The turn-based field command system remains but up to eight characters can take the battlefield instead of only four. Naturally, the game retains the original’s signature HD-2D art style. 
Story-wise, the game still takes place on the continent of Osterra. The narrative has three paths starring Herminia the &quot;Witch of Greed&quot;, Tytos the &quot;Hero&quot;, and Auguste the &quot;Playwright&quot;. Each character is on a journey to find wealth, power, and glory, respectively, and whoever you choose acts as a Chosen One fighting against a great evil. Fans of the first Octopath Traveler can expect to bump into familiar faces from that game as well. 
OCTOPATH TRAVELER: Champions of the Continent (English ver.) will launch in North America and Europe in 2022!

Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent is a free-to-play title with microtransactions; new characters are obtained using standard gacha-style mechanics. The game launches on iOS and Android in North America and Europe sometime in 2022 with a closed beta beginning in Spring. New information is expected to drop in “mid-February” on the game’s newly launched Facebook page. 
Until then, Octopath’s spiritual tactical follow-up Triangle Strategy is on the horizon, releasing on March 4.</span>

Today fans are in for a treat, though, as we finally get to see what&#x27;s behind the curtain on The Wolf Among Us 2 as we react live with you on Twitch.

                    <span>Being 16 years old is hard enough. There’s school as well as dynamic changes in friendships and other relationships. For some, it’s when you get a job and start making money. Parker Anderson, the one-man show behind PlugWorld, took on all of that and began developing a game that you can play with one hand all by himself. He’s now 17 years old, and Weaponeer is nearing its big (paid) re-release on February 14. 
While Anderson developed the game exclusively by himself, its re-release features a few extra helping hands in the form of VoxPop Games and charity AbleGamers. VoxPop was founded during the COVID-19 pandemic by current CEO Charles Yu and COO Marc Rodriguez. Yu jumped into game development shortly after college, working in quality assurance in the Apple App Store ecosystem and elsewhe…</span>

From Software has revealed that the online servers for its Dark Souls suite of games on PC will remain offline until the launch of Elden Ring. 
Last month, From Software revealed that a PC exploit had been discovered in its suite of Dark Souls games that could give control of your PC over to someone else. That obviously presents a whole host of problems and From Software responded by taking the PC Dark Souls games – so Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 – offline. Now, you could still play the game solo, but the online components were taken offline and From Software has revealed that their servers will remain offline until after the release of Elden Ring later this month.

This beta, which kicks off today for those who have signed up for PlayStation’s beta program, is the PS5’s second and it’s only available to those in the U.S. and U.K. Of course, since this is just a beta, it doesn’t necessarily mean the rest of the world will see these options. Considering the test-like nature of this beta program, there’s the possibility that participants don’t like everything they see, which might cause PlayStation to change some things up. Only time will tell for now, though.

                    <span>Horizon Forbidden West is right around the corner – it hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on February 18 – and while there are plenty of trailers to watch in the meantime, there’s some new Aloy-inspired content waiting for you in Ghost of Tsushima. 
Developer Sucker Punch Productions has announced that a new patch for its samurai action-adventure game, Ghost of Tsushima, brings with it a new armor set hidden on Iki Island. To the north of the game’s newest island, you’ll find a Wind Shrine with a puzzle for you to solve. Solve it and you’ll receive a new Aloy-inspired armor. 
We are so excited for Horizon Forbidden West from our friends at @Guerrilla! While we wait, today we’ve released a new patch for Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut that repairs a Wind Shrine to the north of Iki Island. Solve the puzzle there to earn an Aloy-inspired surprise... pic.twitter.com/5brcjTvL7o
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, solving this new Iki Island Wind Shrine gives protagonist Jin Sakai an armor set that resembles something Aloy might wear in the Horizon games. That’s not all, though. This patch also brings a new Platinum difficulty option to the Survival mode in Ghost of Tsushima Legends, the multiplayer arm of the game. Plus, the patch fixes an issue that causes brief stuttering during gameplay. 
While waiting for this patch to download, be sure to read about everything that’s new in Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut and check out our breakdown of everything we already know about Horizon Forbidden West. Be sure to watch the latest Horizon Forbidden West trailer that showcases challenges, arenas, salvage contracts, and more after that.

Developer Sucker Punch Productions has announced that a new patch for its samurai action-adventure game, Ghost of Tsushima, brings with it a new armor set hidden on Iki Island. To the north of the game’s newest island, you’ll find a Wind Shrine with a puzzle for you to solve. Solve it and you’ll receive a new Aloy-inspired armor. 
We are so excited for Horizon Forbidden West from our friends at @Guerrilla! While we wait, today we’ve released a new patch for Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut that repairs a Wind Shrine to the north of Iki Island. Solve the puzzle there to earn an Aloy-inspired surprise... pic.twitter.com/5brcjTvL7o
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, solving this new Iki Island Wind Shrine gives protagonist Jin Sakai an armor set that resembles something Aloy might wear in the Horizon games. That’s not all, though. This patch also brings a new Platinum difficulty option to the Survival mode in Ghost of Tsushima Legends, the multiplayer arm of the game. Plus, the patch fixes an issue that causes brief stuttering during gameplay. 
While waiting for this patch to download, be sure to read about everything that’s new in Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut and check out our breakdown of everything we already know about Horizon Forbidden West. Be sure to watch the latest Horizon Forbidden West trailer that showcases challenges, arenas, salvage contracts, and more after that.

                    <span>Update: Boba Fett has assembled an army in his Disney+ series, and his hired help is also following him into Fortnite. If you venture into the game&#x27;s item shop today, you can purchase skins of Boba Fett&#x27;s trusted right hand, Fennec Shand, and the wookiee bounty hunter, Krrsantan.
You can also purchase Fennec&#x27;s starship as a glider and a &quot;This is the way&quot; emote that audibly says the famous line. All of these skins and items are offered in a bundle for a reduced price. Like all licensed skins, these won&#x27;t be in the shop for long before being retired. If you missed out on Boba Fett the first time around, he&#x27;s back with his Firespray glider. You can also add a stormtrooper to your ranks.
If you&#x27;ve been watching The Book of Boba Fett, you&#x27;ll probably want to see more characters from the show ma…</span>

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

                    <span>In 1999, the US Army reasoned that if children enjoyed shooting people in video games, perhaps they could be encouraged to later shoot people in real life too. Thus began America&#x27;s Army, a series of tactical first-person shooters funded and released for free by the Army as a recruitment tool. But the series has seemingly petered out and now they&#x27;re preparing to end support for the latest, America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds. Official servers will shut down in May, though offline bits and privately owned servers will remain playable.

Desktop monitors are trying it out as well, like the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX: the very first Mini LED gaming monitor on the market when it launched late last year. As a 32in, 4K, 144Hz display, it does all it can to welcome Mini LED into high-end gamingland, and from what I’ve tested it’s a brilliant match. All you have to do first is spend what could well be several times the cost of your PC itself.

You haven’t seen his eagerness, his joie de vivre, as he swings between the many improbably-convenient floating grapple hook platforms of the world. You haven’t witnessed the plucky determination with which he clambers up wall after wall, no matter how many times he’s climbed them before. You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab. 


By the end of my seven hours with Grapple Dog, I wanted to strangle the bastard with his own goddamn hook.

                    <span>Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like &#x27;destiny&#x27;, and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don&#x27;t particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. 
For example, I&#x27;m pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger&#x27;s quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.

The organisers today announced the Commonwealth Esports Championships, running in August alongside the main event. And maybe it&#x27;ll lead to more esports?

                    <span>The RPS video chamber has been a little quiet since Colm left us at the end of last year, but this week I&#x27;m pleased to announce that strange noises have once again been heard from deep within our Treehouse recording booth. Indeed, our search for a new vid bud is finally over, so please say hello and welcome to Liam Richardson.

Last week, I noticed my hand was sore. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, mostly because I wasn&#x27;t sure why it would be hurting. On Monday, while playing OlliOlli World, I found my reason. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a better way to recommend World than that; it pushed my hands to their limit. 
Compared to the previous two OlliOlli games, which could be prohibitively difficult, World is simultaneously an easy-to-approach 2D skateboarding game with an impossibly high skill ceiling. Early on, the game does a great job quickly teaching you …</span>

                    <span>Lost Ark launches for Western audiences this week, with its three-day early access event starting today. Amazon Games, the publisher bringing Tripod Studios and Smilegate&#x27;s RPG to the west, has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server, so I&#x27;ve had my hands on the action-RPG MMO for a few weeks now. Much of the game was in place when I played, although I was missing a very big aspect of it: the broader social component. Because of the small sample size of players, all of my time in the world of Arkesia was by my lonesome. So, for now, I&#x27;m not comfortable dropping my final assessment on Lost Ark.

Mastering a martial art takes years – if not a lifetime. Disciples must hone their bodies to the point that they perform every attack, every counter, every movement with pinpoint precision. A skilled warrior must move without thinking. Likewise, mastering Sifu&#x27;s combat system takes a high degree of dedication and practice. Like a true martial artist, you must push through the practice pains before you reap any rewards.
In 2017, Sloclap released the martial arts-themed action/RPG Absolver, which let players design …</span>

                    <span>WWE 2K22 launches on March 11 and Visual Concepts/2K have slowly begun rolling out roster reveals. Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that&#x27;s become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who&#x27;s left to plug up the holes. 
Using 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We&#x27;re also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear that have not been formally announced (Tyler Bate would be lonely without his Mustache Mountain partner, Trent Seven, after all). We’ll update this list as new wrestlers are announced, but here’s how the roster is shaping up so far:
AJ Styles
Damien Priest
Kane
Sami Zayn
Note: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there&#x27;s a good chance they’re no longer in the game.
WWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Sifu, the Pak Mei Kung Fu brawler developed by Sloclap, is now out on all platforms. 
A console exclusive for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, Sifu has also been released on the Epic Games Store on PC, and if you preordered or purchased the standard edition, which costs $39.99, you can now play the game. Of course, if you preordered the deluxe edition, which carried with it a $49.99 price tag, you’ve been able to play Sifu since Sunday as that edition granted players early access. 
To celebrate news of Sifu’s launch today, Sloclap has released a launch trailer that showcases what to expect: striking visuals, dope music, and of course, plenty of enemies to punch and kick down to the ground.

“Unfolding a story born from loss, the newly released launch trailer finally reveals the violent spark that has laid the path for a fiery journey, fueled by anger and devastation,” a press release for Sifu reads. “Introducing the five main enemies you will seek out in your quest for redemption, today’s trailer showcases a jolting array of authentic Pak Mei Kung Fu action as the main character, which players can play as male or female, slides through a variety of enemies with skillful, mindful combat.” 

After watching today’s new trailer, be sure to read our thoughts on the game in Game Informer’s Sifu review. Check out this gameplay from Game Informer’s New Gameplay Today segment all about Sifu after that.

                    <span>Pokémon Go is celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day in a couple of different ways. From February 10 through 14, you&#x27;ll have the chance to engage in new events and catch Flabébé for the first time.
This fairy-type Pokémon rides atop a flower and can evolve twice. If you feed it 25 candies, it will transform into Floette. Offer up another 100 candies and it&#x27;ll become Florges, but only after you earn 20 hearts with it as a buddy. Flabébé is from Generation VI and is number 669 on the Pokédex.
During the event, you&#x27;ll also be able to evolve Furfrou in a new way. If you feed it 25 candies and 10,000 stardust, you can select the Heart Trip to give it a festive Valentine&#x27;s Day design.
Along with the Pokémon of note, you&#x27;ll also find the usual suspects out in the wild. This list includes Luvdisc, Chansey, Plusle, Minun, Miltank, Audino, Alomomola, Woobat, Volbeat, and Illumise. All of them have shiny variants, too. Registeel will be the only Pokémon in five-star raids, with Mega Houndoom being the lone Mega Raid.
Spinda is returning to field research tasks, this time rocking a heart pattern. Spinda can also be shiny.
Good luck on the hunt, trainers!</span>

                    <span>Dying Light 2 hit consoles and PC just last week, launching to record numbers for Techland’s zombie parkour franchise. Now, a week later, Eurogamer’s Poland-based site, Eurogamer.pl, has discovered a weapon in Dying Light 2 that appears to be a reference to CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077. A lead designer on Dying Light 2 seems to have confirmed it, too. 
Tak, to oficjalne 🇵🇱❤️ https://t.co/dKPzHvPpop
February 8, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the weapon in Dying Light 2 looks a lot like Cyberpunk 2077’s Mantis Blade weapon, which is less a weapon you hold but one you install directly into your arm. It’s quite metal, literally. 
Now, you might be wondering why Dying Light 2 would reference the critically-maligned Cyberpunk 2077 – sure, both are open-world RPGs based sometime in the future. However, the real connection here is that both Techland and CD Projekt Red are based in Poland. It’s not hard to imagine that Techland wanted to shout out a fellow Poland-based developer in the form of a reference like this. 
Plus, it’s just plain cool. Who doesn’t want blades for arms? As for finding this weapon in Dying Light 2, Eurogamer.pl writes that it can be found on the roof of a building somewhere in the city of Villedor. It’s a scheme you pick up, which you can then use to craft into a weapon. 
For more about Dying Light 2, read Game Informer’s Dying Light 2 review and then check out Techland’s post-launch roadmap that includes five years of DLC. Read Game Informer’s Cyberpunk 2077 review after that.

                    <span>Scalebound was once one of the hottest Microsoft exclusives during the Xbox One’s early years. Developed by Platinum Games, the stylish action title combined Devil May Cry-style action and attitude with dragons. Despite the hype, the game was canceled in 2017 and has become one of gaming&#x27;s curious “What if?” stories. Platinum&#x27;s leadership is still interested in the idea, however, and wants to sit down with Microsoft to make it happen. 
In an interview with IGN Japan, Platinum’s president and vice president, Atsushi Inaba and Hideki Kamiya, respectively, reflected on Scalebound’s cancellation. Inaba states that Kamiya, the game’s creator, talks about reviving Scalebound “all the time.” This isn’t just wishful thinking; the pair wants to have serious talks with Microsoft about revisiting the…</span>

                    <span>Tom Holland is best known for taking on the role of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with Captain America: Civil War way back in 2016. Since then, he’s gone on to star as Spider-Man in multiple films, but for now, he’s put aside the web slingers and increased the amount of “craps” in his vocabulary to play Nathan Drake in Sony’s upcoming Uncharted movie. 
In an interview for the Uncharted movie, Holland was asked by GameSpot what his dream video game adaptation is, and his response was … interesting, to say the least. 
Hey, @A24 and @Naughty_Dog. Tom Holland has a great video game adaptation pitch for you guys. pic.twitter.com/QKKbJYWedf
February 4, 2022
This sounds great, as long as Toni Collette and Alex Wolff are on the cast list.
There’s no telling if Holland is serious, but if he is, we’d love to see what this movie would look like. A live-action Jak and Daxter movie is already pretty wild. Making it a “weird” and “dark” A24 movie? It sounds like this would adapt the sequel or the threequel rather than the Precursor Legacy. Maybe add in a touch of horror, and we’re sold. 
While waiting for this hypothetical Jak and Daxter movie, check out this official trailer for Holland’s Uncharted movie and then watch this trailer that reveals Sully’s signature mustache.

                    <span>In many ways, Semantle is hard mode Wordle. Gone is the simplified dictionary and five-letter limit, meaning words can be any type and length, and gone is any indication of correctly guessed letters or positions.

Instead, you&#x27;ve got two new helpers: the ability to make infinite guesses, and a neural network able to learn word associations telling you how close, conceptually, you are to the correct answer. I&#x27;ve yet to find the solution in fewer than 50 guesses.

                    <span>Speaking as a generally terrified person who curls up into a tiny ball whenever they feel threatened, the tower defence genre really resonates with me. Like a besieged castle, I am also in a state of constant high-alert and paralysing, teeth-grinding stress. I am incapable of any kind of meaningful conflict resolution, and embarrassingly vulnerable to being destroyed by hundreds of angry men with swords over the course of several helpless minutes. 


Diplomacy Is Not An Option doesn’t bill itself as a tower defence game, but it is a real-time strategy game about protecting your medieval settlement as wave after wave of attackers try to smash it up. Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top.

Battle royale money machine Fortnite will not be updated to work on the Steam Deck – and according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, that’s down to a lack of “confidence that we’d be able to combat cheating” on Linux platforms.

Over the weekend, the former Irrational developer who placed the meme-ified Baguette Boy in Binfinite&#x27;s Burial At Sea expansion explained why he&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s an interesting story about how weird game development it is, how weird games themselves are as technical objects, and about creativity within technical constraints.

                    <span>There is one upside to Lost Ark having the aged tang of MMOs gone by, even if it’s specific to the visuals rather than the familiar mechanical trappings. Committing to the player numbers game of a free-to-play model for its South Korean launch back in 2019, Lost Ark always needed to perform on low-end and luxury PCs alike, and its imminent Western release is following the same rules. The result: a game that rarely looks outstanding but always runs smoothly, whether it’s on older budget hardware or the best graphics cards and CPUs of today.

                    <span>In last year&#x27;s hands-on with free-to-play action RPG-inspired MMO Lost Ark last year, I thought it had potential if you could survive the early slow burn.

                    <span>I was sold from the moment our Justicar sliced off the mutated Apostate Preacher’s tentacle arm. The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. 
I’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn&#x27;t obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight. That should sound enticing to just about anyone.

The pitch suitably set for bathos, no series fan will be surprised by what happens next. No sooner has our protagonist left the tunnel than he’s launched skyward by a backhand from an ogre. In the match’s opening moments, he sees more airtime than the ball. And shortly afterwards, he’s a footnote, prone in the grass as much larger - and better armed - humanoids pound the earth around his limp form.

The sentence is lower than the 27 to 33-month term the U.S. Attorney had asked for.

The man, who is seen as one of the driving forces behind the now-defunct site, helped to set up and manage servers and also helped with coding. Several other defendants connected to the site will have their day in court later this year.

                    <span>Death&#x27;s Door is a great little game. I&#x27;ve been meaning to play it properly for a while, ever since I was told that you can slice signposts in half and then when you try and read it there&#x27;s only half of the text left. And so what better game, I thought, to test out the new cloud gaming beta on the Xbox this weekend? (In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)
Reader, I bloody love Death&#x27;s Door. Like Katharine said, it&#x27;s kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world. Also, there are fun jokes like a gravedigger being called Steadhone and stuff. But I also hate Death&#x27;s Door, because it&#x27;s still not an easy game, and I think I ended up playing it improperly this weekend.

After filing our OlliOlli World review, I investigated and, yup, you stumble across him in one particularly fiendish level, where he is being used as promotional bait by a scheming business frog. Good thing no real company would stoop so low as to use Daniel T&#x27;s likeness in such a cynical, ultimately successful way. 
Ahem. Well, if Danny Trejo can show up in this kickflip &#x27;em up, what other cameos may appear? We used the game&#x27;s character customisation menu to cook up some possibilities.

But they have now confirmed something that might not be big but is large: they plan for the expansion to feel as big as the whole base game all over again. Factorio is not a small game, so that&#x27;s an impressive plan.

                    <span>So, there&#x27;s this South Korean MMORPG called Mir4 that&#x27;s been out on mobile and PC for about six months now. It&#x27;s free-to-play, so it started off with decent numbers, but from October to November the monthly average player count jumped up by 32k. It&#x27;s tailing off now, but still averaging 60,000 Steam users over the last three months, a surge you&#x27;d think would be worth celebrating, right? I investigated and discovered that Mir4 is one bizarre game, with one soul-crushing USP: NFTs.
That&#x27;s right folks. The game lets you mint your character as an NFT, and even mine cryptocurrency if you so choose. If this is the future, then it seems cold and strange and sad. Also, Mir4 is a terrible game.

It&#x27;s designed to curb creepy behaviour within the company&#x27;s much-hyped metaverse by preventing other player&#x27;s from invading your personal space.

                    <span>Wordle is a genre now. Its rapid success has caused a proliferation of browser games in which all players are presented with the same puzzle each day, limited guesses, and easy options to share their results.

My new favourite is Worldle. It meets all the criteria, including being free and playable in your browser, but instead of guessing a word you&#x27;re attempt to identify a country by its silhouette.

                    <span>My eyes unfocused partway through the trailer for Genshin Impact&#x27;s 2.5 update. There was some sort of mystical calamity and it was all very dramatic. Then, almost after the real trailer was finished, there was a minute or more of the actual game, as a character gathered herbs in a pretty field at night, mixed a drink, and unlocked some items. 

I was immediately focused back in. Update 2.5, &quot;When the Sakura Bloom&quot;, will launch on February 16th with three new characters.

                    <span>Developers offer free weekends with their games all the time, but it feels more like a trap when the game is The Sims 4. Become immersed in EA&#x27;s dollhouse creation kit and what awaits you is a world of costly DLC.

But then heck, I like the game and I&#x27;ve only bought a handful of content packs because I liked the look of the kitchen cupboards. So play The Sims 4 for free on Steam this weekend, and buy it at 88% off if you like it.

                    <span>The U.S. Government is seeking a five-year prison sentence for Gary Bowser, a member of the infamous Nintendo modding group Team-Xecuter. The prosecution argues that a tough sentence is needed to send a clear message to other criminals. Bowser&#x27;s attorneys disagree and note that their client was used by other group members who, unlike him, probably made millions.

                    <span>Powerful football leagues are calling on EU legislators to fix a provision in the Digital Services Act that would allow pirated content to stay online following a takedown notice, until complaints can be verified. Any delay in the removal of pirated live streams would damage the interests of the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A plus dozens of other leagues, they argue.

                    <span>Nine years and over $434,000,000 (£320m) after starting crowdfunding, space sim Star Citizen and its singleplayer spin-off Squadron 42 are still very far from completion. They&#x27;re sustained by fans&#x27; hopes and dreams of what the games might one day become but this is a double-edged sword. The developers, Cloud Imperium Games have now decided to make their public development roadmap for future updates more vague, because some players get dead narked about delays. I can see that happening after nine years.

                    <span>Last year, Ed wrote about how he wished Ian Hitman could skip in IO Interactive&#x27;s big shiny assassin sim. Well, Agent 47 clearly needs to make the next stop on his international mission list a nice, relaxing retreat on the Mediterranean island of Pinar del Mar. Not to murder anyone, of course. But to hang out with Alba for some all important frolicking lessons. She&#x27;s a pro at this skipping marlarkey. If she&#x27;s not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she&#x27;s running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she&#x27;s doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.

                    <span>Eight years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V, Rockstar Games have finally confirmed yes, they really are making a new GTA. For eight years they&#x27;ve focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they&#x27;ll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.

                    <span>It&#x27;s not that easy, you know, hating everything. Deckbuilders are bad, I repeat, while enjoying one against my will. D&amp;D can go to hell, I screech, in between weekly sessions. Corporate saturation crushes better games, I insist, alt-tabbing out of Vermintide.
This week it&#x27;s the FTL-inspired The Last Bastion that&#x27;s making things difficult. You&#x27;re the leader of a defeated army regiment, retreating across a series of regions to a stronghold where your king plans to make a last stand. It&#x27;s sort of roguelike, with a hint of something like Reigns in balancing your forces and reputation, with light interactive fiction parts. I&#x27;m a little bit annoyed that I like it.

                    <span>Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!
It reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it&#x27;s also unashamedly strange.

                    <span>If you’re opted into Valve’s Steam client beta, you may have noticed a couple of small but potentially very helpful UI updates that rolled out in the past few hours. Changes that are available on desktop but could be even more helpful, methinks, on the upcoming Steam Deck.


The first appears on the Library page of games you own, but haven’t installed yet: a new “Space required” string that lists how much hard drive or SSD space it will need. As it stands on the main Steam client, you can’t normally see this info without clicking the Install button, so that’s a click saved whenever you’re trying to find out if a new game (or nostalgic re-install) will fit onto stuffed storage.

Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is the new one&#x27;s name and surprise, launching later this month is its game—less than five months after the first.

                    <span>Dying Light 2 is out and hoo boy, is it a tough nut to crack. Not in the hours to completion sense, or even difficulty in general – Matthew’s review found a rather unthreatening strain of undead – but in how tricky it is to get running smoothly on PC. That goes double if you want to dolly up this post-apocalypse with some shiny ray tracing features, so even if you’ve got a rig that can breeze through most games, I’d recommend reading on for a guide to Dying Light 2’s best settings.

                    <span>There is a very high chance that Mike Booth&#x27;s fingerprints are on one of your favourite games. He&#x27;s one of the original founders of Turtle Rock Studios and creator of Left 4 Dead. At Valve, he worked on CS:GO and Team Fortress 2. Westwood Studio&#x27;s classic RPG Nox? That&#x27;s Booth as well. After a stint working on VR games for Facebook, he&#x27;s currently the chief creative officer at Bad Robot Games, the game-centric offshoot of J.J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot film and TV production company. But, not content with having one job at a time, Booth has also been working at Resolution Games on the VR tabletop RPG Demeo.
A streamlined, high production values version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Demeo won a lot of &quot;best of&quot; accolades in VR game round-ups. But soon it&#x27;s coming to regular ol&#x27; PCs, with early access starting on April 7th. I spoke to Booth about Demeo, but also the future of co-op games. He had quite a lot to say.

                    <span>When you become a game designer, you are handed a big book of antagonists to use as guilt-free bullet fodder. First among them is the reliable, stinky zombie. (Also found in this repertoire are Nazis and Slimes. They are beyond the scope of this listicle.) The zombie is a preternaturally killable being. It has already experienced mortality once, so this creature more than anyone is ready to suffer the ignominy of death. It has practice, it knows what&#x27;s coming. Being a zombie is like having two degrees. You&#x27;re extra qualified, and you probably groan a lot.
Here&#x27;s a list of the best zombies in PC games.

                    <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN collects IP addresses of persistent pirates and asks the associated ISPs to forward warnings to these subscribers. The Netherlands&#x27; largest ISP, Ziggo, refused to do so due to privacy concerns. This week, a local court agreed that ISPs indeed need a separate data processing license to forward BREIN&#x27;s warning letters.

                    <span>I become more interested in supernatural, open world, first-person magic &#x27;em up Ghostwire: Tokyo with every new thing I see of it. Today, Tango Gameworks broadcast a 20 minute-long showcase and developer interview that had enough stealth, grapple hooks, and paranormal finger-guns to convince me completely. You can watch the full thing below.

                    <span>The railgun is the best weapon in the Quake series, and so I am excited that it&#x27;s coming to Risk Of Rain 2. The class-based looter-shooter is getting its first paid DLC, Survivors Of The Void, which adds two new classes - including the Railgunner. You can watch a trailer for the expansion below in preparation of its release on March 1st.

                    <span>I have played Vampire Survivors twice - that’s two (2) times - in total. In only that short space of time, the arcade-style game has sunk its teeth into me. You swat away hordes of monsters with weapons and magic that fire automatically. All it needs from you is one hand on the wheel. You are, in essence, the pale captain of a battleship that must weave its way through demons and bats. The garlic and holy water cannons will take care of the rest.
Not only do I crave more vampiric survival, but I also wish it had been released years ago. This is the perfect pre-lesson huddle. The perfect after-school treat. A nerdy talk generator for those locker chats.

I am therefore extremely grateful for Narrative Device, a browser-based AI doodad which generates the opening paragraph of a story based on two themes or things you feed into it. Finally, some help for the writers of the world! It&#x27;s potentially interesting and useful, or at the very least it is fun to make a computer say silly things.

                    <span>This week the Electronic Wireless Show podcast is going all in on our favourite finishing moves. This doesn&#x27;t just mean things from fighting games, although they do obviously make a good showing. As you can imagine, Nate makes the case for RTS games with what he and his pals term &#x27;the GG push&#x27;. Plus, we have a great Mortal Kombat themed Cavern Of Lies this week, courtesy of Matthew.
Much time is spent on some excellent digressions this week, including James McAvoy as a rampaging dinosaur from Jurassic Park (a state of affairs that I think would have improved his weird improv film My Son). Plus, could Matthew Save the world if he grew to six size the times of the earth and cut off a slab of his bum like a big steak, to feed us all? Will someone make a game like Deep Rock Galactic, but for mining Matthew&#x27;s celestial bum-meat? A whimsical episode this week indeed.

                    <span>So good it will give you blisters. It&#x27;s a sentence you might read in a glossy 1990s PlayStation magazine ad. &quot;So good it will give you blisters,&quot; it says of the latest polygonal bloodsport, with a wired controller hanging from a ceiling, covered in gore. The hyperbole of a generation, a distortion of edgy marketing either aped or mocked by today&#x27;s advertising sophisticates. You get blisters from walking up hills, not video games. In the forensically sucky cyberpresent of 2022, there is no place for such exaggeration.
OlliOlli World is so good it will give you blisters. I know because I got one.

Still, the makers are quite insistent, so let&#x27;s humour their charade and hear what they have to say about their future plans for the base-building Norse mythology survival game. Steam Deck support, caves in the Mountains biome, a pretty moth in the Mistlands... okay, sure.

                    <span>In 2009, the major record labels decided to remove DRM from music in the iTunes store. More than a decade has passed since but the issue could now make a comeback in a piracy liability lawsuit. Internet provider RCN plans to use it as a defense, while the labels claim that the DRM issue is old and irrelevant.

                    <span>As the consolidation of the games industry continues, Sony buying Bungie is the acquisition that might most directly affect me, someone who has played over 2000 hours of Destiny 2. Bungie have said things will continue as normal on all platforms. But beyond the usual issues with consolidation and platformholders buying studios, the concerns I have for Destiny 2&#x27;s future stem from the same old source: Bungie&#x27;s own decisions. The grind needs to end.

                    <span>Western Digital are continuing their charge into high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSDs with the WD Black SN770. This is pretty straight down the middle as far as Gen 4 SSDs go: the 1TB model I’ve tested claims sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s for reads and 4900MB/s for writes, enough to embarrass any PCIe 3.0 SSD without veering into mega-enthusiast territory. There’s a broad range of capacities too, starting at 250GB and ending at a roomy 2TB.

                    <span>February has finally arrived and that means it&#x27;s FromSoftware month, baby. Elden Ring is almost here, so you best limber up, do your stretches, have a bath. Do what you need to do to prepare yourself for a colossal undertaking. One thing that might help get you in a Soulsborne headspace is Bloodborne PSX, a free PlayStation 1-esque demake of FromSoft&#x27;s gothic action-RPG.

                    <span>One of the most popular Internet monsters, a grotesque neck-snapping concrete figure codenamed SCP-173, is losing its face. SCP-173 is part of the SCP Foundation, a collaborative online horror writing project which most famously inspired Remedy&#x27;s Control, and has appeared in several SCP fan games, too. But as SCP&#x27;s administrators wrestle with copyright and morality issues, they&#x27;re preparing to remove that iconic image, which actually is a photo of a sculpture by a Japanese artist.

                    <span>No, Dying Light 2 doesn’t take 500 hours to complete. Call it closer to 30 and change, although my map still swarms with chores and requests to deal with post-campaign. Plenty of words have been written about Techland’s backfiring boast of a three week runtime, so no need to relitigate that here. Going in, the only time value I was interested in was how long - if ever - the game takes to sink its teeth into you.

                    <span>The creators of retro platformer Shovel Knight have announced a whole new adventure, drawing inspiration from different classics this time. Mina The Hollower is its name, and retro action-adventure with Zelda and Castlevania influences is its game. Like with Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games are partially crowdfunding Mina through a Kickstarter campaign, and in less than a day they&#x27;ve already passed the goal. Have a peek in the trailer.

                    <span>Capcom released an &#x27;HD&#x27; remaster of Resident Evil 4 in 2014, but their official makeover is nothing compared to the work by a small team of modders across almost eight years. Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it&#x27;s the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game&#x27;s textures and models with high-def versions, they&#x27;ve tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures. Dead impressive.

                    <span>Later this month, a 52-year old British man will be sentenced by a New York federal court for his role in the SPARKS piracy Scene group. Mr. Bridi, who was extradited to the US from Cyprus previously pleaded guilty. While the defense argues that a reduced sentence is warranted, the U.S. Government is asking the court to award a significant 27 to 33-month term to deter other pirates.

When will From Software&#x27;s gothic slasher make the move to our superior home computers?

I&#x27;ve no answer for you, but fan-made demake Bloodborne PSX should tide you over for a little while. It&#x27;s Bloodborne as if made for 32-bit consoles, four hours long, and features the original game&#x27;s first two bosses. It&#x27;s out now.

Seriously, I own some geeky merch to demonstrate my love for this series; up to and including, yes, the official Life Is Strange deck of playing cards. In other words, I am exactly the sort of fan the Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection is geared towards; so you may be surprised when I say that I&#x27;m not planning on picking it up anytime soon.
I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve been wary of the remasters of the first Life Is Strange title and its prequel Before The Storm ever since the first stills were released. &quot;Look how much emotion their faces show now!&quot; was the boast, splashed across side-by-side images of Rachel frowning in the original vs Rachel smiling in the remaster, Chloe frowning in the original vs Chloe smiling in the remaster, Max smiling slightly in the original vs Max grinning widely in the remaster... perhaps you begin to see my issue.

It&#x27;s Sony buying Bungie. It&#x27;s Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. It&#x27;s Tencent accidentally dropping £365 billion down a grate as they stroll down the street and unknowingly buy the Earth&#x27;s crust. They were on the phone to me at the time, putting an offer on my flat. I am tired of these big companies buying everything. Can we just slow down for a hot second and chill out a bit, please?

I don’t think any other SSD manufacturer so consistently goes quiet for months on end, then suddenly rocks up at your house, slams a world-beating NVMe drive on your desk and wordlessly disappears again. It happened with the A2000, it happened with the KC2500 and now it’s happened with the Fury Renegade.

                    <span>I keep trying to figure out how to describe The Waylanders’ unique blend of endearment and jank. Unfortunately I am cursed with chronic writer’s brain so all I can come up with is this: it feels like a really good first draft.


For every aspect of worldbuilding that I enjoyed, there was a bug that had to be overlooked. For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing. Over and over, I found these flaws didn’t stop me from enjoying the core that I could see underneath. At least, until the game (as far as I can tell) bugged so badly that I literally couldn’t continue.

                    <span>World Update 7 has landed in Microsoft Flight Simulator, continuing efforts to fancy up the globe with more-detailed terrain and handcrafted models for landmarks. This time Australia gets the polish, with scanned photogrammetry replacements for 11 cities, handcrafted models for 94 landmarks and points of interest, and new local missions. It looks pretty! Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I often find myself intrigued by games where you have to manage a business - not the slow, thoughtful ones like Strange Horticulture (which I like for a different reason), but the surprisingly deep management ones that are like strategy games except for coffee production instead of war.
I am usually catastrophically bad at these games, as I lack the sheer nerve to commit all my assets to something at once, or take out loans to cover a product run, even in a fictional digital setting. Still, I was drawn to Startup Panic like a moth to a flame, and giggled to myself at the prospect of cosplaying as a Silicon Valley nerd trying to reinvent having a chicken coop. I called my founder Beth, and the company was therefore Betherium. But it turned out that the product I was tasked with making and selling was, basically, Facebook.

                    <span>Oh sure, Sony buying Bungie was big buyout business news yesterday, but the real mega-acquisition of the day was Wordle. The New York Times, a hardcopy blog, are buying the viral hit word puzzle game for &quot;an undisclosed price in the low-seven figures.&quot; They say it will be free when it moves under their banner, though it&#x27;s not clear if it will stay that way.

The official site has been offline for more than a week and many bots already stopped uploading content to third-party sites weeks ago. ETTV has recovered from internal troubles in the past but, without a word from the admin, a comeback is not expected anytime soon.

It remains funny and silly and an unexpectedly good fit.

                    <span>Just when you thought all the big movers and shakers had done their multi-billion dollar acquisition deals for the year, Sony have just announced they&#x27;re buying Bungie for $3.6 billion. A small sum, perhaps, in the face of the $69 billion Microsoft are currently shelling out for Activision Blizzard, but rather than simply subsuming the Destiny developer into the PlayStation mothership, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan has said that Bungie will &quot;remain an independent and multi-platform studio and publisher.&quot; Well!

                    <span>Following Code Force&#x27;s recent demonstration, I was optimistic about the upcoming space 4X/simulation/strategy/forward slash game Distant Worlds 2. The original was a game I very nearly adored, but playing it always meant being a little too frustrated to talk about it without complaining a lot (which, granted, I do about everything, but still).
Code Force have since sent us a preview build, and I&#x27;ve been consumed with it for the better part of a week. I&#x27;m struggling to gauge exactly how much to reserve, because it&#x27;s had me positively cackling at my minor successes and howling in enjoyable despair at my setbacks. If they can do, ooh, two thirds of what I&#x27;m hoping in the six weeks before its release on March 10th, this could be every bit as brilliant as its predecessor, with fewer flaws.

It&#x27;s codenamed Project Golden Nekker and... that&#x27;s about all we know for know. It&#x27;s not another &#x27;Witcher Tales&#x27; like the previous singleplayer Gwent game, like Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales, and it is confirmed to have at least two (2) monsters. Possibly three (3) if you consider that man is the real monster. Or four (4) if you hate libraries.

                    <span>Even with a bunch of post-launch performance improvements, Microsoft Flight Simulator is still the kind of game that can make most PCs sweat. Good news, then, for frequent flyers who happen to own an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card: Flight Sim is getting DLSS support this year.


Specifically, DLSS will be available when running the sim in DirectX 12, as part of a handful of upcoming DX12 enhancements that also include optimisations for playing on multiple monitors. Developers Asobo Studio confirmed the DLSS addition in a recent devstream, which you can watch in full below, though the feature is still being tested so there’s no specific date beyond 2022.

In celebration, both the director of the original JRPG and the creative director of the recent FF7 Remake have posted messages looking back and forward. Along with several FF7 mobile games kicking about, they tease that more new FF7 things we don&#x27;t know about are coming. Hopefully this means we&#x27;ll hear more about efforts to complete the remake, but I guess they could also be talking about merch or new movies.

The electronic twinkle of health-restoring chicken, which sounds uncannily like the shield’s up sound from 1999 classic 3D Astro Blaster. The ‘boo boo de boo, boo boo de boop’ of the chest-opening jingle, to which my shoulders cannot help but shimmy. Best of all: the plink of picking up an XP-granting gem - at first a sporadic treat, soon a near constant hum as the tide of enemies grows from a trickle into a flood. 
Vampire Survivors is a simple, early access, arcade-style game about dodging an ever-growing horde of monsters while acquiring spells that fire automatically. You can (and should) play it with one hand while eating a bag of crisps. It’s a very good way to spend £2.

                    <span>Intel’s Arc graphics cards are, despite apparent delays, likely to launch this year. And not just with the expectation of being good GPUs, but with the hope that they can fix one of the biggest vexations in PC gaming: a years-long component shortage that’s made all of the best graphics cards nearly impossible to buy at fair prices.


Intel graphics chief Raja Koduri is at least well aware of the pressure, tweeting that the company is “working hard to find a path towards the mission - getting millions of Arc GPUs into the hands of PC gamers every year.” Koduri was responding to an open letter from our friends at PC Gamer, calling on Intel to finally toss an escape rope down the hardware hellmouth we’ve all found ourselves trapped in. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also responded, claiming “We’re on it.”

Humanity, an in-browser shader created by David A. Roberts, is worth the four minutes it takes to watch.

                    <span>Halo Infinite has been having trouble with its Big Team Battle mode since launch. Attempts to fix it before Christmas and earlier in January largely failed, with the mode available but matchmaking issues making it near-impossible to play for some. 

Now 343 Industries think they&#x27;ve fixed the issue, with a patch due to be deployed sometime after February 3rd.

                    <span>This past week Blizzard announced a survival game set in an all-new universe. There were almost no other details about it and it was described as being at an &quot;early stage&quot;, but it seems the studio have been working on it for close to five years already.

                    <span>This weekend I am looping the Assault On Precinct 13 theme to build the plodding determination I will need to survive the impending NFT bonanza. I do take some comfort in the fact that NFTs are so unpopular that Riot had scramble to cover after accidentally suggesting a Valorant character liked NFTs. And I especially enjoyed Yanis Varoufakis explaining why the metacryptofungiverse sucks. But more and more companies are talking about NFTs and things will get worse, and I&#x27;ll need the energy I can only get from Precinct 13 (and the amazing unused Jimmy Chambers song based on it).
But the terrible future can wait, what are you playing this weekend?

The games I&#x27;ve collected this week for the first TFI Friday of the year are going to ease us gently out of the time loop that we&#x27;ve been stuck in the last umpteen months. Accordingly, the first one is a time loop puzzle game.

                    <span>Through an entirely unplanned sequence of events, I&#x27;m currently playing two big action adventure games that couldn&#x27;t be less alike. One is God Of War, a big, serious dadventure epic about an emotionally distant father trying his darnedest to connect with his (at times very irritating) son. The other is Kena: Bridge Of Spirits, an altogether more wholesome adventure about a young girl cleansing a lush, forested mountainside from a serious case of bad vibes and helping lost ghosts pass on to the other side. 
About the only thing they have in common is that they both have what one might call &#x27;cute&#x27; NPC companions. Dad Of War is joined by his eager archer &quot;BOY!&quot; Atreus, while Kena has her gaggle of black, fluffy Rot friends (above, right). According to the widely accepted law of big googly-eyes, I should find the Rot absolutely adorable and thus beyond reproach. Atreus does not have big googly-eyes (they are merely wide and naive), but he is certainly a lot cuter than God Of War&#x27;s other main companion, a talking disembodied head. And yet. Even though Atreus has now reached that stage where he&#x27;s doing all his adolescent whining and rebellion and &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot; nonsense in the space of about two hours, I would much rather have this sulky pre-teen by my side than the interminable Rot. Let me explain.

                    <span>In theory, I miss auto scrolling arcade shooters and would love it if they came back. In reality, they come back all the time and I never really click with them because what I really miss is being a child and feeling like almost every game I saw was magical.
I&#x27;m pretty bad at them as well, which doesn&#x27;t help. Mostly though, I became jaded and curmudgeonly at around nine years old, and will never know such naive wonder again.
Still, Hyper Echelon is fun.
