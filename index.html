                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn&#x27;t died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite&#x27;s official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon

May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there&#x27;s not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite&#x27;s current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it&#x27;s anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it&#x27;s unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.

                              <span>Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25’s cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game’s first full trailer provides the look at it in action. 
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit. 


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery. 

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.</span>

                              <span>Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I&#x27;m not just saying that because it&#x27;s the subject of our current cover story. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it&#x27;s still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We&#x27;re very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year&#x27;s Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. 
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. 


However, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. 
&quot;Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,&quot; the story reads. 
Of course, things could change so we&#x27;ll see what happens. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

                              <span>2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K&#x27;s biggest franchises are prime for a new game. 
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That&#x27;s less than a month away so we don&#x27;t have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.

While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. 
The last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you&#x27;re looking for something to play through in that universe. 
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. 
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It&#x27;s been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here&#x27;s what we want in a BioShock 4. 
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer&#x27;s summer gaming showcase schedule.

                              <span>After 10,000 signatures and an unsatisfactory response, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing to go one step further in holding publishers accountable for shutting down their live service games, making them forever unplayable. 


The Stop Killing Games campaign set up a petition on the UK government&#x27;s website last month following the shutdown of servers for and subsequent delisting from every digital marketplace of The Crew. Any petition that gets 10,000 signatures requires a government response, which in this case was, &quot;Those selling games must comply with UK consumer law. They must provide clear information and allow continued access to games if sold on the understanding that they will remain playable indefinitely.&quot;

                              <span>Gray Zone Warfare has been riddled with mixed reviews on Steam, mainly concerning the many bugs that make it sometimes impossible to play. So, in an effort to address these issues, Madfinger Games has announced a fix for several notable glitches, with a mission to include &quot;over 200&quot; improvements. 


I&#x27;ve seen a lot of patch notes throughout my time in gaming, and the scope of 200 sure does seem like a lot. While the specifics of what they will include are relatively a mystery, we know the grenade exploit will be patched. This annoying glitch allows players to hurt members of their own faction, taking their gear in the process. Now, these faction traitors will no longer have this power once GZW Patch 1 rolls out. 




Other than the exploit, the crashes that cause a player&#x27;s gear to disappear will be addressed. I, for one, would like to regain all those quest rewards I lost from this. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like these objects will be placed back, as it will only get rid of the crashes. 


What the other 200 improvements will entail is unknown, but players have been chiming in on a few of them. Specifically, soldiers hope to see a buff to shotguns, which have been considered a relatively weak weapon amongst some players. 


Another upcoming feature that may make it to GZW Patch 1 is the day/night cycle. Nevertheless, it is only slated for &quot;one of the early updates,&quot; so it might not be available for the first patch. 


You can expect Gray Zone Warfare Patch 1 sometime next week, either debuting at the beginning of the week or, at the latest, May 24, 2024.

Diablo 4 Season 4 Armor Cap


The actual hard number Armor Cap in Diablo 4 Season 4 is 9,230. This means that for all characters in Season 4, you should aim to reach 9,230 Armor, but any point does not grant as much survivability and damage mitigation as it does up until reaching the Armor Cap. This season removed Damage Reduction as a rollable stat from the roll pools, making Armor the most important stat to hit the cap for when gearing your character.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV has a new promotional event where buying items in real life benefits players in-game. If you want to collect some of the sweet new Mountain Dew crossover items in FFXIV, including a brand new exclusive mount, you’ll want to pick up a few bottles of the sugary drink. Here’s what to do to earn all of the items while this event is still running. 


All Mountain Dew drinks and points, explained


For starters, the FFXIV crossover event with Mountain Dew is only running for a limited time, so don’t wait or you might miss out on these goodies. How the event works is players buy specially marked Mountain Dew Gaming 20oz bottles, and only them. 2-liters, cans, and so on don’t count at this time.

Take the Fused Reservoir mod on Wisp for example, which seriously improves the quality of life when playing her. One such mod is an interesting case due to its usefulness on said weapon. Here&#x27;s how to get the Scattered Justice mod in Warframe.

                              <span>Rumors about a Fallout x Fortnite collaboration have been circulating the community, particularly in light of the Amazon Prime Video show. Those speculations are now realized with an artwork teaser for an upcoming Fortnite update. 


In this teaser, we see the series&#x27; iconic Power Armor, which almost anyone, fan or not, would recognize. But instead of Fallout&#x27;s classic look, the suit of armor will be transcended into Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Royale.




Now, the burning question is: What unique elements will this Fortnite x Fallout collaboration bring? It&#x27;s a safe bet that we&#x27;ll see new Fallout skins, a trend we&#x27;ve witnessed with numerous other franchises like Avatar: The Last Airbender. The Power Suit, featured prominently in the teaser, is likely to be one of them. Personally, I&#x27;m hoping for a Fallout Vault Jumpsuit to be part of the mix.


New Fallout-themed quests could be another feature included in the crossover. Fortnite isn&#x27;t shy of having collaboration missions, similar to Star Wars lightsaber tasks. Map iterations may also be a part of this, possibly including vault locations. Fortnite already has vaults in-game, so why not add a Fallout touch to match the theme? 


As for items, a Pip-Boy could be used for Battle Royale. It would make for a great accessory, keeping with the tradition of tracking information for the player. 


Given that the Fallout franchise has multiple entries, Fortnite could go almost anywhere with this collaboration. It could offer content for one of the most famous entries, Fallout 4, or focus on some of the newer elements of the TV show. Of course, there are plenty of other iterations, such as Fallout 76 and New Vegas. 


Only time will tell what this Fortnite x Fallout collaboration will bring. But the one thing we know for sure is that war never changes.

                              <span>Good news for anyone playing Redfall, or anyone who cares about a gaming ecosystem where publishers can’t make entire titles vanish from existence: the game is still going to get its offline mode. 


Arkane Austin has just announced that Redfall will be getting one final update before the studio shuts its doors for good. The update will make some changes to the Neighborhood and Nest systems, potentially pulling in new or returning players, and it will also add single player pausing and an offline mode to let people actually continue to play the game, which otherwise would have all but disappeared whenever Microsoft decided to take down the servers. 




Earlier this month Microsoft essentially dissolved four studios in one unceremonious swoop. Redfall developer Arkane Austin got cut alongside Tango Gameworks (Hi-Fi Rush) and Alpha Dog Games (Mighty DOOM), while Roundhouse Studios got merged into ZeniMax Online Studios. It was another heartbreaking example of game developers losing work, whether or not their game succeeded in the market. Redfall didn’t wow reviewers or gamers last year, but Hi-Fi Rush was a definite success.


The final Redfall update is bittersweet news to say the least. The game might have failed to make an impact, but Arkane proved with Prey that it has the capacity to make a great game. Given a little more time to make updates and actually release the game’s planned DLC, Arkane Austin might have been able to turn Redfall around. Now we’ll never know. The last update will technically keep the game alive, but with Arkane Austin itself being shuttered, that doesn’t feel like much of a win.

                              <span>Once you start caring about min-maxing your build in Warframe, Arcane choice comes into play massively. These little upgrades pack a huge punch in practice, providing what is essentially another mod worth of stats when meeting the right condition. Having the right Arcane for the job is quite important, as with this Arcane. Here&#x27;s how to get the Primary Frostbite Arcane in Warframe.


Where to farm the Primary Frostbite Arcane in Warframe


Image via Destructoid


The Primary Frostbite Arcane is acquired through the Conjunction Survival mission Circulus, located on Lua. If you don&#x27;t have access to this node yet, you&#x27;ll want to progress the story until it becomes available. Once you get access to the mission, progress until you reach 20 minutes survived. This will give you a Rotation C reward, among that pool being the Primary Frostbite Arcane.


If you&#x27;re getting unlucky or have a lot of Lua Thrax Plasm around, you can head to the Chrysalith and speak to Archimedean Yonta to purchase Primary Frostbite for 15 Lua Thrax Plasm each. To max out the Arcane, you need 21 of the unranked version.


Is the Primary Frostbite Arcane worth using?


At max rank, Primary Frostbite will grant 3% Critical Damage and 2.25% Multishot for 12 seconds when applying a Cold status effect. This stacks up to 40 times, for a potential 120% Critical Damage and 90% Multishot. While this sounds great, this is only useful on specific builds where the Cold status effect is applied consistently, and only for primary weapons. If you have a weapon like that, this is great, but otherwise, you can safely ignore it.

                              <span>We all knew it was coming, but EA has shared details on this year&#x27;s Madden NFL game, simply titled EA Sports Madden NFL 25 (not to be confused with the Madden NFL 25 from 2013). With three different editions available across multiple platforms, we&#x27;ve broken down what each one contains and how much they cost ahead of the game&#x27;s release on August 16.





EA Sports Madden NFL 25 platforms


EA Sports Madden NFL 25 is available to pre-order on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions also come with a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version respectively, so last-generation console owners can pick up those versions for access.

But for those excluded from events, it’s not much fun. 


The bummer here is that the Mountain Dew Gaming partnership isn&#x27;t for all players on the North American Data Centers  —  the terms and conditions state it&#x27;s for residents of the United States only — so that excludes a lot of players typically in that region.  And for physical prizes, there&#x27;s no shipping outside of the continental US. 


Of course, more region locked codes have frustrated players excluded again, particularly those in North American Data Centers but not US residents. The responses to Final Fa…</span>

                              <span>EA released a reveal trailer for College Football 25 and pulled out all the stops to deliver a presentation package true to the sport&#x27;s unrivaled pageantry. 


College football is entrenched in tradition. From hitting the &quot;play like a champion today sign&quot; in South Bend, to running down the hill as a team in Clemson, every college has their own unique rituals that set them apart from other schools. EA Sports College Football 25 tapped into that history in its first official reveal trailer. Alongside a carefully curated look at the game in motion, these incredible visuals, audio, and player physics give fans a sample of what to expect.

EA Sports College Football 25 features 134 Division I schools, and the reveal trailer left no stone unturned, showing dozens of different stadiums with accurate mascots, crowds, and pre-game traditions. Accompanied by a marching band remix of Guns N&#x27; Roses Welcome To The Jungle, it&#x27;s hard not to get excited watching crunching tackles and toe-tap catches on the sideline while watching the reveal.  


EA also released a blog alongside the trailer going over new features, modes, presentation changes, and more. EA Sports College Football 25 officially launches on July 19, so fans don&#x27;t have too long of a wait before finally getting their hands on this highly anticipated sports title.

Well, if not, it might be time to do so, as not only is the community seemingly fully on board with Bungie&#x27;s next flagship, but there&#x27;s a lot of exciting stuff being shown off, like the improved weapon enhancement system.


Indeed, Bungie&#x27;s latest This Week in Destiny blog post has gone in-depth on Destiny 2&#x27;s new and improved weapon enhancement feature, and everything suggests it&#x27;s going to be a hoot. The gist of it is that all the currently active weapons (i.e. the stuff that&#x27;s been issued out after Beyond Light) will have access to an up-to-date version of the masterworking and levelling systems, available via the three-stage enhancement upgrades that unlock as a given weapon is levelled-up.

                              <span>The iconic Kar98k sniper rifle is returning to Call of Duty in Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, but when will you be able to get your hands on this behemoth? I&#x27;ve got the official date so you can get ready. 


New weapons are added to Call of Duty every season, giving players new options to add to their loadouts. Usually, these new guns are pretty powerful, which makes unlocking and leveling them up necessary if you want to be a part of the meta. 


While Season 3 Reloaded added Advanced Warfare&#x27;s BAL-27, we&#x27;re going further back into history for Season 4, with the Kar98k sniper rifle making its Modern Warfare 3 debut.

MW3 and Warzone Kar98k release date


The Kar98k will be added to Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 when Season 4 releases on Wednesday, May 29, 2024. 


The gun will then be added to the game and will be unlocked either through the Battle Pass or a set of challenges, which will be confirmed when Activision drops the Season 4 blog before the update. 


Teasers for the Kar98k dropped on May 16, when content creators were sent packages advertising the new season, which included a toy car with the number 98 on it, the tagline &quot;Bolt into action,&quot; a scratch-off portion with the letter &quot;K,&quot; and a section on the back that indicates there are 98 of them in the world. Subtle, I know. 




The Kar98k was an extremely popular option in Warzone Pacific back in 2021, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the new version stacks up. New guns generally dominate the meta to begin with, so I imagine we&#x27;ll be seeing people calling for nerfs on May 30.

Animal Well SNEAK achievement guide


The easiest way to sneak up on a squirrel for the SNEAK trophy is to start a new save file, follow the squirrel that appears in the starting room, and steal its nut. You&#x27;ll go through the usual path of obtaining firecrackers and clearing out any ghosts you find before heading toward the animal statues room. Shortly after, you&#x27;ll find your opportunity to sneak up on the squirrel, knocking out the SNEA…</span>

                              <span>Doubts started to creep in, but it looks as though the next Call of Duty series installment will be coming to Xbox Game Pass after all. 


According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft plans to release the new installment of Call of Duty, rumored to be Black Ops 6, for Game Pass subscribers on launch day. 


Previously, Xbox executives reportedly had reservations about the idea because putting the title on Game Pass would undermine revenue for Activision Blizzard. Currently, Game Pass costs anywhere from $9.99 to $16.99 a month, but day one releases are only available to certain tiers. To offset the potential losses Microsoft allegedly considered raising prices, but it&#x27;s unclear if it intends to follow through with that plan. In comparison, Modern Warfare 3 cost $70 or $100, depending on which edition players purchased. 





This would be the first Call of Duty title on Game Pass. Since finalizing the deal to purchase Activision Blizzard, Microsoft has only recently started to roll out games from the acquisition, like Diablo IV. Microsoft will have to consider whether Game Pass would generate more revenue in the long term than cashing in on one purchase.


As for when players can get their hands on the upcoming title, rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October. The new Call of Duty is expected to be purchased separately on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC. According to the Wall Street Journal report, Activision Blizzard plans to make the official announcement during the Xbox showcase event on June 9.

                              <span>Nothing makes sense anymore. Buying a car to drive to work and driving to work to pay for your car made sense. Now you do that, and you still slide into debt covering the gas and insurance. At least eggs are still cheap, even with inflation.


When I was in college and didn’t have any money, a pack of dry spaghetti was 99 cents. I’d pair it with powdered parmesan cheese. Did you know powdered parmesan cheese usually contains a high amount of cellulose? That’s an anticaking agent made from wood pulp. Sawdust. So, that probably makes it a vegetable, right? Don’t look at me like that. I was a picky eater. I didn’t eat anything close to a balanced diet until I was 25. It was then that I discovered eggs.

                              <span>You thought you were done with Animal Well? It’s not done with you. There’s a whole ‘nother game after your game. After you&#x27;ve dipped your toes, you&#x27;re given a flute with a pretty helpful postgame power: The power to fast travel. Here&#x27;s how to use it.


You can first reach the flute after you gather eight of the eggs. Once you do, return to the Egg Room where all the eggs are displayed. The bottom left door will nudge its way open. Down a corridor, you’ll come to a room with a chest, and inside it is the flute. The flute’s use isn’t immediately clear, but you play notes by holding the tool button and pressing a direction, whether that is through keys or a joystick. You use these directions to input codes which do a variety of different things.


There’s a notation given within Animal Well that you see when you pick up the flute. It labels the eight directions, appropriately 1-8.


1 is set to the right direction, and then it continues clockwise. Down-right is therefore 2, down is 3, down-right is 4, and so on until you get to 8 (up-right). I’m going to use this notation, because it’s both easier to write and also how its displayed in Animal Well’s game-speak.


Some (maybe all) codes are hidden in the environment, but others are completely unknown. Players are still figuring these out, but I’ve put together a list to the best of my abilities. Most of these were discovered by the community.


Fast Travel Codes


One of the most useful functions of the flute in Animal Well is to allow you to fast travel around the map.



Lower warp room: 1-7-5-3-5-3-5-3


Upper warp room: 1-1-5-5-3-3-7-7


Top of the well: 2-6-2-6-2-6-2-6


Left jungle room: 1-8-1-3-1-4-4-1


Secret jungle room: 6-7-2-3-4-3-5-3


Firecracker room: 1-3-5-7-1-3-6-8-1-3-5-7-2-4-6-8


Central Flame Room: 1-7-8-7-3-5-4-3


Giant bunny room: 2-4-3-5-6-5-7-6

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s Parks Fest event features five new cupcake recipes, several cosmetic and furniture additions, and a few quests to spice things up. You&#x27;ll also find three new village duties, with Sweet Samaritan being one you can finish within a day or two with enough time and dedication.


Sweet Samaritan duty guide in Disney Dreamlight Valley


Completing the Sweet Samaritan duty during the Dreamlight Parks Fest event requires baking and gifting 50 cupcakes. Below are the five cupcake types that count toward this duty:



Mermaid Cupcake


Minnie Cupcake


Princess Aurora Raspberry Cupcake


Spaceship Earth Cupcake


Stitch Cupcake



However, baking them is only half of the battle. Once you make all 50 cupcakes, you&#x27;ll have to gift each to various Dreamlight Valley villagers. Only after you give every cupcake away will you complete the Sweet Samaritan duty and receive your reward.

Although it doesn&#x27;t matter which of these five cupcakes you make for the Sweet Samaritan duty, your best bet is to complete your Dreamlight Parks Fest event&#x27;s daily quests. Each day, you&#x27;ll receive quests from five villagers asking you to bake cupcakes and gift them to others. If you finish all five missions, you&#x27;ll receive 20 green buttons and reach the halfway point of the duty. From here, you can either wait until the next day to complete more quests or make 25 more cupcakes and gift them.


Once you gift your last cupcake, you&#x27;re ready to complete the duty. To get your prize, head back into your Dreamlight duties menu, pick the Village subcategory, and select the Sweet Samaritan duty to get the Magic Kingdom Map wall banner.

As such, we&#x27;ve compiled everything we know about this year&#x27;s game, including when it&#x27;ll launch and which platforms it will be available for.


When will Madden 25 release?

As expected, EA has confirmed via digital store listings like Steam that Madden NFL 25 will launch this August; specifically, August 16. This means it will come out a month after EA Sports College Football 25, another American football sim from EA.


What platforms will Madden 25 release for?


Unsurprisingly, Madden NFL 25 is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Aside from being the most current platforms, this has been the case for the last sev…</span>

                              <span>When you think about the age of Minecraft, it&#x27;s tempting to just round up to it being roughly a decade old, maybe a little bit more. Despite its huge impact on the gaming industry – retaining a dominant position for years – it&#x27;s easy to forget that Mojang&#x27;s sandbox sensation is older than many of us can recall.


Wikipedia has it down as a game that came out in 2011, which would make it around 13 years old (or it will be in November). That puts it on par with Skyrim. But that&#x27;s just taking into account the final release. Just before that, Minecraft had a beta version and before that still, it was very much in its alpha phase.




That particular build of the game was released unto the world on May 17, 2009. That puts it at roughly 15 years old, at the time of this writing. The story goes t…</span>

The Dresden Files books and other media are centered on the adventures and cases of Harry Dresden, a wizard and private investigator available for hire in modern day Chicago. The series was dreamed up and written by Jim Butcher, who by his own admission (in the author&#x27;s note of Dead Beat) took the heroes from his own favorite books, like Gandalf from Lord of the Rings and Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon, the 1930 novel written by Dashiell Hammett, and combined them to create his very own magically cable, crime-solving hero.

                              <span>With Hades, I feel safe accusing developer Supergiant Games of creating narrative games that just so happen to have rogue-lite elements. Hades games are rich in dialogue, much of which you may never hear. One Hades 2 player discovered some rare dialogue already but through some more, eh, extraordinary means. 


On the official Hades subreddit, a user named Diplayer1 managed to get to the final fight on the first night — with a bit of help, anyhow. They used an invincibility mod to bully their way past many of the obstacles the early game throws in your way, just to see what happens when you do. 


Note: Everything from here on is a Hades 2 spoiler. If you haven&#x27;t completed at least one run of the game, proceed onward at your own risk.

                              <span>The first puzzle in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes tells you everything you need to know about the game. You&#x27;ll make your way to the front gate, discover it&#x27;s locked, and then figure out how to unlock it with pretty much no instructions. 


Don&#x27;t worry. This puzzle is easier to solve than it first looks. I spent 10 minutes walking around the opening area, confused about what I was supposed to be doing before I saw my first flash of color. Then things started to fall into place. If you&#x27;re struggling with how to open the front gate in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, then I&#x27;ve got you covered here.

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut is now out and about on PC, sadly with the requirement of signing into a PlayStation Network (PSN) account in order to play the samurai action-adventure’s Legends co-op mode. The same requirement, you might recall, that Helldivers 2 players recently lobbied Sony into abandoning. No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

                              <span>“In one of Nero’s many manifests,” reads a books in surreal puzzle-box Lorelei And The Laser Eyes, referring to its eccentric (read: tastefully deranged) antag-artist, “there is a satirical proposal claiming that only dictators should be allowed to direct films.” Developers Simogo - of well-deserved Sayonara Wild Hearts and Device 6 acclaim - seem to agree that’s a position worth satirising. Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

I will solve this problem.&quot; And then I thought, &quot;Actually, no. That sounds hard.&quot; So, instead, here are some wazzock-tier ramblings.

                              <span>Creative Assembly, the studio best known for their strategy Total War series, are rumoured to be working on a licensed Star Wars title. ‘Rumoured’ is the key word here, mind. Dualshockers credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.

                              <span>You might remember Enotria: The Last Song as the Italian-inspired Soulslike that shifted its release date from June to August to avoid Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree... but found itself nestled next to Black Myth: Wukong. Well, scratch that August release, as now it&#x27;s been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there&#x27;s a demo coming out real soon that&#x27;ll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game&#x27;s like. I imagine it&#x27;ll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they&#x27;ve decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls&#x27; bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man&#x27;s stats were specced high.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare&#x27;s big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I&#x27;m particularly proud of. I&#x27;m not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there&#x27;s a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It&#x27;s a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it&#x27;s very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there&#x27;s at least one item on there I&#x27;d push back on, but also this isn&#x27;t really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night&#x27;s work. There is a catch though.

                              <span>Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the Principality of Sealand, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude’s Endless Legend, which is 100% off on Steam  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.

Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has opened a new student-taught class which delves into the game design of the Fire Emblem series. Yes, Fire Emblem. At university. And there we were thinking that &#x27;Film Studies&#x27; sounded cool.
&#x27;Fire Emblem Design and Analysis&#x27; will be getting underway at Carnegie Mellon in the Fall semester of this year and promises to help students &quot;gain a deeper understanding of the game design, mechanics and writing of the Fire Emblem series&quot;. To do this, the class will be examining such topics as the evolution of game mechanics (durability and the weapon triangle both get a shoutout), unit archetypes and series lore before being graded via in-class quizzes and projects.

The years straddling the turn of the millennium were tumultuous for Sega and its fans. The launch of the Dreamcast in 1999 following a series of hardware missteps and company infighting was exciting, but the system failed to gain sufficient traction despite its innovations and array of patented blue-sky software. News in early 2001 that Sega would quit the hardware business to develop games on other platforms rocked fans to the core, but within a matter of months the company&#x27;s debut GameCube title — adapted from the arcade original that debuted in June &#x27;01 — would demonstrate that, despite Dreamcast&#x27;s demise, Sega&#x27;s inimitable arcade style and spirit was alive and well.
Super Monkey Ball felt like a mission statement when it arrived as a GameCube launch title. With a premise as zany as it was instantly understandable, you shift a free-floating course below the feet (well, ball) of your monkey to guide them to a goal while collecting bananas. Simple! The game was a blast of colourful arcade fun from Sega veteran Toshihiro Nagoshi and signalled to fans not to worry, everything was going to be just fine.

While part of the Ryzen 8000 series, the 8400F also lacks the Ryzen AI support found in the higher-end SKUs. The Ryzen 5 8400F offers 6 cores / 12 threads, a 4.2GHz base clock and 4.7GHz boost clock, and a 65 Watt TDP while retailing for $169~189 USD. Here are some initial benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen 5 8400F in putting it up against 230+ benchmarks under Linux while also monitoring the CPU power consumption and comparing it to Intel&#x27;s closest contender as the Core i5 1440F that retails for just under $200.</span>

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto VI&#x27;s reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. 
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise&#x27;s parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. 
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two&#x27;s recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).</span>

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director&#x27;s Cut, is out on PC today. It&#x27;s a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve&#x27;s handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It&#x27;s not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that&#x27;s your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

                              <span>Phoenix Labs, the developer behind last year&#x27;s Fae Farm and Dauntless, has laid off staff and canceled in-development games as part of a restructuring at the studio. Polygon&#x27;s Nicole Carpenter is reporting on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 100 people at Phoenix Labs were laid off. 
Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement: 


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019. 
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year. 
Square Enix announced earlier this week it will begin layoffs as part of &quot;structural reforms,&quot; starting this week.

                              <span>EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game&#x27;s full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it&#x27;s being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. 
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.</span>

                              <span>Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new &quot;narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.&quot; The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. 
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today&#x27;s public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It&#x27;s why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. 


&quot;Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The team&#x27;s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision&#x27;s resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. 
&quot;Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.&quot; 
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division, and Far Cry. 
What kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024&#x27;s surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. 
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.</span>

                              <span>You will need an internet connection to install Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. 
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we&#x27;ll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that&#x27;s not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. 


&quot;Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, following some questions we&#x27;ve noticed in the community,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. 

&quot;We are super excited to bring Assassin&#x27;s Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.&quot; 

As you can see, it&#x27;s clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. 
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

                              <span>Patnáctý ročník ne-konference jOpenSpace se koná 4. – 6. října 2024 v Hotelu Antoň v Telči. Pro účast je potřeba vyplnit registrační formulář.

Ne-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tématikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT.

Pokud chcete nasát atmosféru minulých ročníků či ohodnotit kvalitu přednášek, navštivte náš YouTube kanál. Nejoblíbenější z nich právě překonala 22 tisíc shlédnutí.

Co je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.</span>

Dave The Diver&#x27;s next free DLC is just on the horizon, and you better get running, because a kaiju is on the loose.
Godzilla will be stomping its way into the Blue Hole next week, on 23rd May, developer Mintrocket has announced. However, at the bottom of a detailed blog post over on PlayStation.Blog, there&#x27;s a little asterisk mentioning that the &quot;Godzilla Content Pack is a time-limited free DLC, only available from May 23 until November 23 &quot;. It isn&#x27;t quite clear whether it will only be available during that period or will be paid DLC after this period. Still, if you nab it next week, it&#x27;ll be free! So it&#x27;s time to dive in.

If you cast your mind back to April, you might remember that the dice-based tactical RPG Dicefolk was confirmed to be coming to Switch. One month on, publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment and developers LEAP Game Studios and Tiny Ghoul have announced that this monster-catching roguelike will be heading our way on 20th June.
There are a lot of different genre terms going on here, so if you haven&#x27;t come across Dicefolk before, we&#x27;ll do our best to break it down for you (but you should also check out the above explanatory trailer, of course).

The Switch has been a boon for retro gaming enthusiasts for a while. Hamster&#x27;s huge Arcade Archives series has felt right at home on the console, but late last year, a new retro rerelease series entered the fray
EGGCONSOLE is a series of Japanese home computer games that are being ported to Switch by retro specialists D4 Enterprise. This oft-forgotten generation of games is often hard to get your hands on nowadays without a PC, and to see them slowly make their way to Switch has been pretty exciting. This is real gaming history making its way onto consoles, kids.

The latest Japanese charts from Famitsu (via Gematsu) are in and this week paints a pretty familiar picture.
Last week&#x27;s champion, Stellar Blade, takes the trophy once again and stands as the representative of the only non-Switch title in the running. On the flip side, the likes of Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Sweep the Board! have dropped out of the top ten, leaving Mario Kart 8 Deluxe the chance to speed back onto the podium and take second place.

We have seen superhero tactics pop up a couple of times in recent years with the likes of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns and the soon-to-be-released Capes, but Covert Crew is the most nostalgic take we&#x27;ve seen, wearing its classic Fire Emblem inspirations on its sleeve.

Following up the sublime Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster was always going to be tough. Rather than tackle another well-known franchise, Nightdive Studios has wisely chosen to revisit one of the weirdest forgotten gems of the ‘90s with PO’ed: Definitive Edition. Utilising the same principles as Dark Forces, Nightdive’s latest project breathes fresh air into the Any Channel-developed FPS which debuted on 3DO, modernising it in all the right ways while maintaining a respectable level of authenticity.
We should stress right from the start, though: this is a weird game, and it won’t be for everybody. The Dark Forces Remaster was based on an already well-known title, and even if you hadn’t played the original, it was crammed full of recognisable imagery from the Star Wars franchise to help ease you into the old-school experience.

Last weekend, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom turned one year old. Nintendo released a special piece of artwork to mark the occasion, the glow-in-the-dark Ultrahand keyring was restocked as a My Nintendo Reward and (to complete this Triforce of anniversary goodies) our wonderful video team sat down for a good old natter about the game after having spent a year with it.
In the above video, Zion, Felix and Alex get into the weeds about their thoughts on Link&#x27;s latest, sharing stories about the game&#x27;s launch day, how much they have played in the 12 months since and the age-old question of how it all compares to Breath of the Wild.

The Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition was recently announced for the Switch and as part of this there will be a special &#x27;Deluxe Set&#x27; released, containing a physical game card, a set of five pins, 13 art cards, and a gold coloured replica NES cartridge.
Nintendo has now released a new trailer showing off this &#x27;Deluxe Set&#x27; and it&#x27;s got us wondering if anyone in the Nintendo Life community will be picking it up, and who has been able to successfully secure a pre-order so far (pre-order links can be found below).

                              <span>There are exactly one million metroidy rogueishy action platform games and that is okay. There&#x27;s no such thing as too many of an entertaining thing in a world with, god I dunno, at least thousand humans in? Maybe more? Who knows.
They are rarely my thing, though. I try more than I really want to, for you, and games like Biomorph give me the energy to keep going through the many that leave me indifferent. This isn&#x27;t one of my grudging admissions that a subgenre isn&#x27;t all bad; it&#x27;s a game that I can&#x27;t even think of a way to complain about.

                              <span>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for Nier, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.
Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, “I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That’s about all I can say for now.” Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

Included in the co-op game’s endless war of attrition to protect Super Earth from bugs, robots, and basic awareness of military propaganda, and included in just having mates. Enter player ‘dremskiy’, whose tragic booting from a private game in which they just wanted to make friends has resulted in so many friend requests that their Steam account won’t accept any more.

We already know that we’re due a sequel at some point the future, thanks to impressive sales. Director Jiwon Choi previously teased some DLC concept art, and now it looks like we’ll be seeing that DLC by the time the year’s out, according to a fiscal report.

                              <span>We’re just a couple of days away from Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director&#x27;s Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after the Helldivers 2 debacle - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.

He’ll be voiced by Critical Role dungeon master Matthew Mercer and haunt a new dungeon map, where you’ll be able to do battle as new elf and bard survivors able to roll a literal d20 when they crack open treasure chests.

One of those heroes will also be the series’ first playable real-life figure: the African samurai Yasuke.

And if that hadn’t already sold me already, developers Studio Camelia are also paying tribute to the best Final Fantasy game: FFIX, obviously.

No you haven’t. You spend weekends eating custard creams and watching Bake Off. You haven’t thought about brutalism since undergrad, be honest. Anyway, my version of that is Starship Troopers. As in, I’ve been waiting for a videogamey excuse to bang on about it in public for ages. Helldivers 2 is obviously as good an excuse as any, but really, I needn’t have waited so long. Official offerings like strategy game Starship Troopers: Terran Command and FPS Robocop: Rogue City aside, I reckon you can find Paul Verhoeven’s fingerprints all over games.

I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough. This is a bold claim, because there are more than 40 to collect.

                              <span>Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

                              <span>The characters in Read Only Memories: Neurodiver are deeply into anime. They love manga and figurines and trashy movies and horror novels. The interests of the game&#x27;s creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel&#x27;s loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime&#x27;s commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game&#x27;s name (&quot;Neurodiver!&quot;). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

                              <span>Last week, I watched one of my favourite badminton players Kento Momota play his final match. As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn&#x27;t know me - of course he doesn&#x27;t - and I don&#x27;t know him. But for ten years I&#x27;d watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn&#x27;t only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a &#x27;game&#x27; of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

                              <span>I have a couple of takes on Nico Papalia&#x27;s new RPG Athenian Rhapsody, which launched on Steam yesterday and still has a demo. The first is that it&#x27;s a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox&#x27;s Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn&#x27;t so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice.

                              <span>Wayfinder, currently a free-to-play RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, is undergoing a pretty drastic change in its upcoming Echoes patch. Right now it&#x27;s a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it&#x27;ll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that&#x27;s alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It&#x27;s often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.

                              <span>The Sims 4 is nothing if not a teetering jenga tower of updates and add-ons and DLC packs, and the latter half of 2024 will be no exception for EA&#x27;s life sim king. Yesterday saw the release of an update to the base game&#x27;s swimwear, kicking off the updates teased in the recently-revealed new roadmap, Season Of Love. The roadmap video&#x27;s vibe is that it and its partner saw you from across the bar and wondered if you&#x27;d be interested in joining them, and it kind of weirds me out.

                              <span>I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you&#x27;re talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm&#x27;s perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to &quot;take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results&quot;. Other developers have heeded the call. Here&#x27;s a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0&#x27;s (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

                              <span>Old-school FPS adventure The Explorator contains much more intense shooty violence than the adorable lizardy folk that populate it might immediately suggest. I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.

Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it&#x27;s finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders. And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.

If so, you&#x27;ll probably love the smell of Valheim&#x27;s Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing. Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I&#x27;d even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you&#x27;ll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly. Shout-out in particular for the monster that resembles a combusting sink clog with spider legs. Very Possum-esque.

                              <span>Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. 
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn&#x27;t mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. 
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.</span>

                              <span>After teasing its reveal earlier this week, Ubisoft has officially unveiled Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan&#x27;s first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn&#x27;t too surprising given it&#x27;s Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate – but it&#x27;s exciting nonetheless.

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game&#x27;s approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here). 
Shortly after the preview, I had a chance to dig deeper into Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble with several of the devel…</span>

                              <span>HBO/Max has released the first look at Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in Season 2 of The Last of Us, and the scenery looks familiar. As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today&#x27;s images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year. 
Pascal&#x27;s Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game&#x27;s beginning where snow is abundant. 
Check out the first official look at Season 2 of The Last of Us for yourself below: 

Pascal and Ramsey are obviously returning cast members for the series, and they&#x27;ll be joined by various newcomers in the show next year. Booksmart&#x27;s Kaitlyn …</span>

                              <span>Hi-Fi Rush is getting one final patch today to address some minor issues in the game. Plus, the Hi-Fi Rush X (formerly Twitter) account has reconfirmed a physical edition of the game is coming from Limited Run Games. 
This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game&#x27;s developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won&#x27;t be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today&#x27;s patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit. 
Thank you all for your continued support.

The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox&#x27;s own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it&#x27;s about keeping the business healthy in the long-term.

The first Mortal Kombat movie in this rebooted film series hit theaters on April 23, 2021, and Game Informer had a great time with it – read our 8 out of 10 review to find out why here. Here&#x27;s hoping we enjoy the sequel just as much, if not more. 
Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid will return to direct Mortal Kombat 2, and it will be written by a new writer, Jeremy Slater (alongside McQuoid), who wrote Disney&#x27;s Moon Knight series. Alongside returning cast and characters, The Boys Karl Urban will join the fight as Johnny Cage.

                              <span>A group of former XCOM and Civilisation developers have co-founded a new studio, Midsummer Studios, who plan to “revitalise the life sim genre” with their debut release. The latter doesn’t have a title yet, and is described as “a next-gen Life Sim that emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” According to former XCOM and Marvel’s Midnight Suns director Jake Solomon, it’s “focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”

                              <span>Tucked away in a corner of 1999&#x27;s Yosuka, Japan-set open world sim Shenmue there&#x27;s a convenience store, or &quot;konbini&quot;, where you can buy stuff like carrot juice, take part in raffles, and fritter away the hours listening to the shop jingle - an absolute die-cast classic of the genre in that you&#x27;ll probably be humming the tune before you realise that you&#x27;ve even heard it. Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. &quot;Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it&#x27;s always raining,&quot; he tells me. &quot;But there&#x27;s one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!&quot;

                              <span>My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam&#x27;s acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He&#x27;s a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I&#x27;ve been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I&#x27;d say I got my teeth into it, but I&#x27;m not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it&#x27;s release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it&#x27;s drawn for itself.  

It&#x27;s balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam&#x27;s first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I&#x27;d feared, when you&#x27;re playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

                              <span>I booted up Dread Delusion and fell 30 feet to my death. This throwback first-person RPG is hazardous, and not only due to the dreamlike islands floating in the sky. My leg-snappin&#x27; plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

                              <span>Buckle up. A bunch of players are competing to cross the finish line of a brutally difficult tower of racetracks in racing game Trackmania, with a prize pool of $30,000 waiting for the first three drivers to reach the top. The course is a huge, winding gauntlet made of pieces suspended in midair, and even expert players have fallen from their positions over 1000 times, their cars hurtling back to the bottom of the tower to start again. The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising. They are 11 days into the event.

I may leave little insights scattered throughout. A Paper Trail, if you will. A puzzle game named Paper Trail that has you solve discrete head-scratchers by folding the screen like a piece of paper in different ways to create new paths, I might even say, if I were trying to cram a bunch of information right at the top without breaking theme. Let’s talk about it.

So it’s with all the awe and appreciation in the world that I dove into the demo for retro RPG Whispers In The Moss. It&#x27;s been in development for twelve years, from solo dev Uncultured Games. It&#x27;s set in a vaguely ancient Rome-inspired fantasy world brought to life through intricate and inventive ASCII, and scored with homages to the classics. Ah, but how does it play? You exclaim with evident interest, I assume.

                              <span>Genuinely legendary game designer Ron Gilbert – whose works include the classic adventure game Monkey Island, the RTS Total Annihilation (as producer), and the term “cutscenes” – is making a new game.
The Terrible Toybox website describes it as “Classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park”, and one of the other people working on it is Elissa Black, co-designer and writer of the wonderful Objects In Space… who is also, I’ve just learned from her personal website, working on a retro 90s style turn-based spaceship command game influenced by the 1971 mainframe adaptation of Star Trek. Argh, so many good things in one article.

                              <span>As promised and/or threatened, depending on your perspective, open world game Fallout 4 has gotten some new graphics tweaks and bug fixes to smooth out the bumps caused by its previous “next gen update”. The update broke a bunch of mods, delayed a few interesting overhaul projects like Fallout London, and generally made everyone shake their fists at the sky and shout “Howaaaard!” Remember folks: auteur theory unduly credits a single creative for a group effort - the dice that Todd rolls every time he decides whether or not to break the game are also clearly to blame here.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played little of legendary survival sim The Long Dark, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I&#x27;ve sampled enough to know that adding a &quot;Misery Mode&quot; to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that&#x27;s just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what&#x27;s this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you&#x27;re fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.


It&#x27;s not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It&#x27;s not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you&#x27;ll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.

                              <span>Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch &quot;later this month&quot;, say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë&#x27;s dash and sprint work. We don&#x27;t know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer&#x27;s &quot;distinct style&quot;.

                              <span>A while back Ubisoft revealed about a billion Assassin&#x27;s Creed projects. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was Mirage, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it&#x27;s an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, and it&#x27;s getting an &quot;official cinematic world premiere trailer&quot; debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.
Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.

What I&#x27;m trying to say is, Mullet Mad Jack is fashionable and no-nonsense, which makes for a great hang if you&#x27;d like to burn some aggression once in a while.

                              <span>The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. 
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. 


Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

From providing the voice of Rucks in Bastion to Red&#x27;s titular Transistor to Hades himself, Cunningham has played a vital part of every Supergiant title. In this rare interview, we ask Logan how he entered the world of voice acting, how he joined Supergiant Games, and which characters are his favorites to play (and which he&#x27;d want to redo). 
Game Informer: When did you first discover that you were good at creating or imitating voices?
Logan Cunningham: I don&#x27;t think there was ever a moment that I discovered that. I always did that. From when I was a kid, my brother and I, we would record stupid little...…</span>

                              <span>Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by Fleabag star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year&#x27;s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon&#x27;s Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. 
This series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a &quot;single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft&#x27;s story in the Tomb Raider series.&quot; 
&quot;With great IP, the possibilities are endless,&quot; Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. &quot;The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft&#x27;s adventures. We&#x27;re honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we&#x27;re looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.&quot; 
This is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix&#x27;s animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. 
If you&#x27;re curious about Crystal Dynamics&#x27; recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

                              <span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game&#x27;s core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.
The books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console&#x27;s launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. 
Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn&#x27;t hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. 


At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4&#x27;s 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation&#x27;s fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. 
On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year.

                              <span>Jake Solomon, former long-time Firaxis designer and director who spearheaded Marvel’s Midnight Suns and was a lead designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has announced he’s formed a new company following his departure from Firaxis last February. Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. 
Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.


The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” 
“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”
Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.</span>

                              <span>Paper Trail is a neat upcoming indie game, especially if you&#x27;re into papercraft. The adventure stars Paige (get it?), a young girl with the power to fold reality like it&#x27;s made out of paper. She uses this ability to run away from home in pursuit of her dreams, with players solving origami-focused pathfinding puzzles to get her from one scenic locale to the next. Join editors Marcus Stewart, Kyle Hilliard, and Wesley LeBlanc as they take a look at the opening chapter of this pleasant and mind-bending journey.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is PlayStation&#x27;s fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Developer Arrowhead Game Studios&#x27; live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game&#x27;s console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. 


Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. 
As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!
@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…
May 14, 2024
Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.

                              <span>Sony has appointed Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino as dual CEOs of PlayStation, following Jim Ryan&#x27;s departure from the company this spring; they will begin June 1. Ryan announced he was leaving PlayStation last year, with Sony Group Corporation COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki stepping in as interim CEO following his departure in March. After that brief stint, PlayStation is tackling the CEO position with two figures, each with different focuses. 
Hulst has been appointed CEO of SIE&#x27;s Studio Business Group while Nishino has been appointed CEO of SIE&#x27;s Platform Business Group. Totoki, now through as interim CEO, will serve as a Chairman of SIE in addition to returning to his role as COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Both Nishino and Hulst will report to Totoki.

Of those surveyed, however, 41% consumed content from illegal sources in 2023, up from 39% in the previous year.

                              <span>Last week, The Joker was announced as the first new fighter joining MultiVersus ahead of its upcoming relaunch this month. The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.
The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn. 


MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.</span>

                              <span>Atlus has announced that the original version of Shin Megami Tensei V will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13. That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.
On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the best-selling game in the series in January 2022.
The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.
May 13, 2024
Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game (including all DLC) but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons. Think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V. Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.
Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game here, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V here.</span>

                              <span>Update, 5/13/24:
The Rogue Prince of Persia, the upcoming roguelike from Dead Cells developer Evil Empire, will double-jump into Early Access on May 27. This new release date follows a delay from the original May 14 release date as a result of Hades II, which is gracing the latest cover of Game Informer, launching into Early Access last week. 
Evil Empire delayed The Rogue Prince of Persia&#x27;s Early Access launch to give its team members, their mothers, and players around the world more time with Hades II. The team said at the time The Rogue Prince of Persia would still hit Early Access this month, and now we know it&#x27;s May 27. 
The Rogue Prince of Persia&#x27;s new release date is 27th May! If you didn&#x27;t see our previous post, the TLDR is to give people time to play Hades 2, including us😄

Layoffs such as these were suspected following Square Enix&#x27;s latest financial earnings report, which includes a three-year company reboot plan with an &quot;aggressive&quot; multiplatform release strategy after a slide mentioned &quot;structural reforms.&quot; You can see the slide below:

Ubisoft announced on X that the game’s cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft’s use of the word “cinematic” suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that’s the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its Ubisoft Forward presentation less than a month later, on June 10.

Assassin’s Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate &quot;shinobi fantasy.&quot; It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.</span>

                              <span>To avoid spending decades in a U.S. prison, last summer Megaupload coders Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk received sentences of 2.5 years in New Zealand as part of a plea deal. Kim Dotcom says the men are already free after providing &quot;false confessions&quot; for use against him. After eight years, the criminal case against him in the U.S. showed action recently, with secret orders handed down by the court. Dotcom predicts a new raid and revocation of his bail.

                              <span>The last few weeks I’ve been watching quite a few YouTube videos (thanks, Evo Japan), and noticing that adverts during videos a) seem to pop up every 30 seconds or so and b) then last for an unskippable 30 to 60 seconds. My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.

Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.

                              <span>The story of Manor Lords’ soundtrack begins, as all inspiring tales do, with hunched-over late-night doom scrolling. It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

On the other hand, Google’s algorithms don’t like it when you spend whole intros handwringing about Google’s algorithms, either, so let’s stop, er, faffing around and speak of Doom. Id Software parent company Zenimax recently trademarked “IDKFA”, a string of letters that will be of deep significance to original Doom players, and which may therefore be evidence of an impending announcement.

                              <span>Like with getting fancy polyhedral dice sets full of all glitter and wool, buying and owning are two different hobbies when it comes to books. I think this has gotten worse (if that&#x27;s the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It&#x27;s really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption&#x27;s sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).

                              <span>The former lead writer of charming super-fascist simulator Helldivers 2 is working on a strategy and tactics RPG in the vein of Nintendo and Intelligent System&#x27;s Fire Emblem games, which aren&#x27;t available on PC and as such, are a complete mystery to you, a lifelong desktop warrior who would sooner cut their hand off than suffer it to brush against one of those filthy Nintendo witches, I mean Switches. 


To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that&#x27;s what. Beyond that, we can only dream.

                              <span>ROBOBEAT is the third one of these new-fangled rhythm FPS games I’ve played - after BPM: Bullets Per Minute and Metal: Hellsinger - and the first one I’ve actually clicked with. The concept evidently appeals to me enough to try out those other two, but I guess that I’m simply too much of a rebel-maverick-disruptor to play to the stiflingly enforced rhythms of somebody else’s drum. Something about ROBOBEAT’s roguelike shooting feels different though.

Much like Scorn, Necrophosis is also part-inspired by the dystopian surrealist works of Zdzisław Beksiński, which means lots of plucking brains out of sinewy bodies and plopping them into fleshy receptacles. There&#x27;s a demo out now and while it&#x27;s not outstanding, it tickled my curiosity more than I thought it would.

                              <span>Back in the late 90s when all of you NORMIES were playing Diablo, I was playing a little-known Konami ARPG called Azure Dreams, which has alas never escaped PlayStation prison. It&#x27;s a grid-based, upwardly mobile roguelitey dungeon crawler set in a big tower, each floor a semi-randomised maze of monsters (which you can capture), traps and pick-ups, where player and creature actions happen simultaneously.
Effort Star&#x27;s Enter The Chronosphere doesn&#x27;t have grids or monster capturing, that I know of, but it taps into a comparable vein of diorama-sized frantic-yet-laidback challenge, with characters, foes and projectiles frozen in time till you give a command. There&#x27;s a demo on Steam as part of the platform&#x27;s Endless Replayability Fest, which I encourage you to try, whether you are one of the COOL KIDS who played Azure Dreams or not.

The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. &quot;There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once,&quot; say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis.

Little-Known Galaxy is out in a week, and currently has a demo on Steam, where you can sample many of the delights that you&#x27;re used to from a Stardewlike when you&#x27;re new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It&#x27;s an intriguing proposition.

                              <span>Brass-blasting rhythm game Trombone Champ honked its way into our hearts when it released in 2022. Since then, it&#x27;s garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this Final Fantasy 7 mod. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.

                              <span>Samurai action-adventure Ghost Of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut is due to launch on PC this coming Thursday, May 16th - but it&#x27;ll be available on Steam in nearly 180 fewer countries than expected. That&#x27;s because its online features will require players to sign-in to a PSN account, and PSN accounts are not available in those countries.

                              <span>Warner Bros., owners of the now-defunct Adult Swim Games publishing label, have contacted some developers about returning ownership of their game&#x27;s Steam pages. The developers of both Small Radios Big Televisions and Duck Game shared the news on X yesterday.

                              <span>At various times, most social media platforms have received criticism for alleged failure to prevent distribution of copyright-infringing content. Few, however, have been threatened with widespread blocking more often than Telegram. In a row that seemed ready to boil over last year, Telegram was given an ultimatum by the Malaysian government; come to the negotiating table or face the consequences.

The film is due to be released in 2025 but the allegedly leaked material, posted in an Instagram story by a well-known &#x27;scooper&#x27;, clearly has Disney and Marvel concerned. Through a DMCA subpoena, the movie companies aim to find out who&#x27;s behind the social media account.

Indika is bizarre, surprising, and captivating. It made me question its reality almost as often as its titular protagonist, a young nun tormented by the Devil, doubts her faith. This odd adventure from its aptly named developer Odd Meter may lack some design polish, but the fascinating tale at its core instilled enough faith in me to see it through to the end. 
The game unfolds in early 19th-century Russia. Indika is treated as an outcast at her monastery, and, for some reason, she’s re…</span>

                              <span>Ever since it came to Switch at the tail end of last summer, Vampire Survivors has been my plane game. Sure, other run-based indies like Balatro and Dead Cells, all-encompassing triple-A titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and retro compilations like Sonic Origins and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, have shared that title, but I always know that when I need to pass time on a flight, no game does so as effectively as Vampire Survivors. Logically, I know that each run will last, at most, 30 minutes, but for some reason, it never feels that way. And because of that, I look down for what feels like 20 minutes, and when I look up, 2 hours have passed.
I travel a lot, so I play Vampire Survivors fairly regularly. Still, each time I turn on the game, developer Poncle ha…</span>

                              <span>Marvel Studios has cast Ralph Ineson as the planet-eating Galactus for The Fantastic Four. PlayStation 5 players might recognize that name as the voice of Cidolfus Telamon, aka Cid, in Final Fantasy XVI. This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. 
Ineson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s first film about Marvel&#x27;s First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).


Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. 
If you&#x27;ve played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can&#x27;t wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year&#x27;s Hi-Fi Rush. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. 
However, four days later, Bloomberg&#x27;s Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. 


Here&#x27;s what Bond said: 
Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox&#x27;s own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond&#x27;s answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: 
While it&#x27;s great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you&#x27;d expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.
For more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike.

                              <span>It&#x27;s once again just about time for a new Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion to hit store shelves. Continuing the Scarlet &amp; Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.
As such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. 
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I&#x27;ll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.
You can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.

 Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24. For more on the long-running Pokémon Trading Card Game, including other galleries from past expansions, head to our Pokémon TCG hub at the banner below!</span>

                              <span>Spacefaring RTS Homeworld 3 is good sci-fi. Monolithic structures scorched with plasma burns. Sleek spacecraft. Alien sunrises.  It’s also good sci-fi because its characters converse through reams of inscrutable but cool-sounding space science, and at no point does a grinning quipster tell a scientist: “Whoa there, professor. Why don’t you try saying that again... but in English!” Basically, if your wishlist for Homeworld 3 has tone and atmosphere at the top, rest easy. At no point did I get the sense that Blackbird ever took making the first proper Homeworld in eight years lightly.

                              <span>What is it Wendy Cope wrote? “Bloody Fallout 4 patches are like bloody buses. You wait half  a decade for one, and as soon as that one breaks everything, Bethesda releases another just days later.” Yeah, pretty sure that’s it. Anyway, Fallout 4 will get another patch for the near decade-old game next week, presumably to help fix a lot of the problems its long-awaited “next-gen update” introduced two weeks ago.

                              <span>The Rogue Prince of Persia, a game that is pleasingly candid in choosing its name for a roguelite Prince of Persia spin-off, has been delayed. It turns out that developers Evil Empire - they of very good roguelite platformer Dead Cells - saw the Hades 2 train steaming down the tracks, and decided to sensibly dodge-roll out of its way.

This time, it’s not horror video games or scary movies serving as inspiration for DBD’s next chapter, but 50-year-old tabletop fantasy RPG Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

And by ‘spread it out’ I mean maybe play 15% less Total Warhammer. As is often the way of things, I followed what I thought was prudent advice, and now there are bugs everywhere. Big bugs. Also, robots. Helldivers 2, it turns out, is really quite excellent. Who woulda thunk! Everyone else. Everyone else woulda thunk.

During the quest for a new flat - a quest I would slot somewhere between return to Ravenholm in Half-Life 2 and the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief: Deadly Shadows in terms of overall hopefulness and unpleasant surprises - I toyed briefly with the idea of living in a mobile home.
You can find all kinds of weirdo moving property on Gumtree - houseboats, caravans, yurts, large coats, coffins - but they all share the disadvantage of being cramped and more expensive than described and inadequate to the power and internet needs of a Maxed-Out Videogame Journalist. If I&#x27;d seen a house with chicken legs, though? It&#x27;d have been worth the sacrifice. Just think, whenever James Archer gives me grief about my performance in Lethal Company I could send my house to step on him.

                              <span>Open world fantasy RPG Runes emits a deeply powerful aura. I can tell it’s deeply powerful because MSI Afterburner’s fan control immediately went mental after I loaded up its free Steam combat demo. What do you mean ‘unoptimised’? That alarming sound is simply my computer shaking with awe at the fearless flippancy required to leave enemies fully untextured so they resemble Metal Gear Solid’s cyborg ninja. The promise of an indie fantasy RPG drew me in, but I must admit, I almost didn’t bother writing about this upon learning the demo is just a pre-Kickstarter combat slice. But something about it entrances me. What it lacks in textures, it makes up for in sheer moxy. You can’t optimise moxy! You can either make MSI shudder in terror or you can’t.

That&#x27;s right, the upcoming Frostline DLC adds the Sakhal archipelago, home to a rugged environment where you&#x27;ll battle against the cold and attempt to shoot nasty players at the same time. Oh, there are also volcanoes that prove an extra threat, too. And new diseases. Wonderful.

                              <span>Former Microsoft senior PR manager Brad Hilderbrand has blogged about the recent closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, making a familiar case that Microsoft’s gaming division are now expected “to cut expenses to the bone” in the wake of the wildly expensive acquisition of Activision Blizzard and amid slowing growth of the Game Pass subscription business. In Hilderbrand’s view, Game Pass will likely never be sustainable or profitable. Microsoft’s only chance on this front, he says, is “to put all the world&#x27;s biggest games on the service” – namely, Call of Duty, which still earns hundreds of millions annually in direct sales, or GTA 6, which, hahahaha.

Well, no excuses now*. Fanatical are doing a thing where you can buy FPS imsim Prey and two others from a respectable selection for a fiver.

                              <span>Role-playing musical Stray Gods is getting DLC in which you&#x27;ll play as sorrowful ghostly rocker Orpheus, the developers have announced. You briefly meet Orpheus in the base game while playing as leatherclad muse Grace, finding him moping in the underworld, eyes dripping with glam rock mascara. In the DLC he makes a musical comeback on earth, alongside messenger god Hermes. I&#x27;ve not stumbled on Orpheus in the other mythical game of this season, Hades 2 (he showed up in the first Hades but there&#x27;s no sign he&#x27;s reappearing in the sequel). So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall&#x27;s expansion when it comes out this summer.

                              <span>Copyright holders can claim damages for copyright infringements that occurred years or even decades ago, the U.S. Supreme Court has clarified. In a majority decision, the Court rejected the lower court&#x27;s argument that there&#x27;s a three-year time limit for damages. Older claims are fair game, as long as the lawsuit is filed within three years of &#x27;discovering&#x27; an infringement.

                              <span>The Premier League has obtained a new blocking order in the UK, targeting three pirate sites receiving over 20 million visits per month. One of the targets is SportsHub, a site that&#x27;s now generating enough traffic to make it one of the UK&#x27;s top 1,000 most-visited sites, period. The surge in traffic coincides with a UK anti-piracy campaign that aims to deter consumption of pirated football streams.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss our Hades II cover story trip to Supergiant Games in San Francisco and Xbox shutting down four game studios, including Prey, Dishonored, and Redfall developer Arkane Austin, alongside Tango Gameworks, the team behind The Evil Within series and last year&#x27;s critically-acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush. Afterward, we chat about Shuntaro Furukawa, President of Nintendo, revealing the company will reveal details about the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s successor within this fiscal year via a post on X. Before diving into our positive reviews of &#x27;90s-survival-horror Crow Country and Little Kitty, Big City, special guest Charlie Wacholz joins us to chat about his Animal Well review, in which he calls Bigmode&#x27;s first published title &quot;a masterclass in environmental design.&quot;

In a message posted to the game’s website and social media channels yesterday, Lightforge cites a lack of publisher funding as the reason it no longer has the means to continue work on Project O.R.C.S. To minimize any prolonged struggle, the team decided to immediately pull the plug.

                              <span>Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that&#x27;s not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.


Orpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn&#x27;t clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.
As for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. &quot;When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?&quot; it reads. &quot;Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?&quot;

Stray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date &quot;coming soon.&quot; For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made. For more Greek mythology, visit our Hades II coverage hub for this month&#x27;s exclusive coverage.</span>

He said this during Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s Q1 financial results call, noting its games revenue declined a lot compared to last year, as reported by IGN. 
Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was likely never going to perform well for Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s gaming division compared to the sector&#x27;s revenue last year, which was anchored in the release of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game of 2023 and the first non-Call of Duty game to take that spot in years. Still, as critics and players will tell you, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League was a disappointing release from Rocksteady Studios, the team behind the Batman: Arkham series – you can read Game…</span>

                              <span>After facing criticism for its unusually high piracy rates, in 2016 Australia began blocking pirate sites. The latest injunction, targeting around three dozen streaming sites, was handed down by the Federal Court this week, mostly in favor of Hollywood, Netflix, and Apple. In all likelihood, Australia&#x27;s blocking successes will be presented to Congress in 2024, in support of a site-blocking legislation drive in the U.S. But what does success actually look like?

See, these are the kinds of glacial changes of focus and ponderous shifts of strategy you often get at very large videogame publishers such as Microsoft. Trends are cyclical and corporations are sort of just these massive, sleepy hamsters, trundling around the wheel to rediscover practices and projects they once deemed bad for business. Hang on, let me go look up &quot;yesterday&quot; in the dictionary and fetch some sellotape - my brain appears to have exploded.

The game in question is cheery co-op shooter Helldivers 2, over which Aunty Sony recently upended a can of furious worms by abruptly insisting that Steam players have a PSN account for security reasons and so, blocking players in regions where PSN isn&#x27;t available. Sony have subsequently walked back the requirement following a backlash of truly hellish proportions, though I understand that the game remains unavailable on Steam in certain regions. By comparison, Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt&#x27;s remarks overnight that the developers might have been &quot;removing the fun&quot; with their gun balancing seem pretty innocuous.

                              <span>In the grand tradition established by one (1) prior release, Supergiant dropped Hades 2 over the weekend and we at the Electronic Wireless show podcast have all been playing and enjoying it bunches! So we wanted to talk about the game, why we&#x27;re enjoying it, some of the new aspects over Hades the first, and just generally go &#x27;Ooh, this game is fun, innit?&#x27;. Not a complex podcast this week.
James isn&#x27;t here, so Nate makes up some hardware news that&#x27;s very exciting and yet disturbing, while he does have a mythology-themed mini game in the tower of jocularity. Plus: the games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, including a cute survival horror and RimWorld, still. Also, Nate asks me to explain what the hap was heckening with Helldivers 2, and if Joel remains safe.

                              <span>When I asked Tango Gameworks creative director John Johanas whom he&#x27;d give Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s Best Audio trophy away to at this year&#x27;s GDC Awards, he said he&#x27;d split it between the game&#x27;s audio team and &quot;the person who taught me everything I know&quot; - Shinji Mikami, Tango&#x27;s founder and one of the erstwhile Capcom and Platinum big brains behind Resident Evil, Vanquish and much more besides. I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami&#x27;s shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010.

                              <span>Computers have always been animal wells, in a sense. They&#x27;re havens for creatures of many shapes and degrees of literalness, all the way down to the metal. As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find &quot;worms&quot;, like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and &quot;gophers&quot;, a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take &quot;browser&quot;, derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous.

                              <span>My older brother (as opposed to &quot;big&quot;; my younger brother is my big brother, because he&#x27;s built like the kind of hearty giant in a JRPG who laughs a lot and carries an anchor as a weapon, while my older brother is a loathsome scribbling wizard like myself) is a gamer in a very normal sense. He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn&#x27;t like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.
I won&#x27;t tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - &quot;liking Apollo&quot; was a key part of his personality. It&#x27;s interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn&#x27;t even aware it was happening.

                              <span>How to best describe strategy game Be the Ruler: Britannia when its alchemic reduction of traditionally full-on genres is what drew me to its free Steam prologue in the first place? A less demanding Manor Lords? A more casual Crusader Kings III? Total War with training wheels? It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is. I know what it is, and most days I wish I’d saved that brain space to e.g learn how to keep house plants alive instead.

You can plant crops, hire watering robots, harvest blueberry bushes, raise pigs, all while validating the spreadsheets from Paula in accounts. Paula! Where are the running totals!? I can&#x27;t find the running t- oh, they&#x27;re under the turnips. Sorry, Paula. My bad.  
But can you actually play &quot;idle games&quot; like this while getting your work day done? Aren&#x27;t they distracting and obstructive? These are important questions. I plan to find the answers by playing Rusty&#x27;s Retirement while simultaneously - and dutifully - completing days of work. Let&#x27;s go!

According to Bloomberg, these closures were just a part of a “widespread cost-cutting initiative” that’s still underway. All signs point towards more cuts to come, basically. ZeniMax studios seem to be the main target.

                              <span>Our players have played a lot of OpenTTD 14 since it was released a few weeks ago – in last week alone those who opted into our survey played 34,700 hours across 17,219 games. In all those hours, you’ve found some bugs, and we’ve done our best to fix them. The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multiplayer desync bug and cleans up a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
