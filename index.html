                    <span>With so many amazing indie titles released last year, you’d think it would be tough for 2022 to measure up. But somehow, this year is just as ridiculously stuffed with awesome-looking experiences. Independent creators are bringing their triple-I-games with titles that range from an action-packed Kung Fu epic to an unsettlingly cute community builder. Presented in chronological release order, here’s our list of the indie games we are most looking forward to in 2022.

Today history was made. Microsoft announced it&#x27;s purchasing Activision Blizzard for a reported $68.7 billion, and the face of the video game industry is entirely different. Join Alex Stadnik, John Carson, and Wes LeBlanc as they discuss the implications of this landmark deal and what it could mean for the future of video games.
It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture.

                    <span>Cuphead and his trusty drink-holding brother will hit Netflix next month. 
This news was announced today with the first official trailer for the series, which is called The Cuphead Show. This new trailer comes seven months after our first sneak peek at the show and as that peek indicated, The Cuphead Show will be about the titular character and his brother, Mugman, traversing the Inkwell Isles.

Unlike the game, which tasks players with wiping some debt owed to the Devil, it seems that the show is less about a central story such as that and more about episode-to-episode adventures that may or may not be hijacked by some devilish deeds from the Devil. However, the trailer reveals quite a few of the locales visited in Cuphead as well as many of the bosses…</span>

                    <span>The everchanging world of Fortnite received a significant update today. As the weather heats up and spring approaches, frozen sections of the game&#x27;s map are thawing. One such area has melted to reveal the return of Titled Towers, a popular location filled with towers that was a part of Fortnite&#x27;s first battle royale map.
The great thaw also has awakened new life in the form of giant dinosaurs called Klombos. These peaceful beasts are roughly the size of a bus and are roaming the world looking for things to eat, especially Klomberries. When they consume something, their color changes. You can interact with these beasts. Try running up a Klombos tail and see what happens when you reach the blowhole on its head. If you shoot a Klombo, it will attack you. That blowhole is also a weapon. So far, you can find two Klombos on the map – one to the northwest of the Daily Bugle and another to the west of Titled Towers.
In a few matches I played this morning, Titled Towers proved to be a popular destination with what seemed to be half of players descending upon it to see what has changed. You may want to arm yourself and shield up before landing at this fun spot. If you collect characters, you&#x27;ll find two have been added to the game in slots 21 and 22.
More significant changes will likely be on the way to Fortnite in a few weeks, as The Foundation and Haven Masks battle pass rewards unlock in 16 days. The item shop also updates daily at 6 p.m. CT. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Epic Games ties in any character skins and items with the return of Titled Towers. Maybe a Klombo trainer? We&#x27;ll find out later today.</span>

                    <span>Last October, Nintendo revealed that Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix would be heading to Switch. If you’ve been waiting with bated breath to enjoy Sora’s adventures on the go, mark February 10 as the date you’ll get to do so.
It’s important to emphasize that these are cloud versions, meaning you can only stream them over the internet. The games will not be available as traditional physical or digital releases. If you’re unsure if your internet connection is up to the task, free demos of each title are now available to test out. 
If this will be your first foray into the Kingdom Hearts series, figuring out the differences between these confusingly named collections can be headache-inducing. Below is a simple b…</span>

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups.

Nobody Saves the World is as charming and funny as Drinkbox Studios’ Guacamelee series. Bolstered by wonderfully challenging dungeons, Nobody’s core pillars of body swapping and ability customization go a long way to making this a memorable adventure, though a paper-thin world and underwhelming rewards keep this Nobody from being the best Somebody possible.
Within the amusing story, only one wizard has the power to shut down the disgusting fungal calamity that’s devastating the kingdom. Unfortunately, that guy is nowhere to be found. Instead, a pale, featureless wim…</span>

                    <span>Reaching for the sky.
Sonic Lost World was a rather interesting entry in the series, and pretty decent in this scribe&#x27;s humble opinion. It was exclusive to Wii U (with a 3DS version also released) until a little heralded PC port arrived, and of course that opened up the potential for mods; just last year we saw a fan recreation of the Yoshi DLC from the game.
That same creator, known as ĐeäTh on their YouTube channel, has now almost finished a mod to complete the PC version with The Legend of Zelda DLC. It was quite a big deal back in 2014 with the quirky free content referencing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. It had a wonky camera and was very short, but as a free addition to the game it was utterly charming and fun.

                    <span>2000 would have taken some beating.
The Pokémon Company enjoyed another cracking year in 2021 with plenty of new releases and success stories to write home about, including this latest little fact regarding physical sales.
The NPD Group&#x27;s Mat Piscatella has revealed that in 2021, dollar sales of Pokémon franchise physical software in the US reached the highest annual total since the year 2000. The success was down to last year&#x27;s launches of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and New Pokémon Snap, with continued sales of Pokémon Sword and Shield also doing the business.

The Artful Escape is a title that won plenty of critical acclaim last year when it arrived on PC and Xbox, and the very pleasing news is that it arrives on Switch next week - on 25th January.
As you can see in the trailer it&#x27;s a hugely colourful, dynamic game - you play as a folk singer with aspirations and a passion to be an epic rock star. The story that follows is bonkers, surreal and certainly full of surprises.

                    <span>The latest extraordinary power move by MS.
Microsoft caused a stir last year when it confirmed that its intended purchase of Zenimax had gone through, known better as the Bethesda deal. For over $7 billion Microsoft picked up Bethesda and a range of talented studios, with lots of discussion at the time over the impact of franchises like Fallout, Elder Scrolls and the upcoming Starfield being Xbox and PC exclusives. In what is increasingly becoming a very 2020s console war between MS and Sony it was a major blow, while from a Nintendo perspective it felt like another world, where two giants slugged it out as we enjoyed a bit of fun play on Switch.
Today&#x27;s news, that Microsoft has agreed a deal to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in cash, has caused an even bigger shock. The value of the deal is significant, as are the franchises and companies that could come under the company&#x27;s umbrella — Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Candy Crush and many more. We included the latter very deliberately — many of us would snort in derision at the mention of Candy Crush but, to be blunt, the value and revenues of Activision Blizzard&#x27;s mobile properties are also a significant part of the deal. People have also been bandying about the comparative &#x27;value&#x27; of Nintendo compared to that fee; the numbers being used are nonsense, but it shows how frazzled and befuddled this event has made onlookers.

Nintendo Switch was the best-selling games console of 2021 in the US, it&#x27;s been confirmed.
The news comes from The NPD Group&#x27;s Mat Piscatella, who has shared a thread of US sales stats covering the month of December. Piscatella notes that while the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 were &quot;effectively tied&quot; on dollar sales for the month, Switch was the best-seller in terms of units sold.

Announced just a couple of hours ago, the news has already led to much confusion and speculation amongst gaming fans. Is purchasing Activision, which is currently experiencing all sorts of deeply troubling issues of its own, really a wise move for Microsoft? And for almost $70 billion at that?

                    <span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe led Switch physical sales, of course.
Nintendo has been enjoying consistently strong sales results around the world, and one small example is the UK market. We have the benefit of regular data for UK game sales, and now GamesIndustry.biz has put together an interesting summary of results for 2021, which brings more positives around the Switch and its ongoing popularity.
The Switch was the UK&#x27;s best-selling console in 2021, an impressive achievement up against PS5 and the Xbox Series consoles. It passed PS5 in &#x27;the final weeks of the year&#x27;, with half a million systems sold in just November and December - with major game releases alongside the OLED model launch there&#x27;s little doubt that the Switch was a notable success in the lucrative Holidays shopping period.

                    <span>He&#x27;s got friends on the other side.
There&#x27;s no sense in pretending that Shadow Man isn&#x27;t a dated experience. But games like this — originally seen on PlayStation, N64, PC and Dreamcast — rather force a re-examination of the somewhat meaningless criticism &quot;dated&quot;. Seriously, what does it mean? A change in standards, perhaps. Differing expectations from a contemporary gaming experience. But, really, when a game like Shadow Man is re-released, is it fair to compare it to more slick, modern titles? Why should a re-release of an older title not reflect the time in which it was originally released? All of these are questions that Shadow Man Remastered can&#x27;t answer, obviously, but they&#x27;re worth keeping in mind.
Some will bounce straight off the game, obtuse as it can be. Your objectives are rarely clear in terms of a distinct A-to-B structure, there&#x27;s no map feature to speak of and you&#x27;ll find your hand quite resolutely unheld throughout. Taking control of Mike LeRoi (the titular Shadow Man) you&#x27;ll find your journey into Deadside is long, sprawling, difficult and intentionally confusing. The game in its original incarnation could be compared to the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but this remaster tweaks the inputs, loses the &quot;tank&quot; controls and ultimately feels a lot more like a traditional third-person shooter, albeit one with a lot more platforming and exploration than usual. Think Ratchet &amp; Clank, but vastly more challenging.

Microsoft has purchased embattled Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot publisher Activision in a deal worth a whopping $68.7 billion.
To give some perspective on the astonishing size of that figure, Disney paid $4.05 billion for Star Wars studio Lucasfilm in 2012, with half of the money paid in cash and the other half in Disney stock. A more interesting comparison is that Nintendo&#x27;s net worth as of January 17th, 2022 is $59.39 billion.

                    <span>The PC version of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox now supports cooperative multiplayer, a tidy little post-launch bonus for Nihon Falcom&#x27;s action-RPG. Nadia Oxford told us last year that for fans of the genre, &quot;the Ys series is a must-play, and Ys IX is as good a place to start as any.&quot; Co-op makes it an even nicer place to start because friends are nice, aren&#x27;t they?

                    <span>I used to think that big, intricate character customisation systems were pretty much mandatory for decent CRPGs. As I saw it, the ability to conjure up a hideous goblin man with a chin curving back up into his face, if you wanted to, was a sign that you were playing something in the big leagues. Now, however, I am not so sure.  

Expeditions: Rome, a historical CRPG blending turn-based combat, strategic army management, and lots of dialogue, has a pretty rubbish character creation system. There’s bugger all you can really do to customise your Roman. and after the mammoth character forge of Pathfinder: Wrath Of The Righteous, for example, it all just feels very sparse and shoestringy. And that is a damned shame, because when it gets down to business, this is a seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times.

Wait, hang on. What. That&#x27;s not what I expected when Xbox head Phil Spencer told staff he was &quot;evaluating all aspects of [Xbox&#x27;s] relationship&quot; with Activision Blizzard. Microsoft plan to pay $68.7 billion (£50 billion) for the company, which will nab them games including Warcraft, Call Of Duty, and Overwatch. Jesus.

                    <span>To perform an ollie is to commune with gods. Or maybe just look cool. OlliOlli World is shaping up to be a good-spirited renovation of the 2D skateboarding series that has traditionally been quite punishing. This one&#x27;s got a flashy third dimension, moon-faced cartoon characters, and a plucky story to match. We&#x27;re told of Skate Godz who once appointed a human representative on earth. But she&#x27;s about to retire and needs a prodigy to step forward to fill her Vans. The player is that potential new conduit between holy half-pipers and humanity. In other words, this is a quest to become Skate Pope. Caliph of kickflips. Dalai Slama. Having both popped and shoved-it through a heap of levels in preview, I&#x27;m happy to report you can all sit down. I&#x27;m the chosen one. It&#x27;s me.

                    <span>A group of Foxhole players are going on strike to pressure the developers into address issues they feel ruin their chosen role in the war, logistics. The World War 2 sandbox MMO is a persistent battle where weapons, vehicle, and building rely on resources gathered, processed, and delivered by other players, without whom the war machine slows down. Our boy Brendy called logistics &quot;the real heroes&quot; when he rode with them a few years back. But many are unhappy with the current state of their role, so they&#x27;ve formed a union.

                    <span>Something is missing from Nobody Saves The World, a new action RPG from Guacamelee devs DrinkBox Studios. This is a dungeon-crawler that lets you shapeshift into horses, bodybuilders, and ghosts in your bid to save the world, but it&#x27;s a quest blighted not only by a Calamity, but by repetition too. Charming characters and clever mighty-morphin&#x27; combat succumb to numbers, which reduces what could&#x27;ve been a rich world to a rather hollow dash between dungeons.

                    <span>Can I get a ‘woop woop’, or at least a ‘wololo’, for the spin-off strategy game? The Ensemble Studios swansong that was Halo Wars, an RTS so streamlined it was aerodynamic. The ballistic ballet of Gears Tactics, which piled extra biceps atop XCOM’s shoulders. Even when money has moved through the membrane in the opposite direction, it has resulted in projects that were - let’s not overstate this - endearingly experimental. Can I get an understanding nod for Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade?
The strangeness of Crossfire: Legion’s situation is that you might not recognise it as a spin-off at all. That’s because the series is a big old blind spot for the Western world. Crossfire is an enormously successful Korean FPS that bears more than a passing resemblance to Counter-Strike - all right angles, assault weapons, and de_dust2 - but dwarfs even Steam’s most popular game for player numbers. With 690 million participants across 80 countries, it’s the biggest online FPS in the world. In China, where the game is a major cultural force, a coming-of-age television drama about two young Crossfire players has been watched 1.8 billion times. Bridger-what? Geralt of Where? The upshot of all that success is that Crossfire radiates money, and some of it is now funding new games from prestigious Western developers. Remedy is working on a campaign FPS in the classic COD style. And Blackbird Interactive is building an RTS named Legion.

It turns out I&#x27;m not alone. App developer Steven Cravotta explained on Twitter that a completely unrelated game he released five years ago, also called Wordle, has had a major increase in downloads over the past few weeks. And now he&#x27;s donating the money he&#x27;s made to charity.

                    <span>Blue Isle Studios is bringing its new shooter, Leap, to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 along with a PC release. Check out the trailer below showing its wild, fast-paced action ... in action.

Leap features 60-player matches where players take on roles determined by which exosuit they choose to utilize. The four currently available are the Pathfinder, Titan, Wraith, and Tech Ops, each with different playstyles, armor types, and skills. Some let you fly in the air with a jetpack, while others let you stealth or play the support role. Personal vehicles or PVs let players mount up on their preferred ride, including a mechanical moose, what looks like a snow tube, or my favorite: the hoverboard. I definitely prefer cruising into battle like a gun-toating Silver Surfer.
Check out the Leap site to sign up for a chance to play in its beta which begins on January 19.</span>

Those out there who are looking for a reason to buy and play Ys IX: Monstrum Nox have a few new features to look forward to when you finally pull the trigger. Seriously, though. Play Ys VIII and IX!
Coming in a major update to the Steam version of the game is local co-op. In the trailer above you can see the feature in action, which lets a second player take control of someone as long as multiple playable characters are present in the scene. In the Steam post announcing the update, it talks about the changes from co-op in the previous Ys title, saying, &quot;the second player is largely equivalent to the primary player in terms of capabilities in Ys IX, including movement and combat abilities, using Monstrum Gifts, discovering and triggering landmarks, enemies and events, opening chests, picking up collectibles, and initiating dialogue. Only interacting with menus and the map is restricted to player one.&quot; Pretty impressive for shoehorning multiplayer into a decidedly single-player experience.
Also joining the game is 16:10 support, which allows for slightly narrower displays to be supported. One of those displays sporting that aspect ratio is the upcoming Steam Deck handheld device, which the developers luckily had on hand to snap a picture of the game running on it. 
Topping off the update are some bug fixes to clean up some issues from launch. You can check out the full developer post right here. 
Have you played Ys IX and does multiplayer sound like a way you&#x27;d want to play it? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Deck builders are played with cards, but all too often, they’re lumped into core card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra, Yu-Gi-Oh!, or others. While certainly there are some awesome competitive tabletop deck builders to check out (Dominion rules, folks), in games today they’re often roguelike dungeon crawls, allowing players to unlock new options, distill their decks down to only the best cards, and try out a wealth of strategies. In fact, you don’t have to like card games at all to enjoy a good deck builder, as they’re more akin to a mechanics-focused turn-based RPG in style and spirit. Anyway, do yourself a favor and check out one of these titles for a great look at what the genre has to offer.

While the internet may be more familiar with fantasy sports such as football or baseball, that doesn&#x27;t mean the gamers of the world can&#x27;t have a little fun too. From God of War to Red Dead Redemption II and everything in between, join Game Informer as we pick the best games of 2018 and form the ultimate fantasy teams.
But how does the process work? The panel of Ben Reeves, John Carson, Kim Wallace, Alex Stadnik, and Alex Van Aken have assembled to select five games apiece from 2018 to create the most robust roster possible. After randomizing the draft order, each person will have time to decide. At the end of the round, the order reverses, and the fun continues from the fifth person back to the first.
Sounds pretty standard, right? You can fill your list with as many great games as possible and create the video game equivalent of the 1990s Chicago Bulls. That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong. If you&#x27;ve played fantasy sports before, you&#x27;re well aware that picking players in the late rounds can get rough. In that spirit, each panel member in today&#x27;s video must select one title off Metacritic&#x27;s list of the worst games of 2018. In a year of such high highs, it&#x27;s incredible how low the lows can get.
But why are we drafting games like this? Just for fun? Why no, for the community validation, of course! That&#x27;s right, folks. You get to vote on who has the strongest list. Be sure to head over to our Discord to select the editor with the strongest list, and we&#x27;ll read the results on this week&#x27;s episode of The GI Show! Thank you so much for your participation and please let us know what you thought of the segment in the comments below!</span>

While fans were hopeful about Halo Infinite, not many could have predicted the dominant return Master Chief would make at the end of 2021. The multiplayer suite blew players away with a joyous amalgamation of pitch-perfect combat and some of the best multiplayer maps the series had seen in a long time. The campaign refocused in scale and featured some of the most emotional character moments we’ve seen from Master Chief and Cortana. Not only that, but 343 Industries opened Zeta Halo to players in ways unheard of in a Halo game, creating a delightful semi-open-world experience that features some of the greatest movement the series has ever seen.
But it wasn’t all perfect. Multiplayer staples such as Slayer and Free For All weren’t included at launch. Forge an…</span>

                    <span>Changes are coming to Halo Infinite&#x27;s store starting this week, according to a series of tweets from Jerry Hook, the head of design at 343 Industries. 
Users have had concerns about the pricing in Infinite&#x27;s shop since it launched in late November, and it looks like this week will finally see a change in course for what is offered and for how much. Jerry Hook starts his mini-thread announcing the impending update, saying, &quot;We’ve been monitoring the discussions on the Shop, bundles, and pricing closely since launch. Using data and community feedback, we’re going to begin rolling out changes to how we package and price items in Halo Infinite – and it all starts next week.&quot; His thread continues, &quot;Starting Tuesday, the Shop experience will vary week-to-week. We are focused on reducing pricing across the board, providing stronger values in our bundles, starting to put individual items outside of bundles, and more.&quot;

January 15, 2022
With the week-to-week adjustments being made, it seems like the in-game store will be evolving and changing based on trends over the coming months. Hook speaks to that in his third tweet, saying, &quot;We will be trying new things throughout the rest of the season so that we can continue to learn and improve for the future. Please keep the feedback coming during this process and I hope to see you all next week for the Cyber Showdown event!&quot; 
What the changes are, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully you can get your Spartan Cat ears or space pickle charms on the cheap going forward. If there are any interesting developments in the Halo Infinite shop, we have a story that we keep updated just about every week to reflect the deals on offer. Check there tomorrow afternoon to see if anything substantial has taken place.</span>

                    <span>When titles like The Secret of Monkey Island became rarer, so too did Jamie Ottilie’s time with the adventure genre, and, like many, he moved on to other increasingly popular types of games. But then, Telltale Games was formed – roughly a decade after the golden age of adventure games – built from the ashes of LucasArts by a number of former employees, piquing Ottilie’s interest immediately.
Ottilie enjoyed the studio’s first handful of games, but his interest reached new heights following the first season of Telltale’s The Walking Dead, the game that most agree put the studio on the map. And from there, the Telltale of old was born – a studio seemingly destined to create excellent stories in pre-existing universes such as The Walking Dead, and later Game of Thrones and Batman.

                    <span>Ubisoft isn&#x27;t the only publisher with its hands on the Avatar franchise. This weekend, Disney and Tencent unveiled plans to release Avatar: Reckoning, an MMO role-playing shooter slated for iOS and Android. Development duties are for Reckoning are being handled by Archosaur Games.
The press release announcing the title gives us some info on what to expect. &quot;Avatar: Reckoning will transport players to never-before-seen parts of Pandora where they will meet new Na’vi clans fighting to defend their home, battle powerful RDA troops seeking to exploit the resources of the moon, and encounter spectacular alien creatures.&quot; Players will be able to take on challenges solo, co-op, or in &quot;dynamic multiplayer matches.&quot; You&#x27;ll level up and equip your Na&#x27;vi with weaponry throughout the story mode experience.
Avatar: Reckoning is being developed on Unreal Engine 4 and is set to release sometime this year.
The other adventure taking place on James Cameron&#x27;s Pandora is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, developed by Ubisoft&#x27;s Massive Entertainment. Using the Snowdrop Engine that powers The Division 2, its debut trailer from last summer is a stunner. Go check out that footage to see how Ubi is translating the film franchise onto consoles and PC.</span>

                    <span>Never judge a book by its cover. That’s a great lesson in general, especially for video games, but even more so for a select batch of games that are far more than they appear on the surface. While many games feature narrative and mechanical twists, these particular titles go the extra mile to hide their true natures, intentionally so, to surprise players. 
I love games that subvert expectations like this, but they can be hard to seek out or suggest to others. For one, they may initially appear out of your wheelhouse. If you don’t play visual novels, then Doki Doki Literature Club, for example, may pass you by even if the things it’s really going for would be up your alley.

🏁TIME 🏁
#AGDQ2022 has raised a total amount of $3,416,729 for @preventcancer! This is officially the most we&#x27;ve ever raised in the history of @GamesDoneQuick - ANOTHER WR🏆
January 16, 2022
Taking the top spot in donation totals for any Games Done Quick event, at the time of the marathon ended the grand donation sum clocked in at $3,416,729 with even more money sent in after the fact. The prior record sat around $3.1 million, with the new total handily surpassing that number.
Awesome Games Done Quick and its aptly-named summer event sibling Summer Games Done Quick are week-long stream marathons where speedrunners show off their quickest times to complete games and collect funds for a deserving charity. This year&#x27;s AGDQ featured some very fun exhibitions of games like Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, a blindfolded run of Sekiro, Eternal Darkness (played for the first time at AGDQ), and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. Capping off the show was a 1 hour 21 minute &quot;All Bosses&quot; playthrough of Metal Gear Solid. Check out any of the runs from this past week at the Games Done Quick YouTube page.
Congratulations to the Prevent Cancer Foundation, the staff of Games Done Quick and runners involved in ADGQ, and those who donated for a great cause. If you&#x27;re interested in bolstering the donation total even more, it looks like the AGDQ page is still accepting submissions.</span>

Turtle Rock Studios helped define the cooperative squad-based genre with Left 4 Dead and its recently released spiritual successor, Back 4 Blood. 10 Chamber Collective, a small group of ex-Payday developers, was undoubtedly inspired by the acclaimed zombie-slaying franchise. In truth, the studio’s debut project, GTFO, is Payday meets Left 4 Dead, but with a deliciously dangerous learning curve. GTFO’s satisfying mix of tactical action and all-encompassing uneasiness will likely appeal to FPS fanatics yearning for an electrifying challenge. And now that its two-year Early Access period has ended, 10 Chamber Collective’s survival…</span>

                    <span>Mario Kart is a fantastic franchise – one of Nintendo’s best, easily – but it’s time for it to come to an end. Now, that’s a bit of a loaded phrase, but I wholeheartedly mean it: we don’t need another Mario Kart game. What we do need, however, is a brand new exciting kart game from Nintendo. It should feature not just Mario (can’t leave behind the Kart King like that) and the gang, but Link, Zelda, and other Hyrulian characters, too. We should still be able to race with the Inklings from Splatoon, but if I want, let me race as Protagonist from Astral Chain or even Lappy. 
What I’m proposing is the end of Mario Kart and the beginning of Nintendo Kart.

We love it when people show off their creativity in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, especially when it involves the ingenious use of underappreciated things like the polish effects and emotes. This latest ACNH creation comes courtesy of Th3Meow, who has recreated a few iconic scenes from Disney&#x27;s newest animated movie, Encanto.
Accompanied by Animal Crossing-style piano covers of some of the tracks from Encanto, the video shows Mirabel introducing the Madrigal family — Julieta and Agustín, Dolores, Luisa, Camilo, Isabela, Pepa and Félix, Antonio, and even family outcast Bruno... who is shown with his rat friends.

                    <span>Round? Sleepy? Same.
Pokémon Kids TV is an incredible source of extremely cute animation, with surprisingly high production value, too. There&#x27;s this gorgeous one about Nidoran, and a Ghibli-esque one starring Slugma, everyone&#x27;s favourite lava slug.
The newest one on the Pokémon Kids TV channel is a claymation-style one — like the Hisuian Voltorb video we loved so much — but this time it&#x27;s about one sleepy little Rowlet who&#x27;s bothering a Ditto (by accident).

Another year, another third Monday in January. We&#x27;ve updated this feel-good game list with a handful of new additions to help you feel-even-gooder as we head into the uncharted waters of 2022...

Blue Monday. No, not just a kick-ass New Order song, but the name coined by marketers for the third Monday in January — purportedly the &#x27;most depressing day of the year&#x27;. While the genesis and questionable &#x27;science&#x27; behind this dreary moniker is smirk-worthy, looking after your mental health is something everyone should take seriously, especially after the emotional drubbing so many of us have taken recently.

Seemingly thousands of enemies on screen, and the physics to simulate them being hurled about.

You can watch said trailer below, released alongside the news that the game has slipped into next month.

Or is this the one where we&#x27;ve had a while to realise that the promise of hope in the new year is, once again, a terrible lie? Perhaps. Either way, I refuse to submit. Enjoy the heck out of this Monday. Have your favourite thing for dinner. Watch your favourite movie. Have a bath and put on a cool playlist of songs and sing really loud to annoy your neighbour.
Alternatively, play some cool video games! Here are the ones that make me smile when I&#x27;m feeling blue.

It’s essentially an AI-fuelled upgrade to Nvidia’s DSR downsampling tool, aiming to more intelligently render the frames of your games so that they appear more detailed – without the same performance loss that comes with standard DSR. It’s an intriguing new feature that could make some of the best graphics cards even better, and I’ve been trying it out to see if it performs as effectively as Nvidia claims.

On one hand, thank god it was only £119,000 because if it was the millions that some ugly Twitter avatars have sold for, every other mercenary games company would ramp up their own NFT initiatives. On the other, oh god £119,000 is still so much money for basically nothing.

                    <span>The speedrunning fundraiser festival Awesome Games Done Quick ended in the wee hours on Sunday, with one of its most spectacular runs coming in the final stretch. A speedrunner beat Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in just over two hours, which frankly is impressive enough to me. More than that, the runner known as &quot;Mitchriz&quot; was blindfolded from start to finish, guided by a combination of memory and feeling-out environments. In two hours! Ludicrious.

                    <span>I enjoy the sub-genre of meme about Sad Murder Dads as much as the next gal. Heck, I enjoy those lads themselves. From Kratos in God Of War, to Joel in The Last Of Us, and even less story-focused murder dads like Soldier 76, dudes rock. Successfully rehabilitated and reimagined as father figures struggling to inhabit that role and accept their emotions, in some very good games to boot. Developers who were hot young guns in the 00s are now tired middle-aged dads themselves, and as a result the art they consume and, more to the point, the art they want to make looks radically different. I&#x27;m not having a go at that; that&#x27;s just life, is what that is.
But what I&#x27;m asking is, what&#x27;s the mum equivalent? Because I really want to see someone give a mum story the same big budget, fun epic treatment that Kratos got in God Of War. At the same time, I also dread this coming to pass.

                    <span>Friday&#x27;s long-awaited PC launch of God Of War was mostly received by people nodding their heads and muttering &quot;Boy&quot;—the highest praise a heavy heart can offer. A few would-be players, however, found themselves unable to play, with the game throwing up &quot;out of memory&quot; error messages when they really shouldn&#x27;t be out of memory. The devs have been looking into the issue, and released a potential fix on an opt-in experimental branch on Steam. It sounds like it fixes the problem for some people, but not all.

                    <span>Milan Brož, správce cryptsetup, objevil zranitelnost CVE-2021–4122 v LUKS 2.2.0 a novějších. Jde o zneužití reencryption, tedy přešifrování za běhu. Útočník s přístupem k disku a bez znalosti hesla může pozměnit metadata LUKS2, aby to vypadalo, že reencryption bylo v průběhu přerušeno. Zařízení se bude tvářit normálně a po zadání platného hesla skutečným uživatelem se zařízení bez varování rozšifruje. Změna bude vidět pouze v luksDump.</span>

                    <span>After tackling Metroid in Season 1, the second season of Game Informer&#x27;s Video Gameography podcast moves on to one of the biggest shooter franchises in existence: Halo. This week, we examine Bungie&#x27;s swansong for the Halo franchise: Halo Reach.
Halo Reach launched on September 14, 2010, for Xbox 360 and served as a prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved. Set on the doomed planet Reach, players control a new member of the Spartan Noble Team as they valiantly defend the human-occupied world from a massive Covenant invasion. The time and setting gave Bungie creative freedom to introduce new characters and flesh out an event that had only been referenced in books, while the multiplayer introduced new (though divisive) mechanics such as armor abilities. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves) and Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Polygon&#x27;s Mike Mahardy (@mmahardy) as we unpack the history and impact of Halo&#x27;s most emotionally charged entry to that point. And for more Halo, be sure to check out our definitive ranking of every Halo game.

                    <span>Last November, Q-Games announced that its shuttered collaborative multiplayer game The Tomorrow Children would be rising from the grave. We still don&#x27;t know when players will be able to resume building islands as unsettling doll-like characters, but players have a chance to contribute something new to the experience thanks to a new contest.
Q-Games&#x27; contest invites players to design an island of their own from scratch. You see, The Tomorrow Children is all about working alongside players to rebuild the world, known as The Void, after a neo-Soviet experiment goes awry. Landmasses take the form of islands and, to promote the game&#x27;s spirit of contribution, one of these could be custom-made by you. 
No game development experience is necessary. If you have the imagination and some decent artistic chops, you&#x27;re as qualified as any other entrant. Your concept can be a drawing, a 3D model, or whatever visual representation you prefer. There are some rules to note, which you can read in full here. The major stipulations are that the winners won&#x27;t be paid for this, and they&#x27;ll surrender claims to any intellectual rights their creation. Winners will be included in the game&#x27;s credits, however. It probably goes without saying that designs featuring plagiarized elements or are overtly violent and/or sexual will be disqualified.
You can submit entries beginning today by visiting the contest&#x27;s website. Submissions close on February 1, and Q-Games will announce the winners on July 15. Given that timeframe, it&#x27;s likely The Tomorrow Children won&#x27;t be relaunching during the first half of the year. We&#x27;ll have to see if it makes it out again before the end of 2022 and if it will remain a PlayStation exclusive now that Q-Games has regained the rights. 
What do you think of this contest? Are you interested in entering? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Last month, due to the overwhelming queue times to access Final Fantasy XIV servers, digital game sales and certain services were suspended until things calmed down. Now, Square Enix is preparing to allow fresh accounts to be created in a couple of weeks.
According to a developer blog post, January 25 will be the date digital sales of Final Fantasy XIV will be resumed. The move coincides with the already-planned opening of a new Oceanian data center, bringing five new worlds into existence, hopefully alleviating congestion on other worlds. This also means the suspended Home World Transfer Service will also be brought back on January 25, letting players bring their character to these new servers, or elsewhere barring any limitations imposed on still-overpopulated worlds.

                    <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas.

Fallen Order was released November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Daniel Tack, Andrew Reiner, along with TikTok and Twitch star Louie Benson (@TeamLouie) on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure.

                    <span>In what feels like a rare positive update regarding supply in the tech sector, Valve has announced its delivery estimations of the Steam Deck are currently on track. The update, which was posted on the Steam Community site, gives the good news that the first batch of handheld PCs will ship in late February.
By now, we&#x27;re all well versed in supply chain issues, challenges presented by working remotely during the pandemic, and chip shortages, some of which did delay the Steam Deck once from its original launch window. Valve says that&#x27;s not going to be the case again, at least for the first batch of devices, saying, &quot;it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February.&quot; If you happen to have a preorder down on a Deck, you can check your personal delivery date on the Steam Deck store page here.
Work on identifying which games will work best on the Steam Deck is also well underway. The blog post says, &quot;In parallel, work and testing for the Steam Deck Verified program has been underway. You’ll soon be able to see Deck Verified status for a growing set of Steam games. We’re checking four major categories: input, seamlessness, display, and system support.&quot; Knowing which games will work on your shiny new hardware will be invaluable, especially for early adopters testing the limits of their Steam library, so it&#x27;s nice to see this filtering feature isn&#x27;t a post-launch afterthought.
If you&#x27;re curious what the Steam Deck is, we have you covered! Check out this quick rundown of the specs announced for Valve&#x27;s upcoming portable device.</span>

                    <span>The reveal of Dune: Spice Wars was an unexpected treat during The Game Awards 2021. The upcoming game reunites the long-running (and newly relevant) sci-fi property with the genre it helped popularize: 4x strategy. Fans have patiently waited for more details about the game and got their wish thanks to a developer FAQ on the game’s Steam page.
Developer Shiro Games answered some common questions about the title. It clarifies that Spice Wars is a combination of 4x and real-time strategy elements that includes, among other things, base-building. The game has been developed from the ground up, meaning it won’t feature any elements from Shiro’s previous strategy game, Northgard. Maps will also be procedurally generated and sport a variety of unique traits players can tinker with. 
Shiro Games previously announced two playable factions: House Harkonnen and House Atreides. It plans to have two more factions at launch and a 5th house during Early Access. Shiro wants to remain faithful to the book series first and foremost, stating that houses that appeared in prior Dune games but not in the source materials, such as House Ordos, aren’t guaranteed to return in Spice Wars.

Other nuggets include confirmation of multiplayer and plans to add a campaign at some point in Early Access. Shiro is also open to the idea of adding mod support depending on the level of demand. 
Dune: Spice Wars is slated to launch in PC Early Access sometime this year, but Shiro will be eyeing other platforms after launch, so don’t rule out an eventual console release.
Be sure to visit the full FAQ to see if your burning questions have been addressed. If they haven’t, don’t despair. Shiro Plans to provide additional gameplay updates throughout the coming months.</span>

In gruff moments of fatherly instruction, Kratos repeats the phrase “be better” to his son, Atreus. This happens in different contexts, but the lesson remains consistent: Your decisions are not bound by precedent, and the choices of others are not examples to follow – they only set standards you can strive to exceed. In developing the latest God of War, Sony’s Santa Monica studio apparently took this message to heart. While previous games in this series es…</span>

                    <span>Popularity, I have learned from American teen television shows, isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. While Square Enix haven&#x27;t been bombed by the local mafioso, joined a murderous D&amp;D cult, or discovered their dad is a serial killer and they too have the serial killer genes (thanks, Riverdale!), they did find such overwhelming success with Final Fantasy XIV that they temporarily stopped selling the MMORPG. They couldn&#x27;t expand servers quickly enough to meet demand, see, leading to login queues and frustration. But now things are settling enough to to start selling it again, and they have big plans to expand servers.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not sure I trust the Page of Cups. As imagined by Pamela Colman Smith and A.E. Waite in the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot, he&#x27;s a cocky young man in a floral tunic, standing by the seashore hefting a goblet. There&#x27;s a fish peeking out of the goblet and the Page appears to be gossiping with it, perhaps sharing a joke about the artist, because honestly, what kind of artist paints a guy talking to fish. Or is he thinking about offering us the cup? The set of his jaw is ambiguous.
When drawn in an upright position, the Page suggests a flash of inspiration reeled from the mind&#x27;s ocean, or a dazzling opportunity. In this guise, he&#x27;s been a good friend to Ami Y. Cai, a game creator and illustrator from Kentucky - though in her first Tarot deck, Stephanie Pui-Mun Law&#x27;s Shadowscapes Tarot, the symbolism has been flipped around a little, the Page depicted as a mermaid peering into a steaming bowl. “Sometimes sparks come to me through conversations, or while I&#x27;m doing something else,” Cai tells me over Zoom. “So when I see the Page of Cups, I know that a creative opportunity is coming my way.”

                    <span>Puzzle games don&#x27;t need a plot, or even a theme or setting. When very abstracted ones throw one in it&#x27;s often an indulgence, or just an excuse to hang the aesthetics around something the devs happen to like. Blink Planets seemed like this at first, and that was fine! A little sexy hexy is all you really need if it&#x27;s done right, after all. I cannot believe I just said that.


Partway through though, I realised Blink Planets isn&#x27;t just about connecting things with lines of tiles. It really is about the urban planning its setting suggests.

                    <span>Earlier this week, Nvidia quietly announced a kind of DLSS-adjacent downsampling tech: Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR). It aims to improve image sharpness and quality on GeForce RTX graphics cards, using AI to reduce the performance loss of Nvidia’s existing DSR feature, and it’s now available to install and enable through GeForce Game Ready Driver 511.23.

                    <span>Over the holidays, I decided to treat myself to the gift of funk, and bought myself a neat little acoustic bass. The guitar arrived as promised; I am still waiting on the funk. Any day now. In the meantime, I’ve taught myself the riff for Valley Of The Fallen Star, better known as the Cosmo Canyon theme from Final Fantasy VII. I’m not sure if I can adequately put into words how the original composition of the track makes me feel, but I am certain I’m not the only one.It is sonic nostalgia for a simpler time, where following a talking dog’s weeble uncle to the projection of the cosmos he kept in his loft did nothing to shatter my emotional investment in a story.

                    <span>With each of us being little more than a kilogram of meaty slop and a stringy nervous system which would fall vaguely into the shape of a human if slapped out on a table or hung from a doorframe, it&#x27;s fascinating to see how other people interpret the world and its complexities. So hey, look, here&#x27;s Democracy 4, the latest in the government simulator series from Positech Games. After 15 months in early access, it&#x27;s now out in full: a detailed model of how Positech think politics works, for you to try to gain and keep power.

                    <span>Fear not the fate of the Steam Deck, Valve’s ambitious, SteamOS-based handheld gaming PC. While the Deck’s release date was originally planned for sometime in December 2021, a Steam Community update from Valve has assured that they’re on track for the rescheduled launch next month.


“First and foremost, we’re on track to ship Steam Deck on time. Global pandemic, supply issues, and shipping issues notwithstanding, it looks like we&#x27;ll be able to start getting these out the door by the end of February”, so says the post.

PlayStation invites you to take a lap around the Daytona International Speedway in this new in-game footage of Gran Turismo 7.
Polyphony Digital is a master of details, and this sub-four-minute clip is full of them. Starting out in a first-person driver view, we take in the little odds and ends around the dash of the vehicle, including the actively-updating stats on the steering wheel display. The shadows and light, both direct and bounce lighting, are on full display in this view as well, not to mention the materials and textures of objects like the driver&#x27;s gloves and the various metals and plastics in view.
Pulling out to camera shots outside of the car, we see the models of the vehicles themselves and how they move and interact with the road they&#x27;re peeling across. The subtle weight shifts are noticeable if you watch the body of the cars closely as they turn, speed up, or hit the breaks. We also get a great look at the reflections on the windshields and side windows, and light reflections and flares off of shinier materials on the vehicles. Other details to look out for are the crowd density in the stands and the overcast skies. 
Sony&#x27;s newest entry in its impeccably detailed driving simulator hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on March 4.
How&#x27;s Gran Turismo 7 looking to you? How do you think it stacks up to other recent racers we&#x27;ve seen in the past couple of years? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>The 25th annual DICE Awards takes place next month and will honor the best and brightest titles to release in 2021. Unlike The Game Awards, which is a bit more mainstream and consists of votes from both media and the general public, the DICE Awards (which stands for Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) is helmed by The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. It&#x27;s also an industry-only event generally viewed as the most prestigious award ceremony in the business. Today, we found out this year’s event honors 59 nominated titles across 23 categories. 
Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart leads the pack in terms of the number of nominations with nine. Deathloop doesn’t lag far behind, garnering eight nominations. Academy members, which consists of a jury of industry peers, begin voting today. IGN …</span>

Chorus is a madcap barrage of laser beams, missiles, and impossible space combat dodges, boosts, and chases in its best moments. At its worst, it’s bogged down with tiresome and repetitive encounters, frustrating checkpoints, and bland characters. Sci-fi space combat shooters are a niche genre today, so while I’m thankful Chorus exists, much of the game is a relatively linear and mundane slog, punctuated by a few epic encounters here and there that live up to a galactic fantasy.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is just a few weeks away, and Techland is wrapping up its Dying 2 Know video series with Episode 6 today.
Like all previous episodes of Dying 2 Know, there&#x27;s a thing or two worth watching for. This time, Techland answers a frequently asked question with a little show and tell. Yes, there certainly is co-op play in the open world sequel, and it supports up to four players running around The City. Check out the video above to see footage of multiplayer in action.
Another big focus of Episode 6 is showing footage from the various platforms Dying Light 2 will be available on. Back in December, our own Senior Editor Brian Shea experienced this first hand, playing a portion of the game on PlayStation 4 Pro. Check out his hands-on impressions right here, where he was generally impressed with how it ran on older hardware.
Also in this episode, you&#x27;ll hear from the developers about working on the game over the last few years and, as always, there&#x27;s plenty of gameplay footage to check out.
Dying Light 2 Stay Human will be available on February 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch (Cloud), and PC. Apparently, the game is stuffed to the gills with 500 hours of gameplay, though that number has changed a few times this week. Regardless, check out our comparison to other games with long run times.</span>

                    <span>Microsoft has revealed that it is no longer producing new Xbox One consoles. 
That includes the original Xbox One console, Xbox One S (and its All-Digital edition), and Xbox One X. This isn’t anything new for the tech giant, though – it actually stopped manufacturing the Xbox One X and Xbox One S All-Digital edition in July of 2020. However, the Xbox One generation is officially done now that The Verge has learned that Microsoft stopped making Xbox One S consoles, the last of that generation still being manufactured, at the end of 2020. 
“To focus on the production of the Xbox Series X/S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,” senior director of Xbox console product marketing, Cindy Walker, told The Verge. 
This news comes just a day after a new Bloomberg write-up revealed that Sony is reportedly doing the exact opposite with its PlayStation 4 console, ramping up production of another 1 million units in 2022 to address the ongoing PlayStation 5 shortage. 
Of course, Microsoft’s news today doesn’t mean finding an Xbox One or one of its many variants will be impossible as there are still plenty out there on shelves. However, with news that these consoles are no longer being produced, we wouldn’t surprised if they started flying off the shelves as that’s what typically happens when the collector market hears of production on something ending. For example, try finding a Nintendo 3DS available to purchase at MSRP today – good luck. 
It’s not surprising that Microsoft is honing in its focus on its new-gen of consoles – the Xbox Series X and Series S – especially in light of industry reports that reveal the ongoing chip shortage that makes buying new-gen consoles so difficult at the moment could last until 2023.

                    <span>God of War was one of the best games released in 2018, and it will probably be one of the best games to release in 2022 because it’s now coming to PC. To find out what made that game great in the first place, be sure to read our original review. To learn what the developers think of playing the game with the mouse and keyboard or why they might not offer mod support, we spoke to Sony Santa Monica’s creative director Cory Barlog and senior manager of technical production Matt DeWald.
Let’s cut to the chase. Why do you think people should check God of War out now that it’s on PC? 
Matt DeWald: We’ve sold almost 20 million, like 19.5 million copies on console, but it’s surprising to hear that there are still people out there that have never played it. And if they haven’t played it on console …</span>

                    <span>IO Interactive revealed its Year 2 plans for Hitman 3, which also came with the news that the entire Hitman World of Assassination Trilogy would be coming to Xbox Game Pass. The studio also revealed that Hitman VR support, which works for all three Hitman games, will come to PC. 
Year 2 of Hitman 3 starts this month with the Elusive Target Arcade, which goes live on January 20. This is a new game mode that takes the Elusive Target concept featured in this trilogy to “the next level” as it “mixes up the formula and introduces new challenges and unlockable rewards, all whilst keeping the essence of what makes Elusive Targets exciting and interesting to play.”

                    <span>Shadow Man Remastered is a, well, remastered re-release of the 1999 cult game that launched on PC last April. The updated version comes from Nightdive Studios, the team currently handling the upcoming System Shock remake, and it&#x27;s making its surprise jump to consoles...today!
Shadow Man was developed by Acclaim and launched on August 31, 1999, for PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC before coming to the Sega Dreamcast later that same year. Players control the titular Shadowman, a superhero by Valiant Comics whose series first began in the early ‘90s. In addition to possessing enhanced strength, agility, and durability, Shadowman sports occult powers born from voodoo, which you&#x27;ll use to battle otherworldly foes to prevent an apocalypse. The game was a modest critical success and went to garner a cult following. You can watch the remaster’s launch trailer below.

The remaster features 4K visuals and 60 frames-per-second gameplay, with other graphical flourishes such as anti-aliasing and dynamic shadow mapping. Controls have also been modernized with mechanics such as a weapon wheel and auto-targeting. The Switch version, which launches January 17, includes gyro-aiming. For existing fans, the remaster also includes three new levels that were cut from the original release. 
You can pick up Shadow Man Remastered digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One now for $19.99.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have released a new gameplay preview trailer for Pokémon Legends: Arceus and it’s a 13-minute look at what we’ll actually be doing in the game when it launches on January 28. 
It offers the best look yet at this new take on the Pokémon formula, which is especially exciting because as of late, Nintendo has been churning out trailer after trailer showcasing essentially the same content. Not to mention, no official public hands-on previews have happened for this game so we don’t even know what playing Arceus feels like. However, today’s gameplay preview video provides some answers to a lot of the questions we had.

                    <span>Xbox announced back in December that starting that month, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would be getting monthly multiplayer bonuses in Halo Infinite. In December, subscribers received a bright green MA40 AR coating, challenge swaps, and a double XP boost.
Today, Xbox has revealed what subscribers will be getting this month and, keeping in line with last month’s bonus, you can expect another bright green coating. This time, though, it’s for the warthog.

As noted in the tweet, this month’s bonus comes with challenge swaps which allow you to get rid of a challenge you don’t like and replace it with a new random one as well as double XP boosts, which are 60-minute boosts that earn you double XP for everything you do. 
The announcement tweet does not mention a date for when this month’s bonus will go live.

                    <span>Bandai Namco has revealed My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, a free-to-play battle royale coming to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. 
This new battle royale set in the universe of the popular manga-turned-anime My Hero Academia was announced in the latest issue of Weekly Jump, a Japanese magazine, as reported by Gematsu. All that we can glean of the game so far is what’s shown in Weekly Jump, which Gematsu has two screenshots of, so be sure to check out that report for some more details in Japanese and multiple in-game screenshots. 
“Team up to win a 24-player rumble in multiplayer action,” the magazine reads. 
According to the reveal, Bandai Namco has plans for a closed beta test for My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble, which is not unusual for battle royales or free-to-play games for that matter. As for who to expect in the game, we see All-Might, Shoto Todoroki, Katsuki Bakugo, and of course, Izuku Midoriya. 
As for where this game falls narratively, that’s anybody’s guess although eagle-eyed fans might spot some giveaways that place it after certain events in the show. We won’t spoil any events here because you should either watch or read the very good My Hero Academia. 
Interestingly, Gematsu credits someone on Twitter as finding this magazine announcement but if you look for that tweet, it’s been deleted. Perhaps this Weekly Jump magazine wasn’t out yet and that person got an early copy of it or something; only time will tell. For now, My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble does not have a release date, but we’ll keep our eyes peeled for one. 
For more about this franchise, read about how Legendary Entertainment is giving My Hero Academia the live-action adaptation treatment. Check out our thoughts on My Hero One’s Justice after that.

                    <span>After launching on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, Astroneer, complete with the Xenobiology update, arrives today on Switch. The game has won its share of fans over the years since its launch, and the new content promises to send players on a planet-hopping, story-driven quest to uncover the secrets behind strange extraterrestrial lifeforms. As such, veteran players and would-be fans may be looking at this latest console release as a jumping-in point. Unfortunately, players may find the interstellar game doesn’t fly smoothly on Switch.
System Era Softworks is the development team behind this sci-fi adventure, and it counts amongst its crew experienced industry creators from places like 343 Industries, Valve, and EA. Astroneer allows players to hop into the spacesuit of an intergalactic …</span>

For years, people have sought to understand English culture and history by consulting such artifacts. When future generations wish to understand what England was like in the early 21st century, they&#x27;ll simply need to play a Duke Nukem 3D level. Since June 2021, Dan Douglas has been making a DN3D level which captures facets of the real England: town centres, Wetherspoons, Greggs, a sausage roll nativity, Michael Gove dancing, lads, absolute madmen, life under Covid, performative patriotism, the Brexit bus, and so much more. It&#x27;s astonishing.

                    <span>Roguelike platformer Spelunky 2 is out now on PC Game Pass. I&#x27;m less excited and more angry, actually. This is because it&#x27;s my nemesis, a game I know is good but I&#x27;m absolutely shocking at. Alongside it, the new Left 4 Dead-like co-op shooter The Anacrusis enters early access later today and will be on Game Pass from the start. Can&#x27;t wait to fall into a pit of spikes with one, then blub about my misfortunes in the other as I pew pew aliens.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been over a decade since a core game in The Settlers series last made landfall on PC, and during that time the real-time management landscape has arguably changed quite a bit. There have been some great building games that have risen up, and even developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft Dusseldorf)&#x27;s own Anno series has staked a powerful claim to the city-building throne. But this incarnation of The Settlers isn&#x27;t so much about connecting to the series&#x27; past as it is about laying down foundations for the future. It&#x27;s had a slightly rocky road to launch, suffering several delays and refunded pre-orders after being postponed indefinitely back in 2020, but at long last this reboot of the classic city-building conquest-me-do is finally ready to beat down our door and come barrelling in. It&#x27;s launching in full on March 17th, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early version of the upcoming closed beta build that will be running from January 20th-24th. So settle in, folks. Here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s shaping up.

                    <span>Happy 2022! New year, same old us. The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast will make no effort to change or better ourselves; this is our promise to you, listener. For our first episode of the new year we&#x27;re doing the traditional &quot;what games are we most looking forwards to&quot; episode. Yes, our most anticipated games. There is very little crossover, and lots of orc chat.
Before that, though, we&#x27;re lucky enough to have scored an interview with the &quot;It&#x27;s me, Blorko&quot; guy. Yes, we have the man who came up with this winter&#x27;s most fashionable Marvel-based viral tweet, live and on the podcast (I mean, technically he is on the podcast every week but this week we ask him about the Blorko thing for like 20 minutes).

                    <span>I wouldn’t call it a new year’s resolution – mine for 2022 are learning piano and using fewer dashes – but generally I want to try new things with my PC. And one such opportunity recently presented itself via the new Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight yoke controller: I was going to learn how to fly.


In Microsoft Flight Simulator, obviously, but this honking great console of handles, buttons, joysticks and levers definitely looked like the right tool for the job. A simple flight stick this is not: there’s a full 180-degree yoke handle, an integrated display that can data like flight times, and a modular (but included as standard) throttle quadrant. The kind of thing you might own if your PC resembles a bisected turbine.

                    <span>On a stretch of futuristic tarmac, something clicked. Yellow quest markers hadn&#x27;t built my relationships in Cyberpunk 2077. When a job needed doing, then they&#x27;d steer me in the right direction. But for those initial sparks of story, my cellphone had been key. Chats and texts buzzed into my brain at all hours. &quot;Hey V&quot;, &quot;V, got a minute?&quot;, &quot;V!&quot;
Characters would get in contact with me, not the other way around. And I liked that. In fact, I&#x27;d say it helped build a living, breathing world more than Night City&#x27;s towering skyscrapers and moving billboards. More than, perhaps, any other big RPG I&#x27;ve played over the last couple of years.

They&#x27;ve just held a stream revealing plans for the second year of support and content, giving a look at the new Elusive Target Arcade mode (this time, the murders are permanent, not ephemeral) and announcing Freelancer mode. That will give Ian Hitman a safe house again, and send him out to take down organisations through chains of missions with randomised elements. Plus, the whole trilogy is coming to Game Pass. Lots of news.

Armor Games, a browser gaming titan of yore and more recently a conventional PC publisher too, have announced they&#x27;re switching permanently to a four-day working week of 32 hours. They join a small but growing group of companies in switching, most notably Eidos Montreal who announced last year that they were going to four-day workweeks. Alright, who&#x27;s next?

After entering early access in June 2020, they&#x27;re getting ready to wrap up the story campaign with its final act. Who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll actually make enough money from salvaging spaceships to escape our crippling debt?

                    <span>It&#x27;s probably more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to sidestep around comparisons to Mount &amp; Blade with Sands Of Salzaar. It&#x27;s mostly the structure. Sands Of Salzaar drops you into a world of dynamically warring factions. You can join or compete with them by founding your own, or ignore them to beat up roving bandits, clear out combined dungeon/random encounter sites, and do odd jobs for named NPCs. Some of those figures are powerful, unkillable, and recruitable, although you may have to win them over with favours or gifts. You&#x27;ll likely do a bit of everything, but mostly you&#x27;ll be smashing armies into each other in 2D skirmishes.
It&#x27;s no clone, though. While its component parts are familiar, Salzaar does enough of its own thing to win my affection, and its odd but sincere personality shines despite some muddy edges.

                    <span>The studio co-founded by former Valve writer Chet Faliszek and former Riot designer Kimberly Voll have released The Anacrusis into early access today, a Left 4 Dead-like set in 70s space. Much like its undead predecessor, this is a game where four players team up and pew pew through waves of alien nasties. But it’s not as despairing as its zombified brethren. This is upbeat and colourful and at times, really quite silly.
Yes, it&#x27;s still pretty similar to Left 4 Dead, but is home to a few things that help separate it from its zombified brethren. To test this stuff out, we had a full team of four in our hands-on preview session at the very end of last year – myself, Imogen (RPS in peace), Katharine, and Chet himself, who steered us through encounters with supreme patience. All in all, we sampled a ‘full run’, so a total of four levels, each with lots of, “Oh god, oh no,” moments. And it’s safe to say we had a lot of fun with it.

                    <span>Vědci z Lancasterské univerzity tvrdí, že se přiblížili k řešení kombinujícímu výhody RAM a SSD do jednoho zařízení. Komponenta nazvaná UltraRAM je popisována jako paměťová technologie, která kombinuje stálost datové paměti, jako je flash, s rychlostí, energetickou účinností a trvanlivostí pracovní paměti, jako je DRAM. Technické detaily byly zveřejněny v článku ULTRARAM: A Low-Energy, High-Endurance, Compound-Semiconductor Memory on Silicon.</span>

                    <span>Forever Skies is a newly announced first-person survival game by developer Far From Home. Players control a scientist who returns to a devastated, barely inhabitable Earth to scavenge for remains while making larger discoveries about how the planet has changed.
Earth is covered in a thick layer of toxic dust following an ecological disaster. You don’t know how Earth fell apart in the first place, though, so you’ll brave the environment to uncover artifacts and resources hinting at its demise. Finding ways to grow food and craft tools is also vital. The world’s ecosystem has changed dramatically though, so who knows what dangers you&#x27;ll find hidden beneath the clouds. 
An airbase serves as your floating headquarters. It can be customized to your liking, and you’ll use it as a laboratory, home, and workshop. You also appear to have a variety of tools at your disposal. The trailer shows off a wrist-mounted laser that vaporizes objects, such as a door to access a new area. Forever Skies will begin life as a single-player game, but Far From Home plans to add a co-op mode during its Early Access lifecycle.

Far From Home plans to launch Forever Skies in Early Access sometime this year. Though it will be available first on PC, the team plans to release the game on consoles, of which PlayStation 5 is confirmed, at a later date.

                    <span>A trailer for Amazon Prime Video’s upcoming Critical Role series, The Legend of Vox Machina, has been released alongside new details about the upcoming animated show. 
Amazon released a new Vox Machina trailer today and you can view the standard version below. However, if you’re looking for something more at home with the ramblings of the Critical Role cast that happen on Thursday nights, you might want to check out the red band version of this trailer, which features more gore and no beeps over Vox Machina’s more choice words.

It was revealed today by Variety that The Legend of Vox Machina will be released as a trio of episodes every week, for four weeks, starting on Friday, January 28. In a little over two weeks, the first three episodes will hit Amazon’s Prime Video subscription streaming service, and then the following Friday, another three episodes will be released and so on until the 12-episode Season 1 comes to an end. Don’t sweat, though – a second season has already been greenlit following massive Kickstarter success for this series. That same Kickstarter success also extended the first season from 10 episodes to 12. 
For the uninitiated, The Legend of Vox Machina is an animated series based on the first Critical Role D&amp;D campaign that ran from 2015 to 2017. Like the D&amp;D story it’s based on, the animated series sees Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Liam O’Brien, Marisha Ray, Matthew Mercer, Sam Riegel, Taliesin Jaffe, and Travis Willingham return to their roles. These eight Critical Role voice actors are also executive producing the series alongside Brandon Auman (Star Wars: Resistance) and Chris Prynoski (Metalocaypse). 
For more about Critical Role, check out these two statues released last year and then watch The Legend of Vox Machina red band trailer after that.

Monster Hunter: World was an important paradigm shift for Capcom’s beloved franchise. The well-paced difficulty ramp made progression enjoyable for newcomers, while countless endgame challenges kept expert hunters coming back for more. Monster Hunter Rise’s gameplay often attempts to copy World’s success, which isn’t always a bad thing. Battles continue to be an exhilarating dance with death, gear customization is satisfying, and coordinating hunts with friends makes for awesome fun and unexpected outcomes. Even with the int…</span>

2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series! Please look forward to a variety of #Kirby30 activities coming soon. pic.twitter.com/BZO1rz4LwC
January 12, 2022
The Kirby Twitter account posted about the milestone this morning. The tweet reads, &quot;2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series! Please look forward to a variety of #Kirby30 activities coming soon.&quot; A prior tweet actually announced the anniversary in Japanese and shared a link to a &quot;teaser site&quot; with commemorative wallpapers to celebrate the occasion. A rough translation of the tweet states there may be other &quot;goods and campaigns&quot; coming down the line. For now, the adorable wallpapers are a great way to start Kirby&#x27;s year.
Kirby&#x27;s Dreamland was released in 1992 for the Game Boy, soon after becoming one of the must-have games for the handheld system, at least for me. Its easygoing platforming and whimsical stages and characters set the stage for Kirby&#x27;s subsequent adventures on the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and so on. Here&#x27;s a fun fact about the first game: its Japanese title, Hoshi no Kirby, translates to &quot;Kirby of the Stars,&quot; which explains the absorbent hero&#x27;s penchant for riding and coughing up stars.
What do you want to see from the Kirby 30th anniversary? Are there any lost or forgotten Kirby adventures you&#x27;d like to see collected for Switch or elsewhere? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>PlayStation has released the top 20 PlayStation 5 downloads and PlayStation 4 downloads of 2021, and as you might expect, sports games took home the platinum trophy. 
On the PS5, NBA 2K22 was the number one most-downloaded PS5 game in the U.S. and Canada in 2021 while in Europe, unsurprisingly, FIFA 22 took the top spot. Call of Duty: Vanguard was the number two game in both regions, which, while not necessarily surprising because Call of Duty games always sell well, it’s pretty wild that a game released in November was the number two most-downloaded game of the entire year. 
Along those same lines, Among Us was the number six most-downloaded game of 2021 in the EU, despite releasing in December.
Here’s a full look at the top 10 PS5 games in the U.S. and Canada region:

Last week I was able to buy an Intel Core i5 12400 &quot;Alder Lake&quot; from a major Internet retailer for $209 USD -- and one week later there remains availability during these turbulent supply chain times. The i5-12400 has wound up being a very nice processor for Linux use that exceeded my initial expectations.</span>

                    <span>Nine months after its debut on Nintendo Switch, Monster Hunter Rise today launched on PC. Capcom&#x27;s latest lizard-skinning simulator is a good&#x27;un, and what we played of it pre-release seemed like a solid PC port. However, now the game is out in the world, some would-be players are being blocked out by a bug which doesn&#x27;t let them even start a new save. Still, the majority of folks seem to be quite happily hollowing out dogs to make slippers.

While I&#x27;m at my happiest in water, I know depths and strange sealife give many others the heebie-jeebies. However, heights make me pray for death. So a game about exploring the skies and skyscrapers above the ruins of human civilisation in a customisable airship, ah yes, I would like to die now, thank you very much.

                    <span>Valorant Episode 4 has kicked off, bringing with it new agent Neon who - like that famous blue hedgehog - goes fast. They&#x27;re able to sprint and slide around maps at blistering speeds, which might seem at odds with the game&#x27;s tactical pace, but they fit into the roster nicely. Thing is, you&#x27;ve got to be brave enough to get the most out of their move set, which rewards ballsy plays over careful corner turns. It&#x27;s safe to say I struggled to break out of my tentative shell, but when I did? Hoo boy, what a thrill.

The developers, GSC Game World today announced that they&#x27;ve pushed the launch back by seven months, giving the first-person explore-o-shooter a new release date of the 8th of December. It&#x27;s the usual perfectly sensible reason: they want it to be good, and they think it needs more time to be good.

                    <span>Fatherly axe-‘em-up God of War is out on PC this week, and I’ve been dragging my disappointing son around the Nine Realms to see how it copes with the jump from PlayStation to Windows. The answer: pretty well! Like previous marquee Sony port Horizon Zero Dawn, this is a game that already looked lovely on console, and the extra muscle of even a modest PC rig can deliver sizeable boosts to both visual quality and frames-per-second.

                    <span>In the eight year gap between 2010&#x27;s more conventional sexy gore fest God Of War 3 and this new and improved action-dadventure God Of War, the angry Ancient Greek warboy Kratos handed in his god-killing badge and gun to live in Norse mythology&#x27;s woods with his wife Faye and their son Atreus. When Faye dies, Kratos &amp; Son go on a journey to scatter her ashes from the top of a mountain. This becomes a micro rumination on familial relationships, a macro world-saving epic of legendary proportions, and a hack and slash fest that&#x27;ll have you grinning from ear to ear. On balance, then, I am Team Fridge Faye.
I played this God Of War on its previously exclusive release on PlayStation in 2018, and it lived in my memory as a 70 hour poetic battle between gods and monsters. Revisiting it again on PC, it turns out that it&#x27;s actually only about 20 hours long, but it looms so large as an experience that turning it off at the end feels like stumbling into daylight, having spent many weeks in a firelit, sweaty hunting lodge in a Norwegian pine forest, slamming mead and singing songs about warriors tearing goats in two. There are a lot of big warriors in God Of War. There are a lot of very big things in it in general: statues, dragons, big angry rocks. And a big man, because the titular Kratos, as a yardstick to measure size, is already incongruously big, just so many sacks of salted beef held together by leather armour.

                    <span>Much has been made of how long games take to complete this week. After Dying Light 2 developers Techland boasted that it would take 500 hours to fully complete the game over the weekend, the internet&#x27;s collective groan over the revelation was reportedly heard from the far reaches of space. Personally, I think it&#x27;s a preposterous figure for a single-player game, but as someone who also maintains an active spreadsheet of all my various playtime stats (yes, really), it also got me thinking. Is 500 hours really so nonsensical in the grand scheme of things? I asked the team what their most played game on Steam is to find out.

                    <span>Seminal battle royale shooter Playerunknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds is now free-to-play, inviting all stag and hen parties to parachute into holiday resorts for paintballing which accidentally uses real guns. Folks who previously paid for PUBG: Battlegrounds (the new-ish official name replacing Plunkbat) have been grandfathered into the new Battlegrounds Plus account tier and receive receive some edgy virtual clothes too. Everyone else, hey, in you come.

                    <span>To celebrate anime series Attack On Titan and its impending final series and Call Of Duty&#x27;s next big update, they both decided that a totally normal crossover was in order. Soon, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone will play host to a cursed set of Attack On Titan cosmetics, including gun bits and an Operator skin. They are frightening and confusing. Please avert your eyes.

                    <span>Wordle has engrossed me for a couple of weeks, along with much of the rest of the internet. It&#x27;s also a free, simple word game, meaning it&#x27;s relatively easy to recreate. Naturally, other developers are building their own twists on its core.

Among them, Absurdle is my favourite, an &quot;adversarial version&quot; of the game where the winning word changes as you guess. I&#x27;m also fond of Sweardle, however, a version designed for four-letter words.

So let’s make sure we offer our customers choice between subscriptions and transactions,&quot; says Spencer.

This turned out not to be the exciting selling point they expected for the open-world zombie-mashing parkour-o-shooter. Many found this claim exhausting because oh my god 500 hours is over 20 days, what do you think we do with our lives, and how much of that is busywork? After initially backtracking to clarify that 500 hours is how long it&#x27;d take to do absolutely everything, Techland have now explained that you can finish the game&#x27;s main story in 20 hours, or 80 if you hit every side quest too.

                    <span>Řada společností stále využívá staré aplikace, na kterých často závisí jejich fungování a poskytované služby. Udržování těchto aplikací je přitom velmi složité. Mezi obvyklé problémy patří nevyhovující šifrování, zranitelnost na úrovni serveru i aplikace, případně způsob přihlašování bez možnosti ověření vůči systému správy identit. Přesto je tyto aplikace z mnoha důvodů nutné udržet v chodu.</span>

                    <span>These days, you can&#x27;t shake a stick without bouncing brown beams around the room. Raytracing has been a hot high-end graphics trend for a few years, with new games boasting support for the complex lighting simulators and old games being retrofitted with shine. This year, a new Half-Life mod will add raytracing support to Valve&#x27;s seminal shooter, and even as someone usually perfectly happy with old games looking old, I think it doesn&#x27;t look half-bad. See for yourself in the new video, below.

                    <span>As we’ve already seen from the demo, the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise spruces itself up considerably from the Nintendo Switch original. It’s not a match for Monster Hunter World on overall visual fidelity and detail, but the upside is that it’s easy to go a-huntin’ at high frame rates even if you’re on low end hardware. To whit, Monster Hunter Rise’s PC requirements go even lower than World’s, only asking for a GT 1030 or Radeon RX 550 at minimum.

                    <span>After the roaring success of Monster Hunter: World back in 2018, the idea that the next big PC entry in Capcom&#x27;s dino pants craft &#x27;em up is a game that originally started life on the Nintendo Switch is bound to ruffle a few feathers. But far from being a step down from World, Monster Hunter Rise is every bit its equal - and Capcom&#x27;s stellar work with this PC port has given it a much-needed buff and polish to really make it shine. Not only does Rise offer the same seamless and expansive environments as World, but it also adds a few new twists to make tracking down its titular titans even more enjoyable.

                    <span>Zynga, the company whose games made being Facebook friends with your family even more annoying, are selling to Take-Two. The owners of Rockstar and 2K plan to buy up Zynga shares in a deal that&#x27;ll value the company at $12.7 billion (£9.4b). Take-Two hope to use Zynga&#x27;s social and mobile expertise to make more games based on their games. Sure sure, #business and all, but I&#x27;d rather spend that much money on 9.8 billion Greggs sausage rolls instead of Grand Theft Autoville or something.

                    <span>One of the presents I got for Christmas this year was a copy of PS5 exclusive Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I had about a week where I was completely by myself this year, and I spent it being Spidey and self-yeeting around New York. It&#x27;s a great game on many levels, and I especially liked that one of the outfits you can unlock through story missions is a scarf and ear warmers. Mostly though, it&#x27;s just made me think that web-swinging is the most fun way to get around in games, and more games should do it. By &quot;more games&quot;, I mean &quot;every game&quot;.

                    <span>I briefly posted before the new year about WorldBox - God Simulator, and Graham wrote about it over the weekend, too. It is a world simulation game that has no resource costs or goals, just simulated events. You make a world, plop some animals and fantasy races into it (and if you want, a bunch of dragons and wizards) and see what happens. I cannot stop playing it. And I wanted to give some more detailed examples of how the simulation works, especially if you just leave it running with little intervention.
I am a WorldBox scientist, you see (though merely a BSc at the moment), and my first experiments suggest that every civilisation, along a long enough time scale, is basically doomed. Big 2022 energy. In the case of WorldBox, this may be because at some stage the scientist running the experiment will get bored and drop in e.g. a tornado. That&#x27;s okay, because there are almost infinite experiments to run. I hope that isn&#x27;t how the simulation I am living in is being run. Oh no. Don&#x27;t think about it.

                    <span>Techland have achieved something incredible. With a single Dying Light 2 marketing Tweet, they caused the greatest mass exhalation seen, perhaps, ever. Thousands of adults were informed that to &quot;fully complete Dying 2: Stay Human, you&#x27;ll need at least 500 hours&quot; and collectively sighed at their desks, heads in hands. Even some hurried backtracking from Techland&#x27;s marketing team couldn&#x27;t save us from exhaustion.

                    <span>You know what&#x27;s good? TFI Friday, RPS&#x27;s regular roundup of indie games by Alice B. It&#x27;s where I learned about another good thing: WorldBox, a god sim that entertained me (and my son) over the Christmas holidays.

                    <span>To me, Mass Effect ends about six hours into Mass Effect 1, when I get bored and wander off to play something else. I&#x27;ve had ears and eyes long enough to know that people were upset about the ending of Mass Effect 3 however, even after BioWare tweaked it. The original Mass Effect 3 had various &quot;Happy Ending Mods&quot; to change the close of Commander Shepard&#x27;s story, and now Mass Effect Legendary Edition does, too.

True or not, it&#x27;s definitely happening this week, beginning tomorrow, Sunday January 9th, and running through until Sunday January 16th. This time, the charity speedrunning marathon features several recent games including Deathloop and Death&#x27;s Door, among many others.

                    <span>Developers have good taste in games. That&#x27;s the take away from each year&#x27;s Independent Games Festival Awards, which consistently selects shortlists of excellent games. The nominations for 2022 are up, and the contenders for this year&#x27;s Seumas McNally Grand Prize includes Unpacking, Inscryption, Loop Hero, Cruelty Squad, The Eternal Cylinder and Unsighted. Sounds about right.

I look forward to swimming in sight of some snowy hills today then hiking through some snowy hills tomorrow, then returning to my cosy flat. But what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Video game marketers are eternally trying to one up each other with stupid terms. From the industry which bought you &quot;levelution&quot;, the &quot;drivatar&quot;, and &quot;gameplay trailers&quot; which aren&#x27;t gameplay comes a new one: &quot;gameplay lore trailer&quot;. The year has barely begun but Ubisoft are gunning it out the gate with the new Rainbow Six Siege trailer. This new gameplay lore trailer—yeesh!—explains why a game set within Tom Clancy&#x27;s serious world of paranoid jingoistic masturbation is overrun with a weird parasite mutating people into monsters.

Their latest video melds Mr Bean clips with scenes from Cyberpunk 2077 and goodness me, he seems thrilled to enter a dystopian megacity. You might fear Night City will eat the rubber-faced fool alive, but maybe he&#x27;s the only one of us who could survive it. Come watch!

                    <span>2021 was the year of the time loop wasn&#x27;t it? Deathloop topped a lot of charts and made an appearance in our game of the year list. Twelve Minutes: a timeloop thriller. Lemnis Gate: a tactical FPS where you out time loop one another. The Forgotten City, the Outer Wilds DLC, watching a man throw a “traditional shaped returning” boomerang on YouTube. All of them, time loops.
I’m absolutely sick of them. So here’s me hoping that 2022 is the year of the &quot;time skip&quot;, instead. Or at least, one of these coming years an excessive number of games built around skipping time. Yes, they aren&#x27;t without their flaws, but I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re less repetitive and capable of greater surprise. Alright, at least hear me out.

                    <span>CES is a gloriously mad hodgepodge of different tech fields; the kind where smartphone chip makers share floor space with car manufacturers and sex toys. It’s also one of the biggest showcases of PC gaming hardware in the calendar, and CES 2022 has been no exception, with major component reveals from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia along with loads of gaming laptop, peripheral, and monitor announcements.


This year’s show is technically still going for another day, but like a Foo Fighters album, CES tends to front-load the good stuff. As such, it’s basically safe to start rounding up any PC gaming kit highlights. Some of these have been a long time coming – like the GeForce RTX 3050, Nvidia’s first XX50 desktop GPU with full ray tracing and DLSS support – while others might be pleasant surprises or eye-catching, if likely to be witheringly expensive, new concepts.

                    <span>I was a little worried about Left 4 Dead-alike Rainbow Six: Extraction. You know, after it was announced as Rainbow Six: Quarantine, changed its name, dipped under the radar for ages, then re-emerged with news it was being delayed. Signs pointed to a shaky spin-off from Rainbow Six: Siege&#x27;s popular Outbreak mode. But no, I was totally wrong! After an early hands on with the game, I’m now at ease, at least when I’m at a safe distance. You see, the zombies here may be fewer in number, but they don’t mess about. This makes for a tactical spin on zombie-slaying that truly rewards teamwork, and it’s wonderful as a result.

                    <span>2022 is finally here and that can only mean one thing. We&#x27;ve got another year of hip new video games to look forward to, and we&#x27;ve been busy rustling up the ones we&#x27;re most excited about. In truth, there are tons of games on the horizon that could easily sit on this list, and some of them are so close to release we can practically already see the pixels on our screens morphing into their lush, polygonal landscapes. Games like Monster Hunter Rise, God Of War and Rainbow Six Extraction. You won&#x27;t find them here, but trust us, you&#x27;ll be seeing a lot of them over the coming weeks. 
There are always more games coming out than we have fingers to write about them, but the 2022 games we&#x27;ve listed below are the ones the RPS team are personally most looking forward to playing. We&#x27;ve got games big and small here, and they&#x27;re all listed in alphabetical order. After all, release dates are increasingly slippery beasts these days. Think we&#x27;ve missed something? Why not take to the comments below and tell us all about it. You might just convince us to put it on our radars. But enough from me. Here are our 43 most anticipated games of 2022.

                    <span>Last September, Studio Pixel Punk released Unsighted, a top-down action RPG with a unique time limit on the life of its NPCs. It quickly garnered high praise from critics, including RPS&#x27; own Katharine Castle who named it one of the Best Games You Missed in 2021. To find out more about this indie gem, I got in touch with Studio Pixel Punk&#x27;s pair of developers Fernanda Dias and Tiani Pixel to talk to them about its inspirations, turning off its timer, and the true meaning behind the game&#x27;s name.

                    <span>Developers Might And Delight call Book Of Travels a TMORPG, a &quot;tiny&quot; MMO that&#x27;s focused on fleeting interactions with other players, as opposed to lots of them. It’s a lovely looking adventure with a neat concept, so it was sad to hear that they&#x27;d been hit with layoffs after a difficult launch. However, some heartening news! More levels are on the way, as well as new character customisation tools. They also reaffirmed that despite being a much smaller team than before, they&#x27;re committed to working on the game for the foreseeable.

                    <span>Unsurprisingly, E3 will once again not happen as an in-person event this year, what with the whole global pandemic and all. The Entertainment Software Association, who organise E3, had hoped that the main event on the video games industry&#x27;s marketing calendar would return properly this year, after skipping 2019 and going online in 2020, but nope. While they haven&#x27;t yet confirmed whether or not they&#x27;ll arrange an online E3 in its stead, they seem to be considering it. But even if not, the industry will doubltess manage to host its own advert-o-ramas without the E3 banner.

                    <span>The justice system is stupid. You can go to jail for setting a plant on fire and putting it in your mouth. Shut up, the police. Be smart for once. Maybe people would stop trying to escape from prison if you did something sensible like, I don&#x27;t know, cease being a militarised gang of dirtbag predators. Stop watching everyone through video cameras, you absolute creeps. What? Oh right, video games. Here&#x27;s 9 of the best jailbreaks in PC games.

                    <span>If you listed, ooh, the top ten trends in games over the past year or two, I think you&#x27;d probably include &quot;photo modes&quot; and &quot;petting the dog&quot; on the list. So here comes Pupperazzi, nailing the zeitgeist as a game specifically about taking photos of dogs - who, of course, you can also pet. It&#x27;s now just two weeks away from release, with a January 20th release date.

                    <span>You might have noticed the internet being peppered by little green, white and yellow squares over the past week. They&#x27;re from Wordle, a free once-a-day word puzzle where everyone is trying to guess the same five letter word. I&#x27;ve been hooked on it since Christmas - and you should be playing it, too.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of anime character art, but I could soak in the environment art of Genshin Impact all day long. There are plenty of pretty sights to see in the trailer for version 2.4, the latest update to add a new area, new characters and new weapons to the action-adventure gacha game.

                    <span>I have a strange relationship with Dead Cells. I picked it up in 2019 and played it for a while, by which point I&#x27;d clearly had my fill. No DLCs to my name, nothing. I&#x27;d done a big run and put the game down.
Fast forward to now. Suddenly I own the latest expansion The Queen And The Sea, plus all the DLCs that came before it. I&#x27;m nonchalant, thinking that I dropped the game for a reason. Surely I can&#x27;t be won almost three years later? Well, nope. I was wrong. The DLCs have opened my eyes to the game in ways I hadn’t anticipated. The combat is crunchy, the challenge is thrilling, and Dead Cells more than holds its own next to more modern darlings of the genre like Hades.

Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service today adds BioWare&#x27;s remastered Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy as well as the beautiful clockwork mystery Outer Wilds, which was our favourite game of 2019. The cooperative and chaotic first-person firefighting game Embr hit Game Pass today too but that has, like, gravity? So passé.

                    <span>If you’ve been hankering for more Dead Cells, then you’re in luck. The game’s next paid expansion is out now and has you dive into some nautical newness. It&#x27;s called The Queen And The Sea and is home to shipwrecks and lighthouses infested with monsters, mainly. And a throwable shark. That’s me sold.

In all likelihood, though, that’s not going to happen, so instead let’s put our chins in our palms, angle our heads slightly and gaze off into the sky while picturing all the neat PC hardware that’s launching this year.

                    <span>Konami, the Japanese company best known for squandering every shred of goodwill they built through series like Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, are getting into NFTs. Of course they are. Should&#x27;ve guessed. While publishers like Square Enix, EA, and Take-Two are still contemplating NFTs, I am not remotely surprised that Konami are one of the first notable names to actually start selling useless digital junk. Next week, they will hold an auction for NFTs of videos, artwork, and music from early Castlevania games. Konami, man.

Today they announced a release date of January 18th for Nobody Saves The World, a top-down ARPG with where players can transform into everything from a rogue to a rat, and customise them to be even weirder. It will be on Game Pass, too.

                    <span>Ubisoft today announced a surprising upcoming addition to Game Pass: Rainbow Six Extraction will be available on Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service right from the start when it launches later this month. The monster-mashing spin-off from R6 Siege isn&#x27;t one of their full-price games, coming at a slightly cheaper £34, but still, damn, that&#x27;s a good get. And exactly the sort of game I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy new but would try on Game Pass.
