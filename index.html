                              <span>The whole package is apparently &quot;great value for consumers&quot;.
Rockstar lifted the lid on a Red Dead Redemption port for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 earlier this week, and one of the major talking points since then has been the $50 USD price tag. Some fans feel it&#x27;s simply too much for what appears to be a relatively simple port that&#x27;s actually missing content, although Rockstar is referring to this particular release as a &quot;new conversion&quot;.
Now, speaking to IGN, Rockstar&#x27;s parent company Take-Two Interactive has defended this price point. Company CEO Strauss Zelnick mentioned how this amount is believed to be the &quot;commercially accurate price&quot; for a release like this. He also mentioned how the add-on Undead Nightmare added &quot;great value&quot; to this particular package, although he didn&#x27;t confirm whether or not it was the reason behind the price point.

                              <span>UK-based Indie team Cathedral Studios has announced their upcoming free-to-play horror FPS, The Bornless.
Developers with the studio come from some big franchises including Far Cry, Borderlands, and Call of Duty. Even though the shooter doesn&#x27;t release until 2024, the team plans to host frequent open-access weekends until launch. While most shooters put the story on the backburner, Cathedral Studios wants to make it a big part of The Bornless.
&quot;We aspire to lead in technology, but for us, the story holds paramount importance,&quot; stated Toby Saunders, CEO at Cathedral Studios. &quot;We&#x27;ve strived to weave an immersive, captivating narrative while ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience.&quot;
We also got an Early Access Launch trailer highlighting the creepy goodness that The Bornless has to offer:

                              <span>In case you haven’t heard, Baldur’s Gate 3 is pretty hot right now. Our own Eric “Blast Man” Van Allen is loving what he’s played of it so far, noting that it showcases “a clear love for the role-playing craft at its heart.” Now, that’s all well and good for those who live and breathe D&amp;D. But what about those of us who know basically nothing about Dungeons &amp; Dragons outside of the existence of dungeons and–I’m going out on a limb for this one– possibly some dragons? Well, we&#x27;ve got a Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 guide for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;y5Wx7eFMGkY
Our video team is here to help. In “Ultimate Beginner&#x27;s Guide for Baldur&#x27;s Gate III,” even total newbies will learn how to navigate the game’s early hours. This includes tips like how to build your character, and how to warm up shopkeepers with your spare garbage. As a total D&amp;D newbie, even I felt like I could succeed in Baldur’s Gate 3 after watching this. Whether you’re here for the information or some silly jokes, you should find something to like here.
Of course, this comes hot on the heels of our ongoing Baldur’s Gate 3 coverage. Eric “Sticky Hands” Van Allen shared his own 10 tips for Baldur’s Gate 3, which contains unique tidbits you’ll want to read. He also shared some thoughts about how much Act 1 has changed since the game’s early access build (spoilers: it’s a fair amount). Expect to hear more from us about Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as we make our way through this massive title.

                              <span>At first, the concept of &quot;video game configuration&quot; might seem daunting to less-seasoned players, but in no time, everyone seemingly becomes quite versed in changing settings that they don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s like a little ritual: boot up a new game, head immediately to the Settings tab, and start checking, unchecking, and tinkering with certain modifiers.
What are the settings that most of us immediately change to fit our needs and taste as soon as we try out a new game? We&#x27;ve gathered a few of our go-to&#x27;s here.

                              <span>While we wait for Konami to give us a long-overdue localization of the Parodius series (preferably as a collection), a fan translation has been dropped for 1994’s Super Famicom version of Gokujou Parodius. For the English release, it has been titled Fantastic Parodius! Pursuing the Former Glory.
If you’re unfamiliar with the Parodius series, it’s something of a spin-off or parody of Gradius. Hence the name. The series began in 1988 on the MSX microcomputer before getting a more famous release in arcade in 1990. That title, known as Parodius Da, was ported to various consoles including Game Boy, Famicom, and Super Famicom. The follow-up to Parodius Da is what we have here, known as Gokujou Parodius and sometimes as Fantastic Journey.

                              <span>Typically Nintendo rolls out My Nintendo rewards for upcoming or recently-released first-party games, but this time they&#x27;re returning to July 2022&#x27;s Xenoblade Chronicles 3, which just hosted a newish DLC. The reward is a coaster set priced at a whopping 700 Platinum Points, and it comes with four coasters and two sticker sheets.
Here&#x27;s the full description of the set from Nintendo:
&quot;This set of four coasters features artwork of characters Noah, Mio, Eunie, Taion, Lanz, Sena, Riku and Manana from the game. The coaster set also comes with two sheets of character stickers. These coasters work well when relaxing with a cup of coffee, tea, or cocoa, just like when you&#x27;re at a Rest Stop in the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 game. Each coaster features a cork underside and a laminated top. The set comes in an adventure-ready metal container.&quot;

To be fair to its higher point-based price, it also has those stickers, and a metal container. It&#x27;s important to note (as the description says) that the coasters themselves aren&#x27;t metal: they&#x27;re cork/laminated on top. Still, that&#x27;s far better than some of the past My Nintendo paper coaster offerings that practically melt after a few uses.
Need Platinum Points?
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked

                              <span>Today’s the day. The Broforce Forever update to Devolver Digital and Free Lives 2015 muscle-hit Broforce has arrived.
Grab your best (or most reliable) bro for some bro-op today. According to the news post about it, Broforce Forever is the result of years of disappointing attempts at creating further bro content. According to the devs “We had various elaborate ideas for the update - including things such as procedurally generated levels, or a standalone roguelite spinoff version of the game. Unfortunately, for various reasons - mostly that the ideas were bad and the execution worse - they did not work out.”
https://youtu.be/8c2aYrFV9uE
What we wound up with is an expanded campaign, new challenge levels, new enemies, and six new bros. This includes characters based on John Spartan from Demolition Man, El Mariachi from Desperado, and lady-bro Buffy from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Oomph! Can you even talk about Broforce without flexing? I can’t. Hurgh!
My husband and I did some bro-op through Broforce back when we were still dating. It was an early demonstration of the gulf in skill between us when it came to platformers. Anytime a level required us to jump across some tricky ledges, I had to take the lead. It was a good time, but my husband is still a scrub.
The Broforce Forever update is available now for free on PC, Switch, Xbox One, and PS4. Hunf!

                              <span>NatsumeAtari and ININ have announced that the next retro revival from Tengo Project will be Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn. This is described as a “completely new production” but is based on the 1990 NES game, Shadow of the Ninja, also known as Blue Shadow in Europe and Yami no Shigotonin Kage in Japan. It’s set for release in Spring 2024.
Tengo Project is the studio behind Wild Guns Reloaded and last year’s Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined. Both are based on rather obscure retro games in their own right, but both are absolutely stellar.
https://youtu.be/5u6KyZsKNLo
I must admit that I haven’t yet played Shadow of the Ninja, but it’s on the Switch Online NES channel, so why the hell not? However, it has been on my radar for years now. It’s well remembered for being a rad ninja platformer, but more importantly, because it had a two-player coop. That multiplayer will be retained for Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn, as it brings back Hayate and Kaeda.
Perhaps, more importantly, is that they’re also bringing in Iku Mizutani to compose the soundtrack. Not only was Mizutani the original composer on the 1990 version, but he also created the soundtrack to 1991’s Shatterhand and the PC-88 version of Snatcher.
Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in Spring 2024.

                              <span>After briefly teasing it last week, Behaviour Interactive has released the full details of their upcoming Dead by Daylight: Alien crossover. If you aren&#x27;t content playing as the Survivor Nic Cage, you&#x27;ll now be able to play as Ellen Ripley. Those looking for a new Killer will get the classic Xenomorph alien from the movies. Furthermore, players will be able to escape the Xenomorph in a new Nostromo Wreckage map themed after the crashed ship.
“Alien has been and continues to be one of the best sci-fi stories ever told – and to be able to collaborate with 20th Century Games on bringing this story into Dead by Daylight is a privilege for all of us at Behaviour Interactive,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Behaviour Interactive.
The Xenomorph takes Stealth Killer to the next level, striking Survivors from the shadows with its razor-sharp tail. The Alien Killer also has a power called Runner Mode allowing it to walk more stealthily on four legs, reducing its Terror Radius.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;E3XKx4KKCXU
Some other cool new additions as well
A new interactive Map function called Control Stations is scattered throughout the Nostromo Wreckage map. Seven in total will spawn, allowing Survivors to interact with them to get a new Tool: the Remote Flame Turret. Also, the Xenomorph will be able to enter and exit tunnels underneath the Control Station, making it versatile for everyone.
The new Remote Flame Turret tool has a defensive attack that staggers the Xenomorph and ends its unique power. Furthermore, the tool adds a complex gameplay element as Survivors will have to strategically place the turret and use it at an ideal time. Also, if the turret overheats, players need to repair and protect it as the Xenomorph can destroy it.
The Dead by Daylight: Alien crossover is releasing on all platforms on August 29.

                              <span>If you thought annual Call of Duty releases were a thing of the past, think again. It&#x27;s barely been a year since the reboot of Modern Warfare II came out, and now Modern Warfare III is nearly upon us already.
In a recent teaser uploaded to the official Call of Duty YouTube channel, it&#x27;s been announced that MWIII will launch on November 10. At the time of writing, there&#x27;s been no indication on what platforms the latest in the ongoing FPS series will be on. Rest assured, it will almost certainly be on the major current-gen systems, and possibly some previous-gen as well.

As for the teaser itself, it&#x27;s just over 40-seconds long and doesn&#x27;t really give a lot away. It seems this will be a direct sequel to 2022&#x27;s Modern Warfare II, which in itself is a reboot of 2009&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2.
Hidden messages
Eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed some numbers at the start of the clip. According to Polygon, this is actually a phone number. When a text message is sent to it, it reveals the following:
*** COMMS SECURED ***
major conflict incoming. a lot of opportunity.
we need someone like you, with experience in al mazrah
are you able to receive sensitive intel
yes / no
[upon responding yes]
good
expect mission critical intel. a taste of what’s to come

Seems very on-brand with the Call of Duty vibe.
As mentioned above, Modern Warfare II was released less than a year ago. It received fairly decent reviews and scores overall. Modern Warfare III continues the trend of Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games putting a new stamp on older entries. Will it be a rousing success? I mean, it&#x27;s Call of Duty. It&#x27;s going to sell in droves no matter what.

                              <span>Responsible for leaving a lasting impression on the gaming world, Tomb Raider is still going strong, even if it&#x27;s not as paradigm-shifting as it once was. That said, there&#x27;s still love for Lara Croft and her adventures, and one creator has been tweaking the original 1996 release.
YouTube user Dominus Aurate (as spotted by WCCF Tech) recently uploaded video footage from the OG Tomb Raider. Except in this instance, the legendary game has been given a bit of a lighting facelift, specifically when it comes to path tracing, thanks to Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix tech.

Although it still pretty much looks the same in terms of its textures and polygonal aging, there have been some noteworthy changes to the lighting and shadow effects. It looks very impressive, breathing new life into the 27-year-old release.
Those tombs won&#x27;t raid themselves
It&#x27;s nice to see the 1996 entry still getting some attention after all these years. Tomb Raider made waves for its 3D adventure story and gameplay mechanics (at a time when 3D was starting to take off).
It also introduced the world to Lara Croft, who quickly became one of the gaming world&#x27;s most recognizable characters. She&#x27;s still gracing modern systems and the series has sold millions of copies worldwide.
Croft (or her manor, at least) has also appeared in games like PowerWash Simulator, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (best known for creating the critically acclaimed sitcom Fleabag) is writing Tomb Raider for a TV series.
In short, Croft is by no means done for. The older installments may look dated now, but it&#x27;s nice to see modern technology giving a fresh look to a retro game.

                              <span>People can&#x27;t get enough of Yoshi. He&#x27;s happy, he&#x27;s an incredibly useful power-up from time to time, and he&#x27;s cute. What more could you want out of a companion? Well, more official artwork would be a start! New art of the adorable dino popped up on the Nintendo UK Twitter account this week, showing off a straw-hat-donning Mario with a yellow Yoshi pal. Nintendo is calling it an &quot;Original Mario wallpaper&quot; work, celebrating this very-hot summer of 2023.
We&#x27;re big Yoshi fans in my household. Not only do we constantly relive games where Yoshi is playable, but we also can&#x27;t help but smile every time he turns up. I also spent an inordinate amount of time in Yo&#x27;ster Isle in Super Mario RPG and will do so yet again when the remake arrives later this year. I&#x27;m really feeling the vibe of this artwork, though my summer experience doesn&#x27;t look anything like this!
Where to download the Mario and Yoshi Summer 2023 wallpaper
You can find the original source here on Nintendo of Japan&#x27;s site, which includes the following resolution options:
1080 x 1920
1200 x 1920
1242 x 2688
1536 x 2048
1920 x 1080
Note that you will need a Nintendo account to download the wallpaper directly, though there isn&#x27;t a Platinum Point/My Nintendo requirement/cost associated with it.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents presentation, we saw Mewtwo announced as an upcoming Tera Raid encounter in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. However, another legendary Pokemon has made its appearance, and this one&#x27;s much easier to get. Specifically, virtually anyone who owns either Pokemon Scarlet or Pokemon Violet can claim Mew as a mystery gift right now.
Until Monday, September 18, trainers can use the code GETY0URMEW in the Mystery Gift menu to instantly grab Mew. That&#x27;s a zero and not an O in &quot;Y0UR,&quot; since you can&#x27;t input O, I, or Z in codes. For those who need a refresher, you can get to Mystery Gifts by selecting the Poke Portal option in the in-game main menu. Select &quot;Mystery Gift&quot; at the bottom of the menu that pops up, and then select &quot;Get with Code/Password.&quot; If you input the code right, you should grab Mew right away.

That said, not all Mews are created equal. Mew&#x27;s moves and Tera Type will differ between each player, so you may see some funky results. For example, my Mew has a Ground Tera Type and knows Earth Power, Swift, Light Screen, and Life Dew. A little random for my endgame focused file, but Earth Power would wreck house in the early game. Anyone who can access the Mystery Gift option during this period can claim Mew, including new players.
It always feels a little surreal to me whenever I see Mew given away like this. I mean, I know these legendary Pokemon distributions happen all the time these days. But after the schoolyard hysteria over getting Mew back in the Red &amp; Blue era, I always expect to just get this monster with a glitch or a GameShark. I don&#x27;t know how great Mew will fare against Mewtwo specifically, but my Life Dew Mew will help me on my quest to always use healers in Tera Raids.

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet have had an interesting run of Tera Raid events. Until now, most of the 7-Star encounters have revolved around starters from previous games, usually with a strategically picked Tera Type that makes them tricky to take down. But now, with the impending release of DLC for Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, Mewtwo is here to kick the Tera Raid intensity up a notch.
From September 1 to September 17, Mewtwo will appear as a Tera Raid in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. It will sport the Psychic Tera Type, so needless to say, this thing&#x27;s Psychic attacks will hit hard. Normally, I would say this means Dark-type Pokemon will prevail. But if there&#x27;s one thing I know about Tera Raid Pokemon, it&#x27;s that they love to punish their obvious weaknesses. Aura Sphere will almost certainly appear in Mewtwo&#x27;s move pool.
To help trainers prepare, Scarlet &amp; Violet will see promotional raids throughout August that drop some key items to strengthen your team. The first encounter will appear from August 9 to August 17, with the second encounter running from August 19 to August 31. We didn&#x27;t receive specifics about these raids, but I&#x27;d expect something similar to a 5-Star Blissey raid. In other words, an easy loot piñata for trainers to take down in a minute before claiming rewards.
If you read my older Tera Raid guides, you could probably tell how exhausted I felt after a while. The release schedule just got so fast, and I can only use Annihilape so much before it gets stale. However, with legendary Pokemon entering the fray, I might dip into the scene again. This monster harassed me enough in Pokemon Stadium, so I&#x27;ve got a score to settle.

                              <span>During the August 8 Pokemon Presents, The Pokemon Company announced two classic Pokemon titles are coming to Nintendo Switch Online. First up is the Pokemon Trading Card Game which came out on Gameboy Color in 1998. The second is Pokemon Stadium 2 which hit N64 in 2000.
Both titles are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service today, August 8. While it appears Pokemon TCG will be available on the base NSO service, Pokemon Stadium 2 requires the Expansion Pack.
While Pokemon TCG certainly isn&#x27;t one of the traditional Pokemon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, etc., it&#x27;s still fantastic. In fact, I remember playing it after those titles and thinking it was such a unique take on Pokemon. Instead of choosing a Pokemon at the start, players choose from one of three different TCG decks and begin their adventure to become the world&#x27;s greatest TCG player. Similar to traditional games, you head out to defeat the eight Club Masters and earn their Medals, comparable to Badges.
Pokemon Stadium 2 is a sequel to the original which is actually the first time we saw Generation II Pokemon in full 3D. Back in 2000, the popular sequel was also the only Pokemon title to use the N64 Expansion Pak. In Pokemon Stadium 2, players focused more on Pokemon battles rather than catching them all.
Overall these are two great Pokemon titles being added to the service. Hopefully, this will also pave the way for the more traditional Pokemon GBC titles to come later.

                              <span>Mega Cat Studios’ WrestleQuest has turned heads thanks to its gorgeous pixel art world that blends RPG fantasy exploration with wrestling action. Though it was originally slated for an August 8 release, the game has since been delayed to August 22 on all platforms.
https://twitter.com/skyboundgames/status/1688712585175261184
It is a brief delay triggered by a slight bug developers found. As a Tweet by Skybound Games explains, it was “discovered that it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices.”

WrestleQuest gets pushed back a few weeks
The delay may be disappointing, though the stated reason for it is understandable. WrestleQuest has hours of content, taking players on a journey to become the greatest pro wrestler. The tweet also suggests that WrestleQuest will have cross-save capabilities.
Early impressions of the game have been mostly positive, with critics praising the art style and its engagement with the wrestling world. A few real-world wrestling superstars also make an appearance, including Andre the Giant, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, and Jeff Jarrett.
The delay may have been necessary, but it does push WrestleQuest into quite a busy time in gaming. It launches in the same week as Immortals of Aveumn and Armored Core 6. Sea of Stars, another pixel art game, releases the following week on August 29.

                              <span>The first DLC excursion of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have a release date. Part 1, The Teal Mask, arrives on September 13, and its follow-up The Indigo Disk arrives in winter 2023.
A trailer shown during today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents dove into what we can expect from Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s two-part DLC, both set to arrive this year. The Teal Mask follows two trainers, Carmine and her younger brother Kieran, as we get wrapped up in a festival and local folklore.

Of course, there are new Pokémon to catch. Dipplin is a dipped version of Applin. It looks like some special Pokémon are also tied into the folk tale surrounding the Festival of Masks we can attend.
Perrin, a Pokémon photographer, will also be around to give players missions to snap shots. A raci…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Legend Bowl was built to fill that void for football fans&quot;.
Over the past few years, the number of arcade-style American football titles on Switch has increased at a pretty steady rate. We recently saw Retro Bowl bring us back to the game&#x27;s 8-bit roots, and Saber is looking to bring even more big-head Playgrounds-esque charm to the game with Wild Card Football later this year. This is football at its most simplistic, so where do you turn if you want to experience the complexities of the game?
The answer might be Legend Bowl, a new American football sim from publisher Top Hat Entertainment and developer Super Pixel Games that aims to show the tactical side of the sport both on and off the field. We were recently able to chat with the game&#x27;s lead developer, Javier Martinez, to find out what went into making Legend Bowl stand out from the crowd.

This review originally went live in 2016, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 library.

After all the groundbreaking success that Pokémon&#x27;s first generation had, it would&#x27;ve only been wise for the powers that be to capitalise on the franchise. How was this done? Game Freak launched a new set of games – Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal – in the late &#x27;90s (or early 2000s, depending on the region) and this of course meant a slew of new monsters to catch and train all over again. This also yielded new sets of trading cards, a new series of anime, new merchandise, new manga, and everything in between. It&#x27;s a formula that&#x27;s continued to work ever since, and it was only logical that Nintendo also followed suit in the console department with a sequel on the Nintendo 64 – Pokémon Stadium 2.

Serious question
There was a Pokémon Presents showcase today, and while they&#x27;ve gained something of a reputation for not being the most scintillating of Nintendo-related presentations, there&#x27;s usually something worth tuning in for, even if you&#x27;re a latent Pokéfan who drifted away after Gen I.

This review originally went live in 2014, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy / Game Boy Color library.

It’s almost surreal nowadays to think that there was ever a time when portable gaming didn’t have Pokémon. When Red and Blue first hit Western shores in 1998, those 151 legends would bring with them a wave of merchandise, cementing the series in history as the cultural epidemic it really was. Airplanes, cars, buildings; all were infected by the Pokévirus, but none were quite so potent as the powerhouse that was the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Wizards of the Coast first brought them to the US in 1999, and the rest is school playground history. Can a Game Boy Color title truly recreate the ferocious rivalry and friendship-destroying power these physical cards held?

The Pokémon Presents August 2023 showcase has come and gone, bringing with it 35 minutes of updates on the world of Pokémon and announcements for new and upcoming PokéProjects, including fresh details on the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero. It certainly wasn&#x27;t the most exciting of Pokémon Presents, but looking back it did contain a fair few announcements.
Below we cover every announcement from the August 8th Pokémon Presents showcase, plus relevant trailers and links to our in-depth coverage across the site. And if you missed the presentation and want to catch up, you&#x27;ll find the archived video at the bottom of the page.

Detective Pikachu is back! We first heard about the aptly-titled Detective Pikachu Returns back in the June Nintendo Direct showcase, but today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents has given us the chance to see what the upcoming title is all about away from all of the Mario announcements that stole our attention in June.
Yes, we now have a brand new trailer showing what is going down in Ryme City. Detective Pikachu is still on the hunt for his owner, Harry Goodman, and is once again teaming up with Tim to crack any cases that pop up along the way. The mysteries seem cute and friendly (would we really want them any other way?) and the wise-cracking titular &#x27;mon is still hooked on coffee.

Everyone&#x27;s favourite apple dragon has got a brand new evolution thanks to Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Revealed during today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents August 2023 showcase, Dipplin is a new evolution for Applin that looks a bit like a candy apple — it&#x27;s adorable, it&#x27;s perfect, it was the best thing we saw during the whole showcase.
Dipplin will be making its debut in The Teal Mask, which launches on 13th September 2023. During that DLC&#x27;s story, it will be the partner Pokémon of Kieran, a trainer from the Blueberry Academy. It will be Grass/Dragon type, just like all other evolutions for Applin.

While the announcement of Red Dead Redemption for the Switch and PlayStation 4 comes as a pleasant surprise for some, unsurprisingly not everyone is overjoyed about this announcement.
After the troubled Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy release which &quot;significantly exceeded&quot; sales expectations, it seems the simple port of John Marston&#x27;s original adventure (supposedly &quot;a new conversion&quot; according to Rockstar) may have pushed some within this community to their breaking point - with many fans of the company now essentially calling for a boycott.

Dragon Quest RPGs have become a staple of the Nintendo Switch and later this year the hybrid system will receive the spin-off Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince.
This game is a little bit different from traditional entries in the series. Instead of directly fighting opponents, you take on the role of an aspiring Monster Wrangler who is out for revenge. In an update, Square Enix has now officially revealed the box art for Japan, designed by series artist, character designer and legend Akira Toriyama.

Early last month, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom got another update - bumping the game up to a new build and adding a special feature allowing Switch users to redeem items from the system&#x27;s news channel in the game.
Nintendo has been making use of this feature ever since - with a number of free item giveaways. In case you missed it, the latest Zelda news channel post is now live. This time it runs players through the basics of taking a selfie, using a picture of Link with Purah as an example. If you read through the story, at the bottom you&#x27;ll be able to redeem a special &quot;Golden Apple&quot; in the game.

                              <span>How does it compare to the past gen version?
After a number of rumours, Rockstar Games has revealed its wild west action-adventure Red Dead Redemption, starring John Marston, is returning next week on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
If you&#x27;re curious to know how the game looks in comparison to one of the original versions, then you might want to take a look at GameXplain&#x27;s video above.

                              <span>This Patch Tuesday brings a new and potentially painful processor speculative execution vulnerability... Downfall, or as Intel prefers to call it is GDS: Gather Data Sampling. GDS/Downfall affects the gather instruction with AVX2 and AVX-512 enabled processors. At least the latest-generation Intel CPUs are not affected but Tigerlake / Ice Lake back to Skylake is confirmed to be impacted. There is microcode mitigation available but it will be costly for AVX2/AVX-512 workloads with GATHER instructions in hot code-paths and thus widespread software exposure particularly for HPC and other compute-intensive workloads that have relied on AVX2/AVX-512 for better performance.</span>

                              <span>In 2022, MindGeek subsidiary MG Premium prevailed in its legal battle against the operator of Daftsex and several other pirate sites. MG was awarded $32m in damages and permission to seize domain names but to date, nothing has been paid, and the sites are still in business. Mindful that his injunction is being ignored, a U.S. judge has just held the persistent pirate in contempt of court and declared MG Premium the new owner of his pirate domains.

                              <span>Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. 
I&#x27;ve been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction&#x27;s reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There&#x27;s only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.

                              <span>I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2 playthrough). I&#x27;ve just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they&#x27;re standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&amp;D player handbook. 
These feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to &quot;alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires&quot;, up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it&#x27;s far from certain that they&#x27;ll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There&#x27;s a good reason for this: higher level D&amp;D spells and abilities are so potent it&#x27;s hard to include them without turning Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 characters into gods.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&amp;D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There&#x27;s one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.

                              <span>The curious journey of Ironmace&#x27;s medieval extraction sim Dark And Darker continues with the launch of an early access build. You won&#x27;t find it in one of the usual places, however. As Kaan reported in April, Dark And Darker was pulled from Steam following accusations of copyright theft from publisher Nexon (Ironmace&#x27;s founder Terence Park and a developer Ju-Hyun Choi are Nexon alumni who worked on a similar fantasy game, codenamed P3, in 2020-2021). With legal proceedings on-going, Ironmace have released this tense first-person dungeon crawler via their own Blacksmith launcher and third-party store Chaf Games. It&#x27;s a bit more ceremonial than letting people torrent the test builds, at least.

                              <span>Activision have finally given the much-teased Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 remake a release date - November 10th. Here&#x27;s your teaser trailer, in which the camera skydives through a cosmic wilderness of glowing red waveforms while returning adversaries Captain Price and Vladimir Makarov apparate briefly to the rear. There are mysterious husky whisperings - &quot;he&#x27;s not new&quot;, &quot;never bury your enemies alive&quot; - and you fly through a giant stone wolf&#x27;s head. What does all this bode? I&#x27;m going to say &quot;shooting&quot;.

                              <span>For composer Austin Wintory, Stray Gods started with a rejected pitch.
Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory&#x27;s friend was less than enthusiastic.
&quot;He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, &#x27;I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,&#x27;&quot; Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I&#x27;m currently interviewing him about.
While his unnamed friend wasn&#x27;t interested, he did point Wintory towards Liam Esler, a developer with similar ambitions for fi…</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents gave us lots of updates on upcoming Pokémon titles, like Detective Pikachu Returns, the classic games coming to Switch Online, and even new raids for Mewtwo in Scarlet and Violet. However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here&#x27;s everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you&#x27;ll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…</span>

                              <span>If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they&#x27;ll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.</span>

                              <span>Detective Pikachu Returns got a new trailer during this morning’s Pokemon Presents, running down the cast of characters and pocket monsters you’ll encounter during your investigations.
Our chatty electric rodent is, of course, joined by his human partner Tim Goodman. The trailer also reacquaints us with Tim’s family, his friend Rachel and her major father, along with some of the Pokémon lending a helpful hand like the clue-sniffing Growlithe. The trailer also shows off some of the investigative gameplay.


Detective Pikachu Returns arrives on Switch on October 6. For our thoughts on the first game, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password &quot;GETYOURMEW&quot; before September 18. Each Mew&#x27;s Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon&#x27;s flexible capabilities. You&#x27;ll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you&#x27;re able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect &quot;something special.&quot;
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions.

                              <span>Two classic Pokémon games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today in the form of Pokémon Trading Card Game and Pokémon Stadium 2. Both will be available later today.
Pokémon Trading Card Game was released for the GameBoy in 1998 and has a similar format to the traditional RPG series, except you&#x27;re battling with cards instead of actual monsters. Pokémon Stadium 2 arrived in the U.S. for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 and is, obviously, the sequel to the first Stadium, which is already available on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. 
While these aren&#x27;t the much-requested Red/Blue/Yellow games (or any RPG, for that matter), this is a step in the right direction. Be sure to check out our complete list of every game available on Nintendo Switch Online to keep up with each addition.</span>

Též víme, že EU chce tento vlak dohnat, ve hře jsou různé pobídky a další nabídky pro výrobce čipů, které se neodmítají. I v rámci diversifikace rizik plynoucích z čínských akcí v Jihočínském moři / u Tchaj-wanu je každopádně jedině dobře, že TSMC připravuje továrnu na čipy v Německu. Tento krok totiž nyní schválila správní rada tohoto nejlepšího světového výrobce čipů.</span>

                              <span>Podpisové klíče MS Azure AD byly ukradeny a následně byly využity k  nabourání se do amerických vládních emailových schránek v MS Azure pomocí falešných ověřovacích tokenů. První problém byl, že MS neměl klíče dobře zabezpečeny (nechával je v exportovatelném formátu v nějakém programu), dalším problémem bylo, že MS Azure akceptoval vypršené klíče. MS zároveň neposkytl podrobnosti o tom, co se stalo (problém bude asi závažnější). Je velmi pravděpodobné, že Čína má k dispozici zdrojové kódy jak MS produktů, tak i MS Azure. Údajně je získala kvůli malware, který Rusko zaneslo do aktualizace produktu SolarWinds. Tuto aktualizaci si údajně stáhlo kolem 14 000 klientů a je velmi pravděpodobné, že infrastruktury těchto klientů (včetně MS) byly napadeny / vykradeny ještě před tím, než se na malware přišlo a byl odstraněn.

More than a quarter of all reported links, relating to a single website, were sent by MindGeek, the parent company of PornHub.

The orders are yet to appear in public, but we&#x27;re informed that the Premier League will be able to block pirate IPTV services during the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons. Interestingly, the Sky order seems to cover a much shorter period but does identify six pirate IPTV services by name.

                              <span>The story surrounding the popular multiplayer fantasy dungeon crawler Dark and Darker just keeps getting crazier. Despite their current ongoing lawsuit with Nexon, Ironmace plans on releasing Dark and Darker in Early Access today. For now, Ironmace has partnered with subscription-based gaming platform Chaf Games. A purchase button is currently available on the Dark and Darker store page on Chaf Games but does not appear to be working at this time.[Update: Looks like it is officially available now, at this link.]
After a very popular beta period earlier this year, South Korean developer Ironmace was met with a lawsuit from Nexon claiming Dark and Darker had many similarities to its game in development titled P3.
Furthermore, Nexon alleged that a former employee named Mr. Choi leaked P3 asse…</span>

                              <span>As promised, Devolver Digital streamed their Devolver Delayed showcase today. In typical Devolver fashion, the showcase lasted a whopping three minutes with the goal of turning a negative announcement into a positive one. The upbeat video offered an opportunity to celebrate the games we can&#x27;t play yet.
Overall, the video had a bit of a Nintendo Direct vibe with a similar red and white color theme. Furthermore, the narrators in the background of the video kept an upbeat tone as they went through each title one by one. As I said, classic Devolver Digital fashion.
Here&#x27;s the three-minute Devolver Delayed Showcase in its entirety:

                              <span>The original Red Dead Redemption will come to the PS4 and Nintendo Switch in a little over a week. This is great news, as we&#x27;re talking about one of the very few highly successful games of the post &#x27;2010s that hasn&#x27;t seen a single re-release. Few feelings beat knowing that the wait is over—even when we didn&#x27;t know we were waiting for something in the first place.

Though Rockstar isn&#x27;t calling it a remaster, this RDR release developed by Double Eleven Studios looks a bit sharper than it did on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. An actual HD remaster was reportedly on the table for some time, but plans seem to have dissipated. From the way Rockstar is promoting it, it seems like the company is just going for an uncompromisingly straightforward re-release.
This is definitely not the RDR remake in Unreal Engine or in the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that some have been speculating about for a while. The Red Dead Redemption re-release will also contain the famous Undead Nightmare DLC. This neat add-on clearly banked on the &#x27;2010s zombie craze by taking John Marston in a possibly non-canonical side quest against hordes of undead cowboys, but it&#x27;s still pretty fun to play nowadays.
Red Dead Redemption for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch will cost $49.99. The digital format will be up for download on August 17. The physical version will come out on October 13. The PS4 version will also run on PS5.

With record entrants and an already warm reception, it&#x27;s easy to say expectations were high. Still, I don&#x27;t think we could have expected the stellar grand finals Street Fighter 6 got.
Let&#x27;s set the stage a bit, first. The Evolution Championship Series, or Evo, is one of the most storied and respected fighting game tournaments around. Alongside its massive attendance, Evo is also an open tournament, so anyone can put up the entrance money and fight. To win Evo is to, by extrapolation, beat everyone at Evo. And with Street Fighter 6 garnering an all-time record in entrants, there was no shortage of talent on display.

                              <span>I remember where I was when Blue Dragon was announced. Although I already had an Xbox 360 and was ready for it, some folks I knew bought one just for it given who was involved (Nobuo Uematsu, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Akira Toriyama): as Mistwalker and Microsoft Game Studios made a mad dash to put out more games from Japanese studios on the Xbox ecosystem.
So how did it actually go? Well, it depends on who you ask. For some, it was a dazzling RPG that stayed with them long after the credits rolled (no doubt in part due to famed artist Akira Toriyama&#x27;s character designs), and helped pave the way for better games just like it. For others, it was a run-of-the-mill project that relied heavily on its presentation, without bringing a whole lot to the table compared to similar games before it. It&#x27;s also roughly 50 hours long (originally across three discs), so if you aren&#x27;t into it early on, odds are you&#x27;ll fall off way before the end.
You can find out for yourself how it all went down with our new Lost in Time series, which will be airing every other week on the Destructoid YouTube channel. It&#x27;s also still on sale digitally for $19.99 on the Xbox storefront and is playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.
If you&#x27;re interested in hearing more about this often-forgotten RPG, check out the video on it below. The video team is currently looking for feedback on this series and what you might want to see in the future: so let them know in the YouTube comments!

                              <span>Windows will almost certainly be the default operating system for more PC users and gamers. However, Linux seems to be slowly climbing the ranks, and it&#x27;s now the second most popular OS on Steam, which could be owing to Valve&#x27;s handheld device, the Steam Deck.
According to a report from Phoronix (as spotted by Ars Technica), Linux saw its share of the market increase by half a percent for June, giving it a 1.96% share of the operating system pie.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_395246&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;aligncenter&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;640&quot;] Screenshot via Destructoid.[/caption]
This means, as of now, it&#x27;s beaten macOS, which currently has a market share of 1.84%. Of course, both pale in comparison to Windows, with the anonymous Steam survey showing that the Microsoft OS dominates with a whopping 96.21% share.
Are more people turning to Linux then?
The one thing that needs to be taken into account is that much of this increase in Linux usage may well be down to the Steam Deck itself. The portable PC comes preinstalled with the SteamOS software, which is built on a custom version of Linux.
Ergo, anyone who buys a Deck to play games through their Steam account will be shown as being a Linux user. The version &quot;SteamOS Holo&quot; 64-bit was the most popular Linux version reported, which adds to the Steam Deck&#x27;s case. It&#x27;s also worth noting that not everyone will have taken the survey, but any discrepancies may not be significant anyway.
If anything, it kind of shows the popularity of the Steam Deck, that it&#x27;s managed to influence the operating system market in this way. While companies like ASUS are offering their own alternatives, the Valve machine is still a force to be reckoned with in terms of mobile PC gaming.

                              <span>If you ever want an understanding of how Skyrim has managed to stay alive these past 12 years, just look to the modding community. There are tons of ways to tweak The Elder Scrolls 5, and a new one has recently come out that takes cues from one of Rockstar&#x27;s most critically acclaimed releases.
Over on Nexus Mods, veteran modder JaySerpa has been at it once again. This time, they&#x27;ve brought the sport of hunting to the chilly world of Skyrim. Called &quot;Simple Hunting Overhaul,&quot; it gives the Dragonborn the ability to take time out from all that hero questing and dragon slaying.
https://youtu.be/m1aK9Njuxbo
You can skin the corpses of animals that have been killed, which you can then sell to vendors in a nearby town or city. Typical with JaySerpa&#x27;s projects, this mod also incorporates NPC reactions to your hunting, making for a more immersive experience.
The creator says this Skyrim hunting mod of theirs was inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2. No prizes for guessing which particular aspect of the game.
Who even plays vanilla Skyrim these days?
If you play the game on PC, you&#x27;ll already be very familiar with the near-countless ways you can mess with Bethesda&#x27;s epic 2011 RPG. Because, let&#x27;s face it: after well over a decade, the cracks in Skyrim are more than showing.
The vanilla experience is still fun, but there&#x27;s no sense in pretending that it&#x27;s not aged quite significantly. This is where modding comes to the rescue, and people like JaySerpa are responsible for keeping TES5 very much in the limelight. That, and Bethesda wouldn&#x27;t stop re-releasing the damn thing.
We can&#x27;t say for certain whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will ever be able to live up to such a legacy. In fact, we can&#x27;t even say for certain at what stage of development it&#x27;s currently at. But Bethesda&#x27;s next big RPG, Starfield, is due out in less than a month.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is the latest entry in the long-running RPG franchise. It represents a new direction for the series, and the game earned itself considerable critical acclaim upon release, scoring a 9 here on Destructoid. This hasn’t quite translated into financial success, at least according to the latest reports following the release of Square Enix’s first-quarter financial briefing.
Square Enix’s financial report reveals that although net sales are up thanks to the release of new titles such as Final Fantasy XVI, operating income is down partly due to amortization of development cost. According to Bloomberg, Square Enix President Takashi Kiryu told analysts on a post-earnings call that Final Fantasy XVI did not meet the high end of the company’s expectations.

                              <span>Those who have been paying attention to the gaming world these past few days won&#x27;t be surprised to learn that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is currently doing quite well for itself. In fact, when last checked, the game had hit a pretty big milestone, showing more than 800,000 concurrent players on Steam.
To get a bit more specific, according to SteamDB (a website that tracks and monitors all things related to the Steam client), the new Baldur&#x27;s Gate experienced a peak of 814,666 players within the last 24 hours.
https://youtu.be/XuCfkgaaa08
Bearing in mind, the game only came out last Thursday, so who knows whether this number could yet be beaten.
Take THAT, 97 other games
Going one step further, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is currently the third most-played game on Steam, just behind Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Given that these other titles were either developed or published by Valve, you can safely say that BG3 is the most non-Valve-played game at the moment.
Larian Studios&#x27; release had an impressive launch when it came out on August 3, scoring pretty big on PC. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s sitting pretty with a Metacritic score of 95 and a user score of 9.2.
It&#x27;s been nearly 23 years since the last major installment in the Baldur&#x27;s Gate series (though we&#x27;ve had expansions and enhanced editions), so fans of the previous games have no doubt been massively anticipating this third entry.
It&#x27;s hard to say whether this hype will continue, or whether we&#x27;re seeing its peak already. After all, Sons of the Forest was a major overnight success, selling two million copies in just one day. Now, you don&#x27;t really hear much from the co-op horror title. Then again, the Baldur&#x27;s Gate name is likely to carry more weight in the AAA scene.

Bungie is a fascinating case study, as they&#x27;ve managed to create one of the best-feeling shooters ever made, but haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to run a live service game for nearly nine years. Their recent &quot;State of the Game&quot; blog tests that theory once again.
Why are people so mad at the August 2023 Destiny 2 State of the Game blog?
In the aforementioned blog, Bungie essentially delivers their &quot;we&#x27;re listening, but not doing much about it.&quot; It&#x27;s a classic read-between-the-lines situation for the studio, which has struggled to keep up with player requests, basic quality-of-life additions, and everything in between.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Ahead of tomorrow&#x27;s Pokémon Presents, Alana is hoping that The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero is a real treasure for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet.

Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet’s DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, is a bit of a mystery at the moment. We know it’s split into two parts – The Teal Mask is due out this Fall, while The Indigo Disk follows in Winter – and we know the locations, a few characters, and some returning (and new) Pokémon. But even as someone who loved Scarlet &amp; Violet, despite its swathe of technical issues, this DLC has some real work to do if Game Freak is going to win back disheartened fans.

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it&#x27;ll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it&#x27;s still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer&#x27;s last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.</span>

                              <span>Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

                              <span>Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a &quot;Devolver Delayed Showcase&quot; to tell players all about the games they won&#x27;t be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
&quot;We have some exciting news about next year,&quot; one host says. &quot;This year&#x27;s delays,&quot; the other host follows up. &quot;Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!&quot;
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today&#x27;s delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it&#x27;s better to delay a game than to launch it before it&#x27;s ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.</span>

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it&#x27;s unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.</span>

                              <span>Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend&#x27;s Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn&#x27;t stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as &quot;a manaical poison aficionado,&quot; A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is popular right now. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is also pretty hot at the moment, especially with a new animated film out in theaters. That’s probably why Capcom is bringing the latter into the former in a fun-looking collaboration.
Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. 


Street FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.</span>

                              <span>Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. 
Set in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there&#x27;s no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today&#x27;s Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won&#x27;t go down without a fight. 
Check out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they&#x27;ll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a &quot;Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.&quot; Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. 
Binding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party&#x27;s power into a devastating blow. 

&quot;The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.&quot; 
Deathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.</span>

It features a more streamlined design that James called &quot;achingly close to perfection&quot;, with hybrid optical-mechanical switches and a slightly lower weight (89g) - plus the same high complement of programmable buttons and the hyper-advanced scroll wheel that made the G502 such a hit in the first place.

                              <span>New graphics card generations are a typical driving force behind gaming laptop refreshes, but CPUs can floor that pedal with just as heavy a boot. The result is often something like this latest Asus ROG Strix Scar 17, which wields not just a top-spec Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 but also one of AMD’s newest and most number-crunchy processors, the Ryzen 9 7945HX. 
That’s a lot of newness, and even more of a specs list: 32 threads from the Ryzen, 16GB of VRAM, DLSS 3 support and so on. And yet, what’s most impressive about the Strix Scar 17 is not simply its immense power, but how balanced – sensible, even – the whole laptop feels like in use. A quality that seems almost impossible at first, given its clear status as a brashly high-end gaming notebook with all the RGB bells and aggressive styling whistles.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s PS5 DualSense gamepad is one of the best controllers for PC, but with a $70 MSRP it&#x27;s also one of the most expensive mainstream options. Thankfully, DualSense price cuts that appeared first in the UK have now spread to the US, bringing the Sony pad to a reasonable $49. 
Given how well this controller is supported for PC gaming, thanks to the efforts of Valve and modders behind projects like DualSenseX, this makes it an awesome pickup - whether you&#x27;re looking to play Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 in couch co-op or F1 23 with full adaptive trigger support.

                              <span>PlatinumGames co-founder, Bayonetta director and celebrated Twitter shoutyman Hideki Kamiya would like the &quot;retro&quot; game label to go out of fashion. His argument is that calling something &quot;retro&quot; is inherently condescending - each game has its own particular achievements and qualities that deserve to be understood in terms of more than just nostalgia cultivated by a novelty-driven industry. After all, Johnny 90s Developer didn&#x27;t spend months knocking together a bespoke cover system or fancy artstyle so that you could badge it &quot;quaint&quot;, &quot;old school&quot; and so on, 30 years later. Assuming you can still access the game at all.
&quot;I don&#x27;t like the word &#x27;retro game&#x27;,&quot; Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. &quot;I&#x27;m obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I&#x27;m interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word &#x27;retro&#x27; from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a &#x27;fad&#x27; brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era.&quot;

I cracked a fresh save over the weekend, having bid a sad goodbye to my early access Tiefling rogue, and I already know what I’d like from the game’s modding scene, or preferably, a forthcoming official update. No, it isn’t new races, or increased party sizes, or the removal of the weight limit (which you can get around by offloading spare loot to your Tardis-esque interdimensional campsite). What I’d like most is the ability to switch between characters during dialogue. You’ll trigger many of these conversations without warning as you explore the world, and I routinely bumble into chitchats the character I’m controlling isn’t quite prepped for.

                              <span>As people of a certain age will know, the current, slow-moving death of Twitter is nothing we haven&#x27;t seen before. Most of us who were knocking around the internet in the early 00s will have at least one online gravestone in the closet somewhere, whether it&#x27;s a long abandoned LiveJournal or MySpace page, or an old internet forum that sadly doesn&#x27;t exist anymore (RPS in peace). But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that&#x27;s part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren&#x27;t equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who&#x27;s just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. 
As he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It&#x27;s a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone&#x27;s fun, and yes, there&#x27;s a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse&#x27;s source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that&#x27;s all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don&#x27;t cut it anymore.

                              <span>Super Replay returns, and we&#x27;re checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts! Join us today on Twitch at 2:30 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We&#x27;ll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). 
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare&#x27;s beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let&#x27;s find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360&#x27;s biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

                              <span>In 2017, Sonic Mania brought the series back to its 2D roots in a way not seen in decades. While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.
&quot;During Sonic Mania&#x27;s development, I didn&#x27;t expect this level of fan reaction or success,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;That success created the opportunity to think a…</span>

                              <span>Somerville is bringing its mysterious alien invasion to PlayStation consoles on August 31. The game comes from Jumpship, a studio formed by former Playdead (Limbo, Inside) CEO Dino Patti.
It centers on a small family rocked by a sudden alien invasion of Earth, who must now survive by running and hiding. The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.


Somerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.
For more on Somerville, you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Somerville review and editor Kyle Hilliard&#x27;s opinion piece on why it&#x27;s the best alien invasion game since Half-Life 2.</span>

                              <span>Immortals of Aveum is an upcoming action game that mixes a fantasy world and its magic with first-person shooting. We&#x27;ve played a chunk of it and enjoyed it – read our full hands-on preview thoughts here – but now, we&#x27;ve heard a track from the game&#x27;s score. And you can too because we can exclusively reveal that track today. 
It&#x27;s big, robust, and heroic, fitting if the full game is anything like what we&#x27;ve gone hands-on with. After listening to this track, we interviewed the game&#x27;s audio director Aubrey Hodges, composer Jamie K, and media composer Tom Hawk about the game&#x27;s score, how the team created a soundtrack that blends hip-hop with orchestral arrangements, and so much more.

It will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and run for roughly 35 minutes. The company announced this with a short teaser clip on the official Pokémon Twitter account, and you can watch that for yourself below:

As you can see, the teaser doesn&#x27;t reveal too much beyond details of when the Pokémon Presents is happening. However, near its start, there&#x27;s an interesting use of purple-pink and neon lighting. Perhaps it&#x27;s alluding to Mewtwo or Mew, or maybe to Ryme City from Pokémon Detective Pikachu, which features plenty of neon lighting in the movie. It could be an allu…</span>

                              <span>Look, I could justify this month&#x27;s Reality Bytes in any number of ways. I could say the VR launch cupboard is a little bare at the moment, with Steam&#x27;s New Releases list offering up a lot of dour military shooters, dubious Early Access projects, and fantasy dismemberment porn. I could say that The Room VR: A Dark Matter has just received a PSVR2 release, so now seems an opportune moment to revisit this acclaimed spin-off puzzler. I could say that The Room VR is the only entry in the series RPS hasn&#x27;t covered yet. But to be perfectly honest, I just fancied playing The Room VR. So there.


Oh all right, there was a slightly more specific reason why I wanted to revisit a game that came out just three days after Half-Life: Alyx. Upon its launch, there wasn&#x27;t much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn&#x27;t feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman&#x27;s Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I picked a game that irritated me quite so much. I quit playing Frank And Drake twice before even meeting its second protagonist, but something about it kept pulling me back.

It&#x27;s partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that&#x27;s unreal and very lifelike at once, and it&#x27;s sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not afraid to admit this, but it&#x27;s become increasingly obvious over the last few days of playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 that my ability to create interesting custom characters is severely lacking compared to other members of the RPS Treehouse. Case in point, our Ed breezily announced yesterday in our team Slack that he was playing as a Dark Urge bard called, wait for it, Edders Sheeran like it was no big deal whatsoever. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance. I mean, come on, it&#x27;s so good it should actually be illegal. 
But it also confirmed to me a deep dark truth about myself that I think I knew deep down, but had kinda been pushing under my equally drab mental carpet for years and years. I&#x27;m quite boring at the end of the day, and am the type of person who, no matter the game, always creates basically the same identical person every single time.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not usually one for character creators. I don&#x27;t like squinting at brow density or sliding the juiciness of my lips down a scale, twisting and turning my character as if it really and truly matters when I drown them in chainmail anyway. But getting my fella right for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 was of utmost importance, as they&#x27;d be my 100+ hour vessel for awful, awful decisions. And I&#x27;ve started off strong, having created an awful little guy.
Let me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.

Akechi and Kisume stans might notice they aren’t in the shenanigans below, but that&#x27;s because both characters have been sadly paywalled behind day-one DLC. For now, check out the new trailer.

This is not something the game discourages. In fact, I would say that Larian&#x27;s Dungeons-&amp;-Dragons-but-digital game actively encourages it. Both Edders and Graham found out that you can die almost immediately upon finishing the tutorial and encountering a dying bit of ocotopus sashimi in a crashed ship; fail a roll involved in talking to this unfortunate mind flayer and that&#x27;s it. Kaput, in about an hour. As Graham observed, the lesson that this teaches you is not &quot;mind flayers are dangerous&quot;, because you have already learned this lesson on account of the opening cutscene being all about that. The lesson is &quot;the DM is a prick, so savescum often&quot;.

Previously, it was planned for a late August timeframe. Since the full game and the upcoming beta support crossplay, developers Nexon say the delay will help to optimise the game on all platforms. So you can loop laser rope threads with buddies on consoles, no problem.

                              <span>Following in the footsteps of its older sibling, a remaster for seminal shooter sequel Quake 2 will reportedly get an official announcement at next week’s QuakeCon 2023, which is an in-person event for the first time since the pandemic era. Earlier in the year, Quake 2’s remaster accidentally poked its head out in a ratings board leak, but let’s all pretend to be surprised when Bethesda announces it next week, okay?

It&#x27;s only at EGX that you can play games you control with a lamp, or a brick, or with a real morse code tapper. All of those and more were present at the RPS Future Of Play booth at EGX 2022, a curated collection of alternative controllers.

We&#x27;re bringing it back again this year and this time we&#x27;re inviting developers to submit their work for inclusion. Do you have a custom controller and one-of-a-kind video game you want to show to the world? Read on.

                              <span>Liam and I have been playing looter shooter Remnant 2 in our spare time, as we realised we both couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it. Having been burned out of Destiny 2 and most live service games, we discovered Remnant 2 delivers all the benefits of blasting gangly creatures for skill points without all the live service baggage. What a refreshing thing.
Thing is, if two out of the three major bosses we&#x27;ve faced so far took us to court for cheesing them, we&#x27;d lose. And it brings us no greater pleasure, knowing we&#x27;ve carved powerful new weapons out of their remains. God, it feels good to be totally undeserving of any credit whatsoever.

                              <span>Multiplayer survival sandbox Scum has dropped its 0.9 Smokin’ Hot update today to add more of the expected guns, monsters, and balance tweaks. But the update’s called Smokin’ Hot because it makes all the guys in the game, well, smokin’ hot - if you&#x27;re into men with a Gears Of War workout routine, that is. Following the revamped female character models last year, developer Gamepires continue their early access tour with a refresh for every male character in the game which may or may not include a touch up for the Danny Trejo DLC skin. Take a look at the new beefcakes and beefy mutants below.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 came out earlier this evening. It couldn&#x27;t be pre-loaded before launch and having already installed the Early Access version wasn&#x27;t an alternative, which means a lot of people were trying to download the 122GB RPG at the same time.

Steam held up to the onslaught - mostly.

                              <span>Dave The Diver is an unusual mixture of deep sea exploration, sushi restaurant management, and a thousand other ideas. It&#x27;s also been a smash hit since its release from early access in June. 

In a new update video from developers Mintrocket, they seem as surprised by its huge success as anyone, while also outlining their roadmap for coming quality-of-life updates.

                              <span>Studios like Rockstar can capture the essence of New York in a video game, but New York is a city full of famous landmarks. SCS Software, by comparison, have become masters at capturing the essence of places of no significance. The long freeway, the vacant parking lot, the anonymous storage warehouse, the nowhere town; all are rendered with such care and detail in American Truck Simulator that they become as compelling to me as any virtual Times Square.

The latest example: Oklahoma, now available in ATS&#x27;s latest DLC. Watch the launch trailer below and see if it doesn&#x27;t make you want to take a road trip.

                              <span>It is once more that time of year when the searing heat drives us underground, to subsist on raw snacks, re-read The Book Of Phoenix, and play this year&#x27;s Low-Intensity Strategy Game For When It&#x27;s Actually Refreshingly Temperate And Rainy Out But We&#x27;re Committed To The Bit Now.
Myriads Colon Renaissance is not quite the break from the 4X that I&#x27;d tried to get us, but it is a hybrid. You build up a city, explore and conquer new lands, unlock research and ultimately push everyone&#x27;s faces in, but its other main pillar is tower defence, a genre I very rarely align with. Which is a good sign, right? Two good reasons not to choose it, but I am anyway.

                              <span>How does one make a sequel to a basically perfect game? 2007&#x27;s physics-platformer-in-a-weird-science-facility Portal is a lodestar piece of game design from top to bottom. It&#x27;s one of my favourite games, and I went into 2011&#x27;s Portal 2 with many a reservation. But it&#x27;s very good! And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it&#x27;s quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.
I could do &quot;the joy of Portal 2&#x27;s retro science&quot;, where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do &quot;the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2&quot;, a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do &quot;the joy of potatoes in Portal 2&quot;. And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant&#x27;s character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).

                              <span>There&#x27;s always been quite a disconnect between Revenant&#x27;s reputation and his abilities in Apex Legends. All the cinematics we get of this infamous, terrifying murder-bot show him single-mindedly pursuing his targets, scuttling along walls, and wiping out enemies at close range like a cybernetic John Wick. But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.
Season 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.

That&#x27;s because he only shows up if you pick Lae&#x27;zel as your origin character, because who else would be there to do her fancy sword lunge from above if not a gender-swapped version of basically herself? But he&#x27;s a good egg, Losiir, even if his run-time as an official Baldur&#x27;s Gate companion is, err, somewhat short-lived.

That&#x27;s an awesome price for one of the very fastest SSDs on the market, one that&#x27;s on par with our favourite favourite PCIe 4.0 SSD for gaming, the Samsung 980 Pro and WD SN850. Normally we&#x27;d expect to pay closer to £160 for this model, making it a solid £30+ savings.

                              <span>Update, and a rather important one at that: The crashing issues I’ve had with Baldur’s Gate 3 on the Steam Deck have been, as far as I can tell, fully fixed. No more collapsing back to the Steam library on startup, and no forcing the use of Proton Experimental – it should launch and work straight away. Valve have even upgraded Baldur’s Gate 3 from Playable to Verified for Steam Deck play, reflecting its newfound handheld-readiness.
This means you can safely ignore the first part of this article, where I whinge about software instability as if it’s the the most heinous atrocity humankind has ever inflicted on itself. All the stuff on general performance, settings, and battery life still applies.

The game has been locked on subscription service Apple Arcade since 2021, but that might change soon. Maybe. Hopefully. That&#x27;s according to an apparent listing for the game on SteamDB, suggesting that a PC port could be on the table.

I would say it&#x27;s been an unusually busy year, but then again, it&#x27;s always a busy year, so I really have no excuse. Sorry about that. But! After some much appreciated feedback on how I can improve these Letters From The Editor, I return to you today with some notes and thoughts about how we&#x27;re going to cover Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. I&#x27;ll tell you now, it&#x27;s going to be a while before you see our review, as review code only arrived a couple of days ago.

                              <span>In the run-up to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 leaving early access, developers Larian Studios have understandably put a lot of emphasis on the game&#x27;s custom character creation, what with it being much more firmly ingrained in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and role-playing more generally than, say, their previous Divinity games. But before you jump into creating your favourite D&amp;D build, do take a moment to watch the Introductions for each of its fixed origin characters, too. They&#x27;re great fun, well-written and have some good jokes in them, but they also reveal some important details about your companions-to-be that you might not have gleaned otherwise. They&#x27;re also very easy to miss if you&#x27;re not careful.

James and I, and a lot of other folk at RPS, are all learning the importance of rolling for initiative this week, because we&#x27;re playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3! Larian&#x27;s take on what is essentially the official cRPG version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition is out of early access today and boy, is it a doozy. So we answer your questions and Nates, and talk about animal forms and rolling for initiative and why the DM is a git. Plus, James has been struggling to get the game working on Steam Deck. Sometimes it does!

                              <span>If you’ve been resisting Baldur’s Gate 3’s early access run to save yourself for the full release, there’s good news for both of us: you can fill your knowledge boots with this guide to the launch build’s PC performance and best settings, and I get to avoid feeling like I’m just giving advice to people who’ve been playing this gigantic RPG for two years longer than me. Hell yeah.

                              <span>The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.
Upon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.

                              <span>Portal 2 is obviously brilliant, in part because each of its chapters possesses a distinct charm. GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the &#x27;true&#x27; puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.

                              <span>Diablo 4 is walking back several changes from its big Season 1 patch which had made the game an even bigger slog and proved to be overwhelmingly controversial with fans. Blizzard had previously spoken about the upcoming 1.1.1 plaster update during a developer livestream, but the new patch notes detail everything we can expect, including crucial fixes, tweaks to mounts, and big buffs for the Sorcerer and Barbarian classes. The patch drops on August 8th.

                              <span>I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve recommended people play Return Of The Obra Dinn. It&#x27;s the one game I&#x27;m confident recommending to anyone to folks who play games frequently, but also to those who don&#x27;t. My biggest triumph was recommending it to my dad, a 62-year-old retired manufacturing manager from Wales, who loved it so much he not only recommended it to a friend (who also loved it) but also said my mum should try it too - and I agree! It’s all subjective of course, but for me, its banger of a story, accessible it is, and how you can practically run it on a potato make it a wonderful gateway into gaming in general.

One older model that sits on top of a bunch of monitors is the C720, an HD webcam that normally retails for $25. Today though, a $5 coupon on Amazon brings this webcam down to $13 and change, making it a sensible pickup for anyone that needs a webcam for streaming or video calls.

                              <span>Return Of The Obra Dinn is, quite rightly, one of the greatest video games of all time. It&#x27;s certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year&#x27;s RPS 100 has proven, it&#x27;s also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship&#x27;s wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. 
There are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it&#x27;s also one of those games I can&#x27;t play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It&#x27;s only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope&#x27;s nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there&#x27;s one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can&#x27;t erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I&#x27;m talking about the shoe and hammock revelation.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors&#x27; snazzy new engine upgrade is coming this month, but developers Poncle seem to be cooking up something even more exciting for their dopamine-fuel bullet heaven shooter. Vampire Survivors: Directer’s Cut is supposedly a major overhaul to the smash hit roguelike, although it unfortunately “may or may not” ever be released.

                              <span>In an extraordinary filing at an Illinois court this week, a pirate IPTV-related lawsuit filed by DISH Network last year was slammed by hosting company defendant, DataCamp. After informing the court DISH has no standing to sue in a copyright case, DataCamp claimed that DISH tried to force the company into an agreement to create a &#x27;False Public Judgment&#x27; for tens of millions of dollars. That document would be used to &quot;terrorize&quot; other hosting companies, DataCamp said.

                              <span>Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.
It’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. 
A spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: 
“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”
Striking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. 
The Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.

                              <span>Activision is teasing a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare-related reveal next week. 
This lighthearted tease, which you can see below, hints that the next Call of Duty is another Modern Warfare, even though 2022’s Call of Duty was Modern Warfare II. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). 
Jokes on you, real key art here.

As you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” 
It seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. 
In the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that.

With Charizard serving as the figurehead Pokémon for this expansion, it&#x27;s sure to be a popular release given that particular Pocket Monster&#x27;s history with the TCG. 
This expansion continues building on the Scarlet and Violet games with even more Paldean species but also adds type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex. This mechanic recalls the Delta Species mechanic from the early 2000s, where the strongest form of a Pokémon could be of a different type than its evolutionary chain. However, type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex actually make sense within the context of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, as Tera Pokémon often change types when they Terastallize.

Sonic Superstars takes us back to the 2D era of the franchise, where the gameplay is more straightforward, the story premises are simpler, and the character roster is small. That&#x27;s certainly the case for the playable roster, featuring just Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, but it&#x27;s also true for the villain roster. Sonic Superstars sees the return of Dr. Eggman, as well as Fang the Hunter (previously known as Nack the Weasel and Fang the Sniper) from Sonic Triple Trouble and Sonic the Fighters, but they&#x27;re not alone.

Life sims can be great stress relievers by letting you build a digital life from the ground up at a leisurely pace. However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO. While much of it feels familiar, the promise of building a home alongside friends while unraveling a central mystery is enticing for the genre.

Head here to read Game Informer&#x27;s Gollum review. However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is targeting many of those problems in the game’s PC version with a new patch that’s now live. 
Daedalic published an extensive list of changes for the PC version on the Gollum Steam page. It’s unclear if any of these changes are coming to the game’s console versions, but Game Informer reached out to Daedalic to ask and will update this story if it hears back. As for the PC patch, it includes changes that fix issues with quest markers disappearing, interactable objects becoming non-interactable, checkpoint system bugs, and much more.

                              <span>Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.
He did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. 


“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. 
Fallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” 
While waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that.

                              <span>9anime.to, one of the world&#x27;s largest piracy sites, has suddenly rebranded to Aniwave.to. The unexpected change comes as a surprise to the streaming portal&#x27;s millions of users. According to the operators, the switch is motivated by site-blocking efforts and DMCA issues, but could there be more to the story?

                              <span>Acer&#x27;s Nitro lineup of monitors have proven reliable in my estimation, with a unit I bought in 2019 still being used daily in 2023. There&#x27;s another Nitro model discounted on Amazon US today, the XV271U. This newer Nitro model comes with a 27-inch span, 2560x1440 resolution and 180Hz refresh rate. That, combined with G-Sync/FreeSync support and a solid Fast IPS panel, make for an awesome monitor - especially at $200, following a $100 discount.

                              <span>I feel a little bad for the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D. This 12-core 3D V-Cache processor sits in the middle of the 8-core Ryzen 7 7800X3D (that ranks as the fastest gaming processor) and the 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X3D (that combines excellent gaming and content creation performance). 
However, being overshadowed by your siblings is no bad thing, as the 7900X3D has fallen significantly further in price, bringing it back into contention for users that want a lot of cores for content creation tasks and excellent gaming performance. It launched at $600 and now retails for $510, but today on Ebay you can get this processor for just $439 - an amazing price. You even get a free copy of Starfield in the bargain.

                              <span>&quot;We don&#x27;t go to Ravenholm…&quot; Half-Life 2&#x27;s sixth chapter heading warns, and when you arrive at the outskirts of this abandoned mining town, you immediately see why. This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren&#x27;t enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can&#x27;t be worse than what&#x27;s in front of you. 
But I&#x27;d also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: &quot;We don&#x27;t go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.&quot; This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be.

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 is right around the corner - comes out tomorrow, August 3rd - and everything we’ve learned about the mammoth RPG makes it sounds like an awfully horny romp. Of course, there’s the recently revealed hot villainess that had an entire corner of the internet making the same joke: “I can fix her.” There’s the fact that you can seduce a druid who’s in bear form - as in an actual bear, not the gay slang version of the word. And now, the voice actor behind Baldur’s Gate 3’s narrator has posted several outtakes, giving us gems such as “I’m a bard, I can fuck my way through any problem.” Have a listen here.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve been immensely enjoying the seeming renaissance of tower defence citybuilding games recently. The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there&#x27;s something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, &#x27;Yes, more of this, please&#x27;. It&#x27;s the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there&#x27;s a new kid that&#x27;s ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. 
Thronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It&#x27;s only just come out in early access today, but I&#x27;ve been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level.

                              <span>Multiplayer peekaboo game Dead By Daylight has added countless horror movie icons to its roster of playable villains and survivors in recent months. Behaviour Interactive have already steamrolled through recognisable faces such as Ghostface, Freddy Kreuger, Leatherface, Micheal Myers, and, err, Nic Cage. But the next collaboration takes the scares to outer space since the Xenomorph (the Alien from Alien) is coming to the game. Here’s a brief teaser.

                              <span>Upcoming tactical CRPG Dark Envoy caught my attention when it was announced last year, mainly because it has the undeniably cool combo of high fantasy magic and steampunk firearms. Casting you as a refugee adventurer, you’ll be shooting and/or spell-flinging across the war-ravaged world of Jäan, and you can even bring a friend along for the ride in co-op. We already knew all that good stuff, but the developers have now released a new video that delves deeper into the game’s classes and specialisations. Take a look below.

                              <span>Civil Protection officers are shorter than I thought they’d be. Don’t get me wrong, I&#x27;m very much a Short King myself, but I assumed the gas mask-wearing enforcers of City 17 would be more vertically intimidating. As I defiantly refuse to pick up litter in Half-Life 2’s opening sequence, I find the approaching officer and his raised electric baton to be weirdly adorable. Until he hits me, of course. The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.
This has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity. I spend the majority of my time leaning in really close to walls and muttering, “That’s interesting,” before a leaping headcrab shocks me so severely that I damage some more furniture and scare the cat.

                              <span>If you own Half-Life 2 but never bothered with its freebie tech demo, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, do give it a whirl. Its showcase of HDR lighting might have lost the &quot;Huh, nice&quot; factor it had in 2005, but it’s still a satisfying slice of punchy HL2 combat, with a nod to the original Half-Life that Valve regretted not making in the main game. I know this because Valve told me, via Lost Coast&#x27;s other innovation: its developer commentary.
I love these things, these spinning speech bubbles inflated with knowledge straight from the FPS coalface. So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since. They’re interesting and illuminating, don’t interfere with the game unless the player wants them to, and help build design literacy. Why, then, don’t more games offer commentary as well?

                              <span>Developers Alkemi Games made quite the impression with their lush card-battler Foretales, but they’re now pivoting into the roguelike action realm with An Ankou. The game’s explore-a-craft-y-slasher mix gives it some flavour from Hades and V Rising, only this time with a shadowy French-folklore skin attached. An Ankou hits early access on August 17th, and I’m very excited to juggle it alongside the zillion other games dropping this month.

                              <span>When I was a kid growing up in rural New Mexico, I dreaded the first day of school. I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I&#x27;d need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn&#x27;t manage to come to school with. 
That&#x27;s why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that&#x27;s one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you&#x27;re considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor. 

Get the LG 27GR95QE 27-inch 240Hz 1440p OLED gaming monitor for $718 w/ code SAVE4SCHOOL (was $999)

                              <span>For a few evenings last year, a friend and I had fun playing escape room puzzler Escape Simulator. He&#x27;s smarter than I am, which was a boon because we were playing coopratively. It might be less beneficial now, since Pine Studio have just released Escape Simulator&#x27;s &quot;Versus Update&quot;. It lets you race to solve escape room puzzles competitively, with a new &quot;truly challenging room that takes place on a quiz show from the &#x27;80s.&quot;

                              <span>Ugreen is a Chinese brand that has made a name for itself by providing surprisingly good design and build quality with the same aggressive pricing as its domestic competitors. I&#x27;ve used one of their USB-C chargers before, but I wish I&#x27;d bought this 4-port Gallium Nitride (GaN) charger that offers three USB-C ports, one USB-A port and a maximum output of 100W - sufficient for many lighter laptops, but more importantly the Steam Deck, mobile phones, tablets, headphones and controllers. This normally costs £50, but today it&#x27;s down to £42 to Scan in the UK.

                              <span>I have an affection for &#x27;90s first-person shooter Sin I suspect the game doesn&#x27;t deserve, because it had a handful of good guns, ATMs you could press the buttons on, and a fight on the rooftop of a train. I am therefore always interested in each seemingly cursed attempt to revive the series.

The latest is Sin: Reloaded, from frequent remaster crew Night Dive Studios. Announced back in 2020 without an update since, Night Dive now say that the project &quot;isn&#x27;t dead&quot; but will be tackled &quot;at a later date.&quot;

                              <span>Update: Larian Studios have now posted a detailed guide on how to prepare for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s launch. The Steam blog says that early access saves and profiles &quot;aren&#x27;t compatible with the release version... and leaving them in your save folders may in some fringe cases cause issues.&quot;

Original Story: Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is mere days away, and you may be wondering if you can prep in some way for the epic RPG&#x27;s release. You can, it turns out: not by pre-loading its 122GB download size on Steam, no, but by deleting your Early Access saves and uninstalling the game entirely.

This is available only on the white model, which I happen to think looks great - and this is really an outstanding price for a sit/stand price of this size (47.2 x 23.6 inches, for the record).

Scrolling through all the good stuff might take a while since nearly 250 games are discounted, so let’s run through some highlights here.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper is a game with lots of brilliant individual stories in it, even the ones that end so catastrophically badly that redemption seems nigh on impossible. But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn&#x27;t one of Citizen Sleeper&#x27;s more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it&#x27;s one of the game&#x27;s quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it&#x27;s there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.

August begins with venerated A Short Hike, which crosses paths with fellow hiker Death Stranding on its way off the Game Pass mega mountain.

                              <span>I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, &quot;Crap. Chaos is coming, and there&#x27;s nothing I can do to stop it.&quot; It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn&#x27;t quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I&#x27;d let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game&#x27;s &#x27;good&#x27; ending really mattered to me back then.
It was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, &#x27;You know what? If we&#x27;re going no-kill, let&#x27;s Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.&#x27; A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh&#x27;s Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you&#x27;d also be totally and utterly wrong.

                              <span>Dishonored 2 is an immersive sim stealth &#x27;em up by Arkane and it&#x27;s been in my brain a lot more than usual. Partly due to this year&#x27;s RPS 100, but also because of the mess that was Redfall. Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there&#x27;s definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with being hopeful.
I think of Dishonored 2&#x27;s A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane&#x27;s past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present. While I can&#x27;t look into the future, I still think there&#x27;s worth in turning to an all-time classic of a stealth level.

I’m tempted to lead my country to ruin all over again.

                              <span>The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I&#x27;ve started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there&#x27;s just something about it that can&#x27;t quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.
The Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer&#x27;s Paradox, over the weekend. As you&#x27;d perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable &#x27;so and so will remember that&#x27; choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can&#x27;t help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that&#x27;s not just because you&#x27;re floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show.

                              <span>Four years ago, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 was announced with a trailer that showed how a human could succumb to the small illithid tadpole stuck inside his noggin, thus becoming a mind flayer. The process begins with excruciating headaches, escalates to fingers twisting by themselves, and culminates with an octopus head spouting out of the body. That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites &quot;tie into&quot; its RPG systems. Yep, you can choose to either embrace or resist the tempting corruption, with the former giving you some pretty cool party tricks, while the latter means you won’t be subjected to David Cronenberg-esque body horror. Tough decision, I think.

                              <span>Ubisoft has revealed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope: Rayman in the Phantom Show, the final announced DLC coming to the Nintendo mashup strategy game that hit Switch last October. 
Shortly after the release of Sparks of Hope last year, Ubisoft announced it had three DLCs planned for the game. The first was The Tower of Doooom, which hit the game this March. Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. 
You can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: 


“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” 
When Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. 
Sparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30.

                              <span>Mountaintop Studios has released the first teaser for its in-development competitive shooter inspired by anime, manga, and comics. 
Mountaintop Studios is a relatively new studio formed in 2020 by Nate Mitchell, a co-founder of Oculus. Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. 
While its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. 
“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.
&quot;The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” 

We’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer.

                              <span>Microsoft has revealed a new Stormcloud Vapor special edition Xbox Series X/S controller, and it looks great.
The Xbox maker announced the controller in a blog post, revealing that the controller is available for preorder starting today. It will cost $69.99 and you can purchase it from Xbox’s online store, Microsoft stores, and some local retailers. The controller is onyx blue, with a smoky aesthetic that gives the controller a unique look in the lineup of Xbox Series X/S controllers. 
Microsoft says the design is inspired by clouds and storming skies, “with each billowing puff of vapor bringing a unique design to each controller,” hence the Stormcloud Vapor name. It features rubberized, blue diamond-pattern grips and can hook up to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles, PC, mobile phones, and tablets. 
Purchasing this controller also gives you a unique Stormcloud Vapor dynamic background that you can check out in motion in the video below:

                              <span>Jujutsu Kaisen is the latest anime to crossover with Epic Games’ free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account officially announced this crossover today with a quick teaser video showcasing some original characters making shadow puppets on a wall in the battle island’s Mega City locale. Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. 
You can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:


Fortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. 
As for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. 
Fortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars&#x27; Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan.

For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What is the biggest improvement or new feature you&#x27;d like to see in the next Nintendo console?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. 
VGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). 


The publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. 
VGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.
In February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. 
Regardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product.

                              <span>NetherRealm Studios has released a new Mortal Kombat 1 trailer focused on the Keepers of Time and Geras, a Mortal Kombat 11 debut character returning as a playable fighter. 
The Mortal Kombat studio has released a steady flow of trailers and gameplay since its MK1 reveal back in May, and that continued over the weekend with a new showcase on the Keepers of Time faction and sand-wielding warrior Geras. In it, we get new looks at Liu Kang, including a new fatality for him, and Geras. 
You can check out the MK1 Keepers of Time trailer for yourself below: 


Over the weekend, MK1 director Ed Boon tweeted an image with what many think might be a new character debuting in the game. Boon writes, “New phone. Who dis?” and circles the unknown character, leading many to believe it’s a tease of a new fighter.

Editor&#x27;s Note: This story previously stated that two new Mortal Kombat 1 trailers were released over the weekend and linked to a Geras trailer for Mortal Kombat 11. It has been updated to reflect that only one trailer was released – the Keepers of Time trailer – which reveals Geras as a playable fighter.</span>

                              <span>Sony has revealed a new PlayStation 5 system software beta rolling out today that brings the highly requested audio format, Dolby Atmos, to the console alongside a larger SSD capacity, accessibility features, and more. 
Since the launch of the PS5, audiophiles have asked for Dolby Atmos audio support on the console. Without diving too deep into the nitty gritty, Dolby Atmos is one of the best audio formats when adequately supported. While the PS5’s 3D Tempest audio tech is impressive, players have also wished for Dolby Atmos support. And now, with the latest system software beta, it has arrived. 


“3D Audio powered by Tempest 3D AudioTech can now be enjoyed by those who own compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled HDMI devices such as soundbars, TVs, or home theater systems,” a PlayStation Blog pos…</span>

                              <span>A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 &amp; Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!

                              <span>UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky has reportedly obtained a High Court injunction that will compel internet service providers to block access to live pirated sports streams, including both football and cricket matches. A novel aspect of the injunction is that it grants Sky the ability to protect specific content, such as a major TV show, by blocking certain piracy services at certain times. Precise details are confidential but it&#x27;s not too difficult to arrive at a credible theory.

“To clarify, comments that suggest Transformers games have been lost were made in error. We apologize to Activision and regret any confusion; they’ve been great partners, and we look forward to future opportunities to work together.”
Original story: Transformers owners Hasbro have said they would like to see older video games based on the beloved toy franchise to make a return - except those games are lost somewhere on a hard drive inside Activision.

The FAQ section states the team feels &quot;very confident in getting everything into the game by April 2025.&quot; I&#x27;ll have the rat-rat-rat-tan chant stuck in my head until then.


Original Story: Patapon’s beloved blend of rhythm and strategy has been sadly relegated to PlayStation consoles, but a new spiritual successor is bringing that cutesy charm to PC as long as the game finds success on Kickstarter. Ratatan was announced at this year’s Bitsummit, and it’s coming from developer Ratata Arts who are led by developers who worked on the original Patapon series. The newest trailer (below) shows off the game’s adorable singing soldiers. Take a look.

                              <span>As a massive foodie with a near bottomless appetite, it pained me to watch Venba’s mouth-watering cooking puzzles knowing a similarly tasty-looking treat wasn’t waiting for me in real life. But as a second-generation immigrant, the game’s explorations of that experience hit so surprisingly close to home that I wasn’t left hungry by the time credits rolled. Venba is a touching, smart, and soulful game that made me want to hug everyone in my family immediately. Though, I do wish the game would’ve marinated in its good ideas a while longer.

                              <span>What lies beyond Limgrave? I honestly don’t know. I’ve muddled my way through Elden Ring’s starting peninsula three times now, but have yet to step foot beyond the crumbling gatehouse of Stormveil Castle. The second Godrick The Grafted is reduced to a sickly pile of wobbly limbs, I turn the game off and walk away.
It’s not that I don’t like Elden Ring. I’m not struggling to connect with its open world take on the Souls genre. I’m not put off by the difficult encounters that await me, or the obtuse challenges I’ll be forced to overcome. The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat constantly tries to one-up itself with increasingly bloody fatalities, as the series has gone from simple spine-ripping moves to finishers that incorporate hellish portals or a hungry dragon. Mortal Kombat 1’s latest trailer takes things one step further with really outlandish (and kinda fun) fatalities. It also confirms that Geras is joining the roster. Take a look below, but be warned: it’s gory, of course.

It appears to exist in a strange parallel universe where normal rules don&#x27;t appear to apply.

As an omnipresent robotic voice condescendingly wishes my team luck, my eyes widen in disbelief as a massive portal materializes over a city block. It spews hundreds of raptors that rain from the sky, tumbling down buildings before they sprint in our direction. It’s a jaw-dropping sight, but that awe turns to intimidation at the staggering number of adversaries thirsty for our blood. Our tank units move forward and activate their shields to create a defensive wall. A healer fills health bars to the brim. A sniper tak…</span>

Square Enix revealed this 7.0 expansion that acts as a new beginning for Final Fantasy XIV with a new cinematic trailer. After the trailer, director Naoki Yoshida took to the main stage to host a keynote presentation, and it was during this that we learned a lot about the Dawntrail expansion, which will hit the game sometime in summer 2024. Let&#x27;s break it all down.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S next spring. 
Xbox head Phil Spencer joined Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida on stage today, during Day 1 of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023, to reveal the news.
Here&#x27;s what Spencer had to say:
Spencer says this is a seminal moment &quot;in our relationship with you and the Final Fantasy team as we look to partner more closely together in the future,&quot; perhaps teasing more Final Fantasy to come to Xbox down the line. 
While the game will be playable on both Xbox Series X and Series S, Yoshida says only the Series X version will support 4K resolution. The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. 
This means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over.

Sonic Superstars aims to give players an experience loyal to those initial Classic Sonic entries on the Genesis. However, unlike past games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, which relied heavily on fan-favorite zones from previous games, Sonic Superstars forges its own path within the Classic Sonic series, delivering all-new stages that still deliver that Classic Sonic feel.
&quot;Well-known stages like Green Hill have made return appearances in many games, but that’s because it was necessary from a story point of view,&quot; Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. &quot;This t…</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV publisher Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have revealed Dawntrail, the MMO’s next expansion, and it hits the game next summer. 
Square Enix revealed Dawtrail today, the first day of Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023 in Las Vegas, with a new trailer showcasing the tropical New World known as Yok Tural and many beloved characters hanging out there. Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. 
Check out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: 


Yoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:
 














	


  
    

  
      
            


      
  










Speaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. 
“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”

                              <span>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. 
Sony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. 


That’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it&#x27;s exclusive to PSVR2.
However, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.


SEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it:

                              <span>The Entropy Centre is now available on Switch, and you can pick it up from the Nintendo eShop for 50% off, thanks to a special launch day discount. 
If you like a good puzzle game, especially if you’re a fan of Valve’s Portal series, The Entropy Centre is worth your time. It was one of my favorite games of last year, and you can read about why in my review of The Entropy Centre. With today’s launch day discount on the Nintendo eShop, you can purchase The Entropy Centre for $12.49. 
Check out the Nintendo Switch launch trailer for The Entropy Centre below: 


The Switch version of The Entropy Centre arrives less than a year after the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC versions launched last November. In the game, players take on the role of protagonist Aria, who awakens inside a colossal space station just outside of a constantly exploding Earth. It’s up to you to figure out why this space station – The Entropy Centre – has been abandoned, why Earth keeps exploding, and why your day resets afterward. You’ll do all this alongside Astra, a talking gun with a great sense of humor.

                              <span>Developer Hexworks and publisher GI Games have released a new extended gameplay presentation for Lords of the Fallen with nearly 20 minutes of new footage. 
Lords of the Fallen hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this October, and ahead of the game’s release, Hexworks and CI Games are pulling back the curtain on its dark fantasy world and action RPG combat. In the gameplay presentation, we get a new look at the living realm known as Axiom, where players must traverse harsh and gothic environments to defeat Adyr, the Demon God. However, Axiom isn’t the only concern, as players must also fight through Umbral, the realm of the dead.

                              <span>Adibou, the first game in the beloved children&#x27;s series, is now ready for public testing!
Also known as Adi Jr.&#x27;s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.
Many of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou&#x27;s first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he&#x27;s remembered for being in later games.
ScummVM supports all of the game&#x27;s releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.
As much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!
