                              <span>Dead Cells update shows some love to the game&#x27;s peers yet again
Dead Cells is one of the most renowned indie games of the past few years, and it&#x27;s part of a larger wave of really awesome roguelike games we&#x27;ve seen. Now, as yet another homage to beloved indie games, a free Dead Cells update is available that includes in-game goodies inspired by titles like Terraria, Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Slay the Spire, Risk of Rain 2, and Katana Zero. It&#x27;s known as Everyone Is Here Vol. II, and the update includes new lore rooms based on the featured games, in which players will find related weapons and armor they can use in their next Dead Cells run.
The theming doesn&#x27;t just stop at being able to wear costumes or don weapons from those games -- the effects and animations for actions like attacking…</span>

Zombie Hunter looks like a fake game. You know the opening of No More Heroes III where Travis Touchdown outlines this weird Deathman game, and the gamer part of your brain tells you that such a game couldn’t exist in the time period it’s supposedly from? That’s Zombie Hunter. It tells me it’s from 1987, but doesn’t really tell me it was developed by Lenar. Instead, it just mentions Hi-Score Media Work Corp, which was sued out of existence by Enix over a screenshot of Dragon Quest 2. I know this, because the first thing the game does upon being started is scream at you, “Hai Sukoa!” It was a nice jumpscare to start the game.

That&#x27;s a lot of UI
Just look at it. Half of the screen in Zombie Hunter is taken up by its HUD. It’s excessive! Then you actually start mo…</span>

As the Ghostrunner community eagerly awaits news of the cyberpunk hack &#x27;n&#x27; slasher&#x27;s upcoming sequel, publisher 505 Games has decided to throw them a bone in the form of some Ghostrunner 2 concept art — depicting the hi-tech towers awaiting Jack&#x27;s next bout of high-speed slice &#x27;n&#x27; dice action.
The new art was revealed as part of a special live stream this weekend, which you can watch right here.

Currently in development at Polish studio One More Level, Ghostrunner 2 was first announced way back in May 2021, though very little has been revealed of the project to date — with plot details, locales, and mechanics still under wraps. One can only assume that the developer will stick with what brought it to the dance, offering highly adrenalized action, wanton violence, and…</span>

This weekend saw the official reveal of the next hero headed to Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s shooter sequel Overwatch 2, but while the incoming Omnic Ramattra might have taken some of the community by surprise, (given the persisting rumor that Mauga would be next), some die-hard fans are sat with itchy trigger fingers waiting on the arrival of the mysterious mech maiden, D.Mon.
D.Mon, as OW lore fans will realize, is a member of South Korea&#x27;s Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army — more commonly known by the acronym &quot;MEKA&quot;. The MEKA is a party of highly skilled operatives who assist the government with various tasks, ranging from global defense to search-and-rescue operations. Encased in finely tuned, state-of-the-art mech units, MEKA are single-person assault vehicles, …</span>

                              <span>&quot;We’ve noticed a notable number of PS5 players playing the PS4 version of Destiny 2 on their current-generation consoles&quot;
When the current generation rolled out, Microsoft touted a concept called &quot;Smart Delivery.&quot; While some laughed at the idea of rolling out the red carpet for something that seems so obvious, Sony figured out a way to make version parity more confusing. Now developers, Bungie included, are stepping in to make sure that PlayStation players specifically are playing the right version of Destiny 2.
Over on their weekly blog, Bungie provided the following statement for PS5 owners:
&quot;Heads up, PlayStation Guardians. We’ve noticed a notable number of PS5 players playing the PS4 version of Destiny 2 on their current-generation consoles. For the optimal experience for PlayStation goodness, make sure to check out this resource here to upgrade to the free PS5 version to see an improvement in framerates and graphics overall.&quot;

That resource actually goes straight to a Sony FAQ page, which explains the difference between selecting the &quot;PS4 version&quot; and &quot;PS5 version&quot; of games that ostensibly have cross-generational delivery. If you haven&#x27;t done it before, it involves going to the game hub for an individual title, then checking to see if you have the upgrade license available, then downloading that version entirely.
It&#x27;s a shame that this is where we&#x27;re at nearly two years after the launch of the PS5 (the anniversary is happening this week!), but it is what it is. The tools to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen to you are out there!

                              <span>Dive into the Upside Down
Netflix Games, in association with developer Tender Claws, has announced that it will be adapting its hugely popular horror series, Stranger Things, for the VR platform. According to the publisher Stranger Things VR will launch in the winter of 2023 for all &quot;major VR platforms&quot;.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wQnFM5X5XQM
Perhaps surprisingly, players will actually take up the role of Vecna — the antagonist of the show&#x27;s fourth season — as they attempt to wreak havoc and vengeance on both the town of Hawkins and, in particular, its powerful psychic savior, Eleven. Stranger Things VR will see Vecna, (and by proxy, the player) invade multiple worlds, conjure up terrifying and vivid nightmares, and engage in reality-shattering psychological warfare.
In many ways, Stranger Things is custom designed for virtual reality, given its &quot;no rules&quot; approach to the simple act of physical existence. While VR, for many, remains little more than a somewhat interactable rollercoaster ride/ghost train, it is a medium that perfectly suits franchises that focus on the strange, the bizarre, and the warped. And, as such, fans of The Upside Down and its occupants would likely have a real thrill ride exploring its mind-bending themes and aesthetic in fully immersive 3D action.

                              <span>It&#x27;s running through November 9
A new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it&#x27;s currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.
As a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it&#x27;ll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector&#x27;s edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It&#x27;ll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
Here is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:
Rabbid Mario Figurine
Rabbid Peach Figurine
Set of 3 lithographs
Spark Plush
Artbook
Spark Phone Ring Holder
Stickers Sheet
[Update: Here&#x27;s a reminder that the contest ends on November 9 at 2AM ET. Effectively, unless you&#x27;re a night owl, you have until tomorrow evening in most regions to put your Platinum Points up.]

                              <span>And what will be left of them?
Supermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of The Devil in Me, the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, The Dark Pictures. Publisher Bandai Namco released a new trailer, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator&#x27;s world.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the &quot;The Murder Castle&quot; — the opulent estate of America&#x27;s first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;VUcFLkAZmyo
The trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all The Dark Pictures titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most &quot;slasher&quot; based, perhaps eschewing the supernatural and/or monster-based terror of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a Shining-esque bar and a Tourist Trap range of animatronics, to Saw-style &quot;death traps&quot; and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.
The Devil in Me will represent the culmination of The Dark Pictures&#x27; first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of previously trademarked titles, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Roaming Gimmighouls are in Go early, too
Pokemon Go and Scarlet/Violet connectivity is confirmed by way of a tweet from the official Pokemon Twitter account, which asks players to &quot;stay by for future announcements.&quot;
Interestingly, a new Pokemon has been shown off as a result of this collaboration. It&#x27;s called &quot;Gimmighoul,&quot; and follows a long line of mythological tricksters that are focused around coins/gold/wealth.  Gimmighoul takes on a &quot;chest form&quot; in Scarlet and Violet, and functions a lot like a Mimic treasure chest in many other forms of fantasy media. But it also sports a &quot;roaming form,&quot; which is live in Pokemon Go now.
Here&#x27;s a breakdown:
&quot;Research conducted by Professor Willow and Jacq, a biology teacher from the Paldea region, confirms that Trainers have spotted Gimmighoul in its Roaming Form. Further, there’s another form in the Paldea region called Chest Form Gimmighoul.&quot;

We also get a reconfirmation that Pokemon Home support is still planned for Scarlet and Violet after launch. Right at 5:01 in the below video at the bottom of the screen, you&#x27;ll see that Scarlet/Violet connectivity &quot;is expected to be added to Pokemon Home after the game&#x27;s release.&quot; Future announcements will come at a later date.
While Pokemon connectivity is often rolled out haphazardly or late, it&#x27;s nice to know that it&#x27;s coming at some point.

                              <span>The Devil&#x27;s in the Details
As Blizzard Entertainment continues beavering away at its upcoming sequel Diablo IV, the rumor mills have started churning out potential dates for the eventual return of one of gaming&#x27;s grimmest and most uniquely compelling dungeon crawlers. We have already been told the title will be &quot;playable&quot; in 2023, though when and in what form remains a mystery.
Enter frequent spoiler XboxEra podcast, as hosted by Windows Central. In the most recent episode of the show, it was suggested that Blizzard could be planning on launching the sequel as soon as April of next year, with pre-orders opening in December, perhaps following a brand new trailer at the upcoming Game Awards show, which is currently scheduled to take place exactly one month from now. Pre-orders are expected to include standard editions alongside Blizzard&#x27;s typical premium collector&#x27;s set.

Of course, this is mostly hearsay (or should that be &quot;heresy&quot;?) for now, but the XboxEra podcast has been pretty much on the money when it comes to the revelation of upcoming projects and release dates. We already know that Diablo IV is in a very playable form, as private betas have been circling among staff and colleagues for some time now (complete with oodles of leaked footage). Sping 2023 still seems a little early, but if Overwatch 2 has taught us anything, Blizzard is not the &quot;ready when it&#x27;s ready&quot; company it once was, and is seemingly far more interested in getting products out in customers&#x27; hands ASAP.
Diablo IV is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

That&#x27;s a solid £5 below the price of the same drive on Amazon, and well into bargain buy territory for anyone that wants to cheaply and easily add more storage to their desktop or laptop. If you have any old laptops that are still running on hard drives, for example, then this could be an awesome low-cost upgrade!

Normally the Stream Deck costs £150, but today it&#x27;s down to £90 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Compared to many of the latest FPS offerings out there, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fossil. It&#x27;s such a simplistic looking game, right? A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it&#x27;s more refined than basically any of its competitors.

                              <span>I, like many people I know these days, will only watch a YouTube video if it&#x27;s either less than 5 minutes or more than an hour long. YouTube evolved a while ago into a platform for long-form video essays, and I for one am happy about it. Even better: Jenny Nicholson just released an almost four hour video on an uncompleted attraction in Utah called Evermore. Evermore is a sort of theme park-slash-immersive-theatre that appears to have been beset both by uncontrollable world events and bad management, but I still want to go because it looks pretty fun(ny). 
I did think about what games I would like to become immersive experience theme parks in this kind of vein, though, and I gotta say... I&#x27;m coming up empty.

Weapons and outfits from six games are making their way into the game with today&#x27;s free Everone Is Here 2 update: Terraria, Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Slay The Spire, Risk Of Rain 2, and Katana Zero. There’s also new lore rooms based on locations from these games, which is where you’ll find the weapons stored. You can watch some of the costumes and weapons in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer - not including Warzone 2.0 - brings out the best of COD&#x27;s excellent gunplay on an array of colourful maps that largely deliver. And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn&#x27;t make it an athletics competition.
And while the game&#x27;s multiplayer is a slick refinement of what&#x27;s come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve got the game installed on an SSD...

If you are in the market, you could thefore find, say, a list of the best early Black Friday gaming keyboard deals very useful indeed. Hey, here&#x27;s one.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023. Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.

                              <span>There’s a war going on between instalments in the Battlefield series, and it looks like Battlefield 1 is coming out on top for now. The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it&#x27;s since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by tactical mecha action, a spinny shotgun, and honestly a good number of games and things which I don&#x27;t entirely understand—a mood I&#x27;m always here for. Check &#x27;em out!

                              <span>Fresh hell could arrive in April 2023 in the form of a Diablo 4 launch, if new rumours are accurate. Windows Central and the XboxEra podcast both say they’ve heard the release window from sources. That’s not all, as details of the fantasy action RPG’s release could be announced on December 8th at The Game Awards, according to both sets of sources. These include pre-orders opening during the show, and a February 2023 open beta.

                              <span>It’s nearly the end of the year, a time when many a person&#x27;s thoughts turn to the birth of Jesus Christ (along with whether or not they’re getting FIFA 23 on Christmas morning). Forget about other games for the moment though, because one developer’s bringing The Bible itself to Steam. The appropriately named Bible Games are releasing a fully voiced version of the good book on November 14th, complete with trivia quizzes to check your biblical knowledge. You can watch the surprisingly dramatic trailer below.

Sonic the Hedgehog lore, hey? More confusing that a Zelda timeline? Probably not. But there&#x27;s been a lot of games, comics, TV shows, and movies, and not all of them are tied together. So Sega has said &quot;enough is enough&quot; and the company is now hiring for a Sonic the Hedgehog loremaster. Yes, really.
Sega of America has posted a job listing for &#x27;Associate Manager, Lore&#x27; for the Sonic Team over on LinkedIn (thanks Kotaku!). The job is located at the company&#x27;s Burbank office in California, and you&#x27;ll need to be able to commute to and work from the office two days a week, with the remaining workdays being remote. The lucky candidate will be reporting to, and this is a real job, the Director of Lore and Creative Strategy.

Last week we got a release date for Forever Entertainment&#x27;s Front Mission 1st: Remake, a remake of the original Super Famicom Front Mission game. And following a gameplay reveal on Thursday, the developer has revealed that you&#x27;ll be able to choose between &#x27;Classic&#x27; and &#x27;Modern&#x27; modes, which will keep both newcomers and fans happy (thanks, Siliconera!).
In the brief clip, shared on Twitter, Forever Entertainment has compared the two modes to one another. Classic mode is closer to the old-school style of the original release, with a fixed orthogonal camera and the original soundtrack. Modern mode, however, gives you a remastered soundtrack, a different camera angle (with the ability to change the camera angle), and brings in other fixes and tweaks.

                              <span>A deep dive into a forgotten classic.
When discussing horror games for the Nintendo Wii, there&#x27;s one in particular that absolutely dominates the coversation thanks to its astounding impact and enduring legacy: Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition. It&#x27;s such an important game that some of the other horror titles on the Wii often get overlooked - undeservedly so, in our opinion.
One such game that&#x27;s still very much worth playing to this day is Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. It launched back at the tail end of 2009 for North America, arriving at a time when public confidence in Konami&#x27;s survival horror franchise was starting to wane in the wake of disappointing sequels such as Silent Hill: Homecoming. Nevertheless, Shattered Memories remains one of the more critically acclaimed entries to the series, making excellent use of the Wii&#x27;s unique control capabilities to really immerse players in the experience.

                              <span>Except for Kanto because come on – they’re obviously the best.
While The Pokémon Company reveals the adorable starters at the beginning of a new Generation’s media cycle to feature them prominently in trailers, merch, events and whatever else the juggernaut of a franchise puts on, the final evolutions of these cute critters remain a carefully guarded secret until someone unceremoniously leaks some blurry photos a week or two before release. It’s these much more powerful forms that you’ll spend most of your time with and that have a larger legacy on the series as a whole.
Look no further than Kanto&#x27;s Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise as proof. They’ve appeared in many subsequent games and remained competitively viable in official formats ever since. Venusaur terrorises with Chlorophyll and Sleep Powder. Defensively sound, Blastoise can wash away a whole team after a single Shell Smash. And Charizard hits like a flame-engulfed truck under the Sun. On top of all this, all three have awesome, memorable designs that make it hard to pick between them. For these reasons, we’ve decided to omit them from this list – we all know they’re objectively the best starter trio. It doesn’t need repeating. You&#x27;ve even told us yourself that Generation I has the best starters of every single type.

Well, Sonic Frontiers is almost here, folks. Sonic&#x27;s first new 3D adventure in five years launches tomorrow, 8th November, and some reviews have been speeding through the checkpoint to prepare you ahead of time. And they&#x27;re all over the shop! Sounds like a 3D Sonic game, doesn&#x27;t it?
At the time of writing, most of the reviews for Sonic Frontiers are for other platforms and very few cover the Switch release of the game. As a result, you&#x27;ll have to be patient for the NL verdict on this one — no spin-dashing for us here — as Switch review codes were late out of the door. But rest assured, we&#x27;ll have our thoughts up as soon as we can.

Dotemu and Tribute Games&#x27; fantastic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge has been updated to version 1.0.4, bringing with it a handful of small tweaks and bug fixes to help tighten up the brawler even more.
Shared on Steam by the developers (thanks, Nintendo Everything), many of these changes are for the PC version of the game, though others are for all console versions.

After literal years of waiting, Bayonetta 3 finally launched for the Nintendo Switch at the end of October. For many, the game stands as one of the finest action titles every released and builds on what the first two games accomplished with their respective gameplay mechanics.
According to Imran Khan (former Senior Editor at Game Informer), however, the game was originally planned to be much broader in scope when compared to the final product, and was supposedly meant to be open-world. Khan states that the design would draw inspiration from PlatinumGames&#x27; previous Switch title Astral Chain and would feature an open-world hub world from which Bayonetta would visit various locations:

It may come as no surprise that we here at Nintendo Life love the Switch. Did it manage to solve problems with portability that we didn&#x27;t even know we had? Yes it did. Did it bring everyone back round to Nintendo when the Wii U had managed to do otherwise? You betcha. Is Joy-Con drift rapidly becoming the bane of our lives. Well, yeah kinda. Fortunately, we&#x27;ve made a video which addresses just that.
That&#x27;s right, drift is still a problem, and we are still upset about it. There is no Switch issue so painful as trying to move one way while your on-screen character seems determined to move another, and that&#x27;s all thanks to a little piece of dirt (dust, fluff, toast or otherwise) sneaking into the controller and ruining your day.

Another day, another big review embargo. It&#x27;s the season of massive video game releases, with first-party titans like God of War (which is pretty good, apparently), Bayonetta 3 (which we liked quite a lot), and the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet battling out with third-party giants like Modern Warfare 2 and, today, a certain blue hedgehog. Microsoft, quite wisely, has chosen to avoid the kerfuffle by not releasing any first-party games at all. This year. We joke, Xbox friends — we love you! Now back to Game Pass with you...
Ahem, where were we? Ah yes, Sonic. You&#x27;re probably wondering where our Sonic Frontiers review is, especially as some players have got their hands on physical copies early. You may even have seen people streaming the game. Unfortunately, we weren&#x27;t among the lucky ones with a physical version dropping early through our letterbox.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

These days, it feels like games are very generally cast into either the ‘Indie’ or ‘AAA’ categories, regardless of genre. Square Enix has been a major publisher that’s notably been pushing back against this dichotomy by putting out several games that are smaller in scope than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, but have much higher production values than a budget indie game. Titles like The Diofield Chronicle or the Voice of Cards trilogy have filled this niche well, and now Square is doing it again with Harvestella. Billed by many as the company’s attempt at the Rune Factory formula, this farm sim and action-RPG hybrid does a solid job of merging two very different genres into a cohesive experience. It’s far from perfect, but this feels like a very solid foundation that will hopefully be built upon in the future.
Harvestella takes place in a world ruled over by four giant crystals called “Seaslights” that govern the passing of the four seasons. Some undisclosed amount of time before the narrative begins, the Seaslights begin to act strangely and introduce a new, one-day season that the residents come to call “Quietus” or the season of death. During Quietus, an evil &#x27;death dust&#x27; fills the air and anything living that ventures outside will die upon contact with the dust. Well, except your conveniently amnesiac character, who wakes up on the ground outside in a village during Quietus. After somehow surviving, the locals let you stay in a ‘shed’ on the edge of town while you recover your memory, and you soon start to try your hand at farming. Eventually, you then get caught up in a grand quest to investigate the Seaslights’ disturbance and hopefully learn more about where you came from.

The newly released metroidvania Ghost Song is, by all accounts, a pretty solid game, but our own experiences with the Switch version left a bit of a sour taste in our mouths when it came to the performance. In our review, we stated that it &quot;suffers from significant performance problems on Switch, from an inconsistent frame rate to extensive loading times that destroy any flow the game has&quot;.
Well, thankfully then, it seems that developer Old Moon has already moved to address the frame rate issues, which should hopefully make for a more stable experience for players. The news comes via a Twitter update from creator Matt White, who states that the frame rate has now been locked for Switch:

We are so very close now to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s release next week on 18th November, and predictably certain game-spoiling leaks have started appearing online.
This specific leak appears to have stemmed from someone managing to get their hands on a copy of the game prior to its official release date, though it is unclear as to whether this has been a product of a retailer missing the mark or if the game has been attained by other means.

Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has just received a small, albeit rather important new update to fix a number of pretty severe bugs currently present in the game. We&#x27;ve got the full patch notes right here for you and while it&#x27;s all quite brief compared to some of the more gargantuan patch notes we&#x27;ve seen, it should make for a far more pleasant experience for players going forwards.
So without further ado, here&#x27;s what the latest patch (version 1.0.2) has addressed in Three Hopes:

Update: We&#x27;ve amended the headline of this article to include a small quote and better reflect the comments made by Chiplock in the Kiwi Talkz interview. As pointed out, it is certainly possible that the voice actor is unable to discuss his potential involvement due to an NDA. Original text below:

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is fast approaching its release date of May 12th, 2023 (yes, it&#x27;ll be here a lot sooner than you think!), so it&#x27;s likely that Nintendo is currently in the final stages of development for the game and ironing out any egregious bugs that might still be lying about.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.
Game Informer: What happened in Scorn?
Peklar: Whatever you understood happened.
Was the ending in the game always the planned ending?

                              <span>The first Gear of War game was released 16 years ago today, and Netflix is celebrating by announcing plans to adapt the series into both a live-action film and an adult animated series. 
The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

                              <span>November 7 is N7 Day for Mass Effect fans, meaning all eyeballs are on BioWare in hopes it’ll release any info on its upcoming Mass Effect sequel. So far, the developer has satisfied that demand by releasing a brief video teaser containing hints of what’s to come. 


According to BioWare, fans should examine the 25-second clip “a bit more closely” as it is apparently chock full of clues. A tweet provided a link to download the video, though you can watch it above. It features what appears to be a mass relay under construction. The text in the bottom left corner seemingly confirms this. It reads: 
You&#x27;ll notice that the numbers at the bottom change as the camera zooms, similar to a video recording timer. You can spot a number of large ships floating nearby, but the one that stands out is the smaller vessel with blue-tinted engines cruising across the bottom right near the &quot;MR 7&quot; decal. Some fans have theorized it’s the same ship that appears in last year’s N7 Day teaser; others have proposed that it’s the Tempest from Mass Effect: Andromeda. There’s also the question of what planet the relay is orbiting. 
The fifth Mass Effect was formally announced via a teaser trailer during The Game Awards in 2020. We still know next to nothing about the title, including its projected release window. In May, it appeared BioWare accidentally revealed Commander Shepard’s return thanks to a collectible lithograph with a store description that read, &quot;While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.&quot; However, BioWare quickly changed this text and clarified that it was a mistake written by online store owners who were unfamiliar with the franchise. With BioWare also hard at work on Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, which seems slated to arrive first, it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess when we&#x27;ll get the first substantial look at Mass Effect.

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …</span>

                              <span>Trápí vás, že multimetry s digitálním výstupem naměřených hodnot jsou tak drahé? Že si snadno nemůžete nalogovat nabíjení svých solárních baterií? Bastlíře z projektu MacGyver SiliconHill také a proto na internetu vyšmejdili způsob, jak dostávat naměřená data z levného multimetru z běžného nákupního řetězce! Pokud se chcete také dozvědět jak na to, doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu – virtuální setkání (nejen) ajťáků, bastlířů, elektroniků, fyziků.</span>

[Update: This article has been updated with new information revealed in the time since launch.]
During the Overwatch 2 Reveal Event this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what&#x27;s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.
If you&#x27;ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn&#x27;t the focus of today&#x27;s stream — and the new story missions won&#x27;t be playable until 2023 — but we&#x27;ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.
Coming off of Overwatch 1, the team&#x27;s main goal is to try and deliver content on a &quot;frequent and consistent basis,&quot; according to game director Aaron Keller.

Happy weekend, friends, and welcome to this birthday edition of Whatcha Been Playing? Whose birthday, you ask? Why it&#x27;s my birthday! That&#x27;s right, today sees The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse slide one more bead over on the abacus of life. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how I got this far — a life packed to capacity with long walks, bad houses, far too many tablets, and even more donuts. But I&#x27;m still here, because, no matter how bad things might have gotten from time to time, there is always much to do, much to achieve, much to enjoy, and many fine people still to meet.
Today is going to be a bit of a quiet one for me, unfortunately. But it&#x27;s ok. Everyone on Destructoid has been very busy lately with the ongoing site transition, and I&#x27;m grateful for the quiet weekend. I will probably …</span>

You know that feeling you get when you&#x27;re driving down a highway at sunset, and the perfect song comes on the radio? All of a sudden, it feels like you&#x27;re in a music video, or that bit at the start of a &#x27;90s teen movie, where everything is sparkling and perfect. The music becomes a soundtrack, and your life becomes a story.
There are a few brilliant moments like this in media, too — ones that deploy the right song at the right moment for a perfect synergy of feelings. Think of how Edgar Wright uses licensed music in his films to underline tense, snappy moments and add comedy, or the use of Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me) at the end of The Breakfast Club, or the Imogen Heap-scored season 2 finale of The O.C., which became so iconic that it got its own SNL skit.

Over the past decade, the Metroidvania has seen a tremendous resurgence in popularity. And yet, it’s easy to forget how far we’ve come. If we rewind the clock back to the year 2013, the Metroid and Castlevania franchises were on ice and the indie Metroidvania scene was only just beginning to take off. That’s when Matt White launched a Kickstarter for a Super Metroid-inspired game, titled Ghost Song, which smashed through its original funding goals and went into full production. Now, nearly a decade later, Ghost Song has finally been released on Nintendo Switch, and it is a wonderful homage to some of the genre’s greatest entries, although Switch perhaps isn&#x27;t the best place to play.
In the first few minutes of the game, you’ll immediately notice that Ghost Song has two primary inspirations. Level design, enemy designs, and atmosphere influences are clearly based on Metroid. Single-block vertical platforming reminiscent of Super Metroid and the primary enemy design looking eerily similar to a Chozo will make any Samus fan feel at home. As for gameplay, however, Ghost Song instead draws heavily from Dark Souls. You lose your currency when falling in battle, having to trek back to where you last died in order to reclaim them. Using those, you can choose to level up certain stats, like health or damage, at statues around the map. There estus flask equivalents, which can be used at any time and refilled at save points.

                              <span>Trápí Vás, že multimetry s digitálním výstupem naměřených hodnot jsou tak drahé? Že si snadno nemůžete nalogovat nabíjení svých solárních baterií? Bastlíře z projektu MacGyver SiliconHill také a proto na internetu vyšmejdili způsob, jak dostávat naměřená data z levného multimetru z běžného nákupního řetězce. Pokud se chcete také dozvědět jak na to, dorazte na Virtuální Bastlírnu – virtuální setkání (nejen) ajťáků, bastlířů, elektroniků, fyziků.

Bastlíři z křemíkového kopce pro vás ještě našli jak používat SMD rezistory velikost 2512 místo tenzometrů, že KiCAD ve verzi 7.0 bude podporovat knihovny v externích SQL databázích a že na poslední verzi macOS Ventura dojde k rozbití podpory RP2040. A mnoho dalšího.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte. Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

Back in mid-2020, Iron Man VR was unleashed into the world via the PSVR. While it made somewhat of a splash in the VR community at the time, I haven&#x27;t really heard of it since then: but thankfully, more folks are getting the chance to check it out thanks to a Quest 2 release this week.
In case you missed it before, Iron Man VR is essentially an Iron Man simulator, complete with dual-hand repulsor control, and a unique storyline. You&#x27;ll spend a lot of time thrusting around vistas and open canyons blowing up robots, chasing up leads and even walking around a bit as Tony Stark.
All of the same core gameplay is back, and it still works. The idea of simply using two separate VR controllers as Iron Man hands is genius, as you can fly or shoot with either han…</span>

                              <span>A decade later, the fire still burns
Little Inferno is a name you might not have heard in quite a while. The indie project about burning things for fun and profit is back in 2022, with the Little Inferno Ho Ho Ho Holiday Expansion.
Arriving on November 18, Little Inferno is ringing in the festive season with plenty of kindling. Nutcrackers, reindeer, jelly beans, and more are all ripe for the flame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;R3DWkqFyqhw
It&#x27;s a pretty sizeable expansion, with an entirely new story and a new character. Plenty of holiday products await your flame, and there are over 50 new combos to discover. Or you can just get the infinitely burning Yule Log and have yourself a relaxing, cozy night by the TV light.
All I want for Christmas is fuel
Little Inferno first lit a spark back in 2012, becoming a bit of a sensation in an ever-growing indie scene. Developer Tomorrow Corporation has gone on to make some fun puzzle games, like Human Resource Machine and 7 Billion Humans.
But something about the discoverability and mystery of Little Inferno still feels all its own. While it&#x27;s made it to new consoles in the time since its debut, seeing a new DLC drop for it this many years later is pretty exciting.
So if you want to ring in the new year with a little fuel and a little fire, Little Inferno is back with more reasons to celebrate the season. It&#x27;s up for wishlisting on Steam, Epic, and GOG, and is headed to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android sometime soon.

                              <span>Must be talking to an angel...
The retro gaming aficionados over at Hamster are continuing on their current trend of pulling out bafflingly bizarre and outrageously obscure arcade titles for your approval — And this week&#x27;s entry is no different, with the arrival of Nichibutsu&#x27;s unique, star-gazing... shmup? Mischievous Angel.
Released to arcades in 1984, (as Itazura Tenshi), this surprisingly novel little release sees the player don the wings of a starbound angel, who is tasked with recreating the constellations in order to impress his pretty angel pal. Using non-linear, eight-way directional gameplay, our heroes travel through a gridded starscape, lining up stars in a &quot;dot-to-dot&quot; fashion in order to complete various famous star signs and constellations, such as The Big Dipper... umm... Jerry The Cowboy... and... Alan... The Cowboy.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5M9ut_Ovm3w
As the not-so-mischievous angel lights up the sky, they must also avoid attack from sensible villains such as alien invaders, witches, and flying jesters. Fear not, as grabbing a bow and arrow will offer up temporary firepower to fend off these ne&#x27;er-do-wells. Because he&#x27;s also Cupid?.. or Kid Icarus?.. or something. Following several cosmos of action, our young lovers must be reunited in a recurring bonus stage so wholesome and melancholy that is has to be seen to be believed.
Mischievous Angel is, despite its admittedly dated mechanics, a pretty unique and cute take on the shmup genre, with a delightful concept and some sweet visual design ideas. While hardly a smash hit of the arcade circuit, it is undeniably an original idea, and it is nice to see this quirky release curated in the Arcade Archives range.
Mischievous Angel is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

Monster Rancher, for me, has always been a game I enjoyed more for its gimmick rather than its gameplay. Back in the ‘90s, I wasn’t too hot about slowly raising a monster through battles, training, and adventures just to eventually fuse them with another monster and start the process all over again. I was far more interested in the gimmick. I went through every CD in my parent’s collection, unlocking whatever monsters were tied to their Garth Brooks and Shania Twain albums. My friends at school would exchange CDs and report back what we unlocked.
For me, that was the game. I didn’t care too much about being an actual rancher. I just wanted to see what monsters I would get if I put in my Space Jam CD. Would I even care about this series if it didn’t have that…</span>

Signs pointed to a big reveal of Mauga as the next hero to join the Overwatch 2 cast at tonight&#x27;s Overwatch League Grand Finals. But, signs are often wrong, and during the event, a different character was revealed to be joining the fight next. An omnic and the leader of Null Sector, Ramattra will be the next tank to join the roster in Overwatch 2 season 2. Ramattra is on a mission to make the world a better place for the omnics by any means necessary. This will be the second tank added to the Overwatch cast since the game was relaunched as Overwatch 2.

Ramattra will join the hero shooter on December 6. As somebody who played the original Overwatch for many months after Blizzard stopped adding new characters, it&#x27;s great to finally see a steady flow of new faces for the game. Now if only I could get teamed up with people who know what the hell they&#x27;re doing.
I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what Overwatch 2 season 2 has in store. I just hope I actually have the time to play it. Sadly, Marvel Snap is currently eating up all my free time alongside the four different farming games I&#x27;m playing at the moment. In what time I have been able to spend with the game, I&#x27;ve mostly stuck with the healers I&#x27;ve been using for years while trying to relearn all the different damage characters that I haven&#x27;t messed with since 2020. However, I have been looking for a new tank since the game completely reworked Orisa. Maybe Ramattra will become my next go-to hero on that front. And if not, I can always fall back on boring ol&#x27; Reinhardt.

                              <span>More virtual Keanu
Lionsgate is toying with the idea of another John Wick video game. The entertainment company&#x27;s CEO said in a recent earnings call that the studio is fielding proposals.
As reported by IndieWire, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said the company has been &quot;fielding proposals&quot; around a John Wick game.
&quot;I don’t want to get ahead of myself here, but we believe there is a big AAA game to be made out of John Wick,&quot; said Feltheimer. &quot;We have been fielding proposals. We certainly are interested in moving that forward, but I don’t want to say anything more about that at this time.&quot;
It&#x27;s not a major commitment. But it is interest in a franchise that&#x27;s already seen some adaptation, and could see more.

I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; I&#x27;m back
John Wick has already had his own game, in the form of Bithell Games&#x27; John Wick Hex. The studio imagined Wick&#x27;s action-heavy shootouts in turn-based strategy puzzles, in a way that reminded me a bit of Invisible, Inc.
It sounds like John Wick Hex turned out alright, too. But the CEO&#x27;s choice of words, in &quot;big&quot; and &quot;AAA,&quot; bring to mind a hefty investment.
Considering the only other John Wick adaptation we have in the virtual space aside from Hex is a Fortnite cameo, there&#x27;s still room. A studio like Sloclap could absolutely tackle something fast-paced and action-heavy in the Wick universe. Though my personal choice would be to give this the Alpha Protocol treatment. Either way, I&#x27;m all for more digital Keanu.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s premium broadcasters use conditional access systems to restrict viewing to paying customers and prevent piracy. These systems are reportedly very good but that&#x27;s making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

                              <span>Who do you think the new hero will be?
Overwatch is back in full swing with the release of the sequel, and that means we&#x27;re back in the swing of the hype surrounding new hero releases. I mean, I still mostly stick to the roster of original heroes because I like the simplicity of their kits, but even if I don&#x27;t plan on playing any of the new additions, their presence still switches up the meta significantly. Now rumors are flying as to who the newest recruit to the Overwatch lineup is going to be, and the frontrunner as of now is Mauga, a Talon Heavy Assault and former friend of Baptiste.
Mauga appeared in a short story called &quot;What You Left Behind,&quot; which focused on Baptiste&#x27;s backstory and was released alongside the Baptiste Reunion Challenge mini-event. Mauga and Baptiste were both part …</span>

                              <span>Don&#x27;t worry about the differences too much, though
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is getting a new version this month. The latest TMNT title is getting a native PS5 version on November 15.
What&#x27;s different? Aside from running natively on the PlayStation 5, not much. Tribute Games and DotEmu have made it clear this version is identical to the PlayStation 4 version of TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. Previously, TMNT would run on backward compatibility for the PS5, using the PS4 version.
This does mean that PS4 users aren&#x27;t getting a free upgrade to the new version. But again, this is apparently not a substantively different option. So the reason why DotEmu and Tribute are making this? Well, it looks like for a possible physical version.
&quot;The PS5 version is necessary to eventually offer physical PS5 copies ;),&quot; the Tribute Games account noted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ozKsDzumb0c
So if you&#x27;ve got one PlayStation copy, you still seem set. And down the line, this might allow for a PS5 physical version of the turtle-based beat &#x27;em up.
A new platform for TMNT
Shredder&#x27;s Revenge was released earlier this year, and brought a whole lot of Saturday morning cartoon action to PC and consoles. The TMNT beat &#x27;em up did pretty alright in sales too, so it&#x27;s not too surprising to see these studios considering future options with the native PS5 edition.
Whether we see more content arrive in TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge in the future or not seems up in the air. I&#x27;d love to see the crew dip deeper into TMNT nostalgia, but considering DotEmu especially has a good track record for beat &#x27;em ups, I&#x27;m eager to see whatever&#x27;s in store next.

Between graphics, overall game design, and storytelling techniques, games have come a long way over the past few years, but the most impressive improvements have come from the new accessibility settings that developers are including in their games -- like God of War, for example. Never before have we seen such close attention to detail in making the interactive medium more readily available to anyone who wants to play, and Santa Monica Studio is helping to blaze the trail with the release of God of War Ragnarok. 
The developers posted an exhaustive blog on the PlayStation website that goes through every possible accessibility setting in God of War Ragnarok, and it&#x27;s pretty cool to see in my opinion. There are sections in the menu for Vision, Hearing, and Motor Access…</span>

Bruce Wayne has had many ups and downs in his personal life, in just about every single iteration of Batman media that he appears in: it&#x27;s kind of his thing. And the same goes for the sea of Batman video games; which, quite frankly, is filled with sunken barges of ill-advised movie tie-ins and projects that just didn&#x27;t have as much love and care as they should have.
Here&#x27;s a list of our top five Batman games throughout the ages.

5 - Batman: The Video Game (NES)
A dark horse pick that Bruce Wayne himself would have been proud of: the surprisingly influential movie tie-in game on the NES takes number five.
I recall renting this ages ago at my local Power Video, and I was completely blown away. Not only does it stray far from the Tim Burton movie it attempts to replic…</span>

Following on from its eye-widening PlayStation VR 2 (PSVR2) price reveal, Sony Interactive Entertainment has released a list of games that will be arriving in 2023 on the virtual reality hardware. The list of 11 titles leans heavily on the spooky-ooky, spearheaded by The Dark Pictures: Switchback.
A spin-off entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; enjoyable horror anthology, The Dark Pictures: Switchback is a literal rollercoaster ride through an array of creepy environments, jump-scares, and other frightening imagery. It seems very similar in concept to Supermassive&#x27;s own Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, which was also a VR rollercoaster ride released for the original PSVR hardware in 2016.

The Dark Pictures: Switchback is one of only two titles on the new list that appears to be a PSVR2 exclusive, joining Smilegate shooter Crossfire: Sierra Squad. The previously revealed launch title Horizon: Call of the Mountain — also available in a bundle with the new hardware — is also expected to be PSVR2 only. The full list of 11 titles is as follows, with release dates still to be announced.
Crossfire: Sierra Squad - (Smilegate)
The Dark Pictures: Switchback - (Supermassive Games)
The Light Brigade - (Funktronic Labs)
Cities VR: Enhanced Edition – (Fast Travel Games)
Cosmonious High - (Owlchemy Labs)
Hello Neighbor: Search &amp; Rescue - (tinyBuild Games)
Jurassic World Aftermath Collection - (Coatsink)
Pistol Whip - (Cloudhead Games)
Zenith: The Last City - (Ramen VR)
After the Fall - (Vertigo Games)
Tentacular - (Firepunchd Games)
PlayStation VR2 launches worldwide February 22, 2023, priced at $550 USD. For more details on all of the PSVR2 games featured in the new list, check out the official PlayStation Blog.

It&#x27;s Friday, and that means that digital retailer Epic Games Store is ready to reveal the next titles that it will be offering up to its users free of charge — And this week, it&#x27;s a veritable mix of wholesomeness and wanton violence, with the arrival of Alba: A Wildlife Adventure and Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun.

Developed by British outfit ustwo Games, the almost unbearably wholesome Alba: A Wildlife Adventure was released to critical and public acclaim back in 2020. It concerns a simple tale of a young explorer who stumbles across a Mediterranian isle in need while on vacation. Armed with little more than a phone camera, a metric ton of spirit, and her friends and associates, Alba sets about capturing …</span>

[Update: The Breakers Collection beta is now live and can be downloaded from Steam.]
QuByte Interactive has announced that it will be holding an open beta this weekend to test the online stability of its long-time-coming rerelease Breakers Collection. The test period will kick off on PC (via Steam on Friday, November 4, and will rock on for an as-yet-undisclosed amount of time, ahead of the title&#x27;s January release.
Breakers Collection, as we have reported many times, is a compendium of two cult &#x27;90s fighters, Breakers and Breakers&#x27; Revenge, which was available in arcades and on the Neo Geo platform in the mid-1990s. The new rerelease features both games in their entirety, sporting modern-day technological boosts such as rollback netcode and crossplay support, as well as a range of cool new features including Team Battle Mode, Interactive Replays, online profiles, and a deep Training Mode.

If you want in on the beta beatings, then all you need do is wishlist Breakers Collection on Steam and download the beta client prior to the big server switch-on this Friday. While the Breakers titles struggled to find their feet alongside the Street Fighter Alpha series, as well as the then-influx of 3D fighters such as Tekken and Soulcalibur, there is no denying that the series has its own charm, and is still a fun and engaging 2D fighter even today, decades on from its initial release. This new release will provide the dedicated Breakers community with a much-needed official platform for the fighter&#x27;s competitive scene.
Breakers Collection launches January 12, 2023, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games.

                              <span>Plus, more classic Ratchet heads to PS Plus Premium
Insomniac Games and Sony are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise. Some throwback armor is headed to Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and some classic Ratchet is going on PlayStation Plus Premium.
The Ratchet &amp; Clank series kicked off in 2002, with the very first game for PlayStation 2. Since then, there have been quite a few entries in the duo&#x27;s adventures.
For the most recent, Rift Apart, Insomniac is releasing several sets of armor, free for all players. They arrive in a pack today. Here&#x27;s the full list:
Commando Armor (Inspired by Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando)
Holoflux Armor (Inspired by Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time)
Quest Armor (Inspired by Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Quest for Booty)
Marauder Armor (Inspired by Ratchet: Deadlocked)
Clank Armor

Ratcheting up the nostalgia
There are some classic Ratchet &amp; Clank games arriving soon for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers, too.
Several games, like Into the Nexus and Quest for Booty, are already on Premium&#x27;s game catalog. But on November 15, several more classic Ratchet &amp; Clank titles will hit the service. These are some classic titles, going back to the PS2 era of
Ratchet &amp; Clank (PS3)
Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando (PS3)
Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal (PS3)
Ratchet &amp; Clank: Deadlocked (PS3)
Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction (PS3)
Today&#x27;s PlayStation blog announcing the news also dug deep into the history vaults. There are a ton of quotes and tidbits from throughout the years, discussing the history of one of Sony&#x27;s most prominent faces. It&#x27;s a cool way to explore the history and legacy of Ratchet &amp; Clank, two decades on.
The new armor is available now in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. The older Ratchet titles hit PlayStation Plus Premium, one of Sony&#x27;s upper subscription tiers, on November 15.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll never be Maidenless
The prestige Japanese clothing company Edwin revealed a new line of apparel based upon Bandai Namco&#x27;s smash-hit RPG Elden Ring — As spotted by Siliconera, the Elden Ring x Edwin line will be made available to pre-order from the denim enthusiast&#x27;s official website this month, and is perfect for battling those winter winds (and giant hands).

First and foremost is this unique hooded cloak, stylized after that worn by Elden Ring&#x27;s top Kindling Maiden, Melina. The design features a wide hood and an expanding bell shape, so you&#x27;ll strike quite the figure walking down the high street as a big goth triangle. The cloak buttons up at the front and features the insignia of The Golden Order emblazoned on the back. It&#x27;s a very outlandish piece, but I really dig it.
The hooded cloak/jacket retails for ¥21,780 (roughly $150 USD) and can be ordered right here.

The second item in the Elden Ring x Edwin collection is a long sleeve denim shirt, which sports a more traditional-looking design for those of you who might not wish to be approached for side-quests. The shirt is manufactured in the same trademark Edwin denim, and also features the insignia of The Golden Order. I&#x27;m not sure about denim shirts personally, (they sort of make my skin crawl), but for non-wierdos, this is a pretty stylish bit of apparel.
The denim shirt retails for ¥10,780 (roughly $75 USD) and can be ordered right here. Obviously, both prices do not include shipping or any potential customs charges, but Edwin does serve multiple international outlets, so fans outside of Japan can bag themselves this exclusive merchandise. Pre-orders will open from November 15-25, with products expected to ship in March 2023.
Elden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>But where&#x27;s my girl, Peri?
Legendary British sci-fi show Doctor Who is the latest franchise to get its bean on in the madcap world of Mediatonic&#x27;s Fall Guys — The topsy-turvy battle royale title currently has a new range of cosmetic items up for grabs, all pulled from the time lord&#x27;s great canon of chrono-crossing adventures.
Three of the fourteen Doctors are represented in this new event, immediately recognizable thanks to the quirky hero&#x27;s penchant for fabulous fashions. We have the wild scarf and Autumnal style of the iconic Fourth Doctor, as portrayed by Tom Baker in the 1970s. Also available is the most recent incarnation of the character, the Thirteenth Doctor, played in groundbreaking fashion by Jodie Whittaker since 2018.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6xdRbMhduVE
The Fourteenth Doctor, who one might confuse for the Tenth Doctor, is available to purchase as a brand new skin for your been, celebrating the momentary return of fan-favorite actor David Tennant. And, of course, what would Doctor Who be without his arch-enemy, The Daleks? And thus, a Dalek costume is also available from the marketplace — Although, given that they can&#x27;t even get upstairs, Fall Guys hardly seems to be the perfect place for the ruthless, droning robots.
All four skins are available to purchase now in the Fall Guys store. In addition, a brand new emote will play the famous TARDIS sound effect upon activation. Sorry, it won&#x27;t automatically regenerate you beside the crown. You still gotta do all of the hard work yourself. Better bring your sonic screwdriver.
Fall Guys is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you&#x27;re interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember now if it was Monster Prom or Dream Daddy that introduced me to the dating sim genre, but Monster Prom was definitely my first dating sim hybrid, a sub-genre I&#x27;m now more than a bit obsessed with. Other favourite examples of mine include last year&#x27;s Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

                              <span>Harvestella, Square Enix&#x27;s swing at the farm &#x27;em up, is out now. It bundles crop management together with monsters to biff in a fantasy world where a new season called Quietus is muscling in like an extra mean version of winter. You&#x27;ll find a launch trailer below.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet&#x27;s surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

Handily, it’s made me realise that Paul Kaye – known for his Game Of Thrones role as resurrectionist Thoros of Myr, and for being mortally annoying as Dennis Pennis in the Nineties – is playing shock doc director Charlie. Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I&#x27;ve now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn&#x27;t have any history with either game before now, but it&#x27;s become increasingly apparent that they&#x27;re effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They&#x27;re so similar, in fact, that it&#x27;s kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre&#x27;s release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn&#x27;t be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

                              <span>When Team Ninja&#x27;s Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: &quot;Wow, that looks like my sort of jam&quot;. A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I&#x27;d say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out for the full release.

They’re due to air tonight, November 4th, in the US, and in the early hours of tomorrow morning for people on the other side of the Atlantic. That leaves enough time to place your bets on who it’ll turn out to be.

                              <span>We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

Developers Second Dinner told the Washington Post that an update to the free to play PC and mobile game that pits superpowered heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe against each other would be landing before 2023 begins. That’s cool and all, but if you’ve got thirty seconds then do yourself a favour and watch the virtually superhero-free Japanese trailer for Marvel Snap below, too.

In a statement posted to her Twitter account, Sarah Schachner expressed regret that work on the soundtrack by producer Mike Dean would not get to be heard by players. Dean collaborated with Schachner on the score for the previous Modern Warfare game.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is morish. Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

While Ryzen 7000 offers better performance, it also comes with steeper requirements - like DDR5 RAM, a 600-series motherboard and a much bigger budget. Here&#x27;s why we rate this particular CPU at this discounted price.

                              <span>Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”</span>

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with &quot;H&quot; and both their last names start with &quot;K.&quot; Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…</span>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel.

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…</span>

As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that&#x27;s great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you&#x27;re in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

That’s a lot of games! It’s also the showcase’s 10th anniversary so let&#x27;s all pop our party poppers and jump right into the indie list.

                              <span>Rainy Season is a game that speaks to that universal feeling of having your plans scuppered by inclement weather. We&#x27;ve all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio&#x27;s hour-long narrative game, it&#x27;s a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he&#x27;s got to face a day stuck inside his grandma&#x27;s house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

Flailing wildly at enemies with a big sword, axe, or warhammer, jostling them about with your implement of doom like armour-clad sausages frying in a pan, never seems to get old. What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution. It’s a mace that’s, well, Mace.

We talk about the characters that we relate to most, and also I find a way to mention Saturnalia again. Tune in next week to see if I can keep up my streak!
Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable. For myself and Nate the themes include sadness and drudgery. But there&#x27;s good news, because Nate has remembered to make me a Cavern Of Lies this week! Hooray!

Every November there’s a glut of discounted peripherals, and not just the sad plastic lumps that retailers won’t be able to sell otherwise – we’re talking real quality desk rats. This guide to the best early Black Friday gaming mouse deals confirms as much, as even with the big day itself not until the 25th, loads of new and old favourites are available with substantial savings.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing an awful lot of Overwatch 2 recently. As you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve played either of Blizzard&#x27;s near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

                              <span>I don’t know about you, but I’m not very good at reading Ye Olde Ynglishe. The letters are all curly, and my vision’s already a bit rubbish to begin with. Like a lot of specialised fonts, I find calligraphy awkward to read at best and virtually illegible at worst. That’s why I always appreciate when games make an effort to make text as accessible as possible. Case in point: Obsidian’s upcoming medieval mystery, Pentiment, which has an option to swtich to easy to read fonts baked in. Verily, thou hast mine thanks.

                              <span>If our glowing Signalis review has you hungry for more retro-styled survival horror, do also check out the new demo for Heartworm. Inspired by classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, Heartworm is neat even before you learn it&#x27;s almost entirely made by one person. It offers good times exploring a spooky house, bad times possibly trapped inside a neighbourhood in a VHS tape, and a very cosy time hanging out in the safe room. It is a lovely safe room.

                              <span>Only last week I was praising games that wanna be weird, and as such I must commend the weirdness of The Chant, a third-person action adventure where a retreat akin to Jared Leto&#x27;s definitely-not-a-cult finds itself crashing into a weird nightmare realm akin to the Upside Down from Stranger Things. The thing is, if anything I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s weird enough. If you&#x27;re going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

Now though, a new trailer gives a proper glimpse of what Holmes and Watson will be getting up to when they take on H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, once again for the very first time. Have a watch below, and try not to get lost in an ethereal netherworld inhabited by malevolent, sleeping gods.

The window for ranked play’s arrival was tweeted by Treyarch alongside some more things to expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, such as competitive modes, a Top 250 leaderboard, and visible skill ratings.

                              <span>Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that&#x27;s always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It&#x27;s a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland&#x27;s Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you&#x27;ll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you&#x27;re here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo&#x27;s Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry&#x27;s nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you&#x27;d hope.

To, co původně vypadalo jako kybernetický útok, se nakonec ukázalo být chybou v konfiguraci sítě. Její nedostatky vlastně jen omylem odhalil poslanec Róbert Halák, který objevil volný síťový kabel a zapojil ho do blízké zásuvky.</span>

                              <span>When it comes to DDR4 RAM, the market has decided that 3200MT/s CL16 is the perfect spec: noticeably faster than early DDR4-2133, 2400 and 2666, while being significantly cheaper than higher-end 3400, 3600 and 4000 kits. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that parrying projectiles is better than a customisable horn honk, and I wholly agree. I adore my collections of GTA clown cars but it&#x27;s no match. This week, we must choose between two slightly wistful things, one that&#x27;s come and gone and one that&#x27;s confined to a single game. And, ah, I cannot deny having been influenced by last week&#x27;s vote for one of these options. What&#x27;s better: feelies, or RULES OF NATURE? Vote now!

                              <span>Because I have. Maybe too much. 2816.6 hours of Dota 2, according to Steam, and that doesn’t count the days I’ve spent flying out to watch more talented people play it in arenas. It’s easy to get lost in, is Dota, and not just in the bad ways – even after a series of crap matches, it’s so easy to sink further into its incredible depth, its neverending wizard fight nuances, that it could be hour number 2820 before coming back up for air.

The update adds another 145 cards to the game and introduces the new Death Knight class. Cower from the Lich King’s icy wrath while you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Without a doubt, Elden Ring has spent hours of this year floating around my mind, like a parasitic gargoyle making a nest out of my stringy brain matter. Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I&#x27;m still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I&#x27;d reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don&#x27;t get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

If you’re thinking of picking up a notebook yourself, good timing: the best early Black Friday gaming laptop deals cover a nicely varied range of price points and specs combinations.

There’s loads of info about Nahida and her abilities in the trailer below, so watch away.

                              <span>Canadian studio and developers of sci-fantasy, turn-based tactics RPG Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, Complex Games, are joining UK-based publisher Frontier. Daemonhunters was released in May this year under the Frontier Foundry label, and we rather enjoyed it at the time. It seems as though, in the grand tradition of Remington shaver ads, Frontier liked the game so much that they bought the company.

                              <span>By far the best thing about the RTX 4090 – which is otherwise a bit of a GPU boondoggle – is that is supports DLSS 3. This next-gen version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler not only boosts performance with render resolution trickery but also adds entirely new, AI-generated frames of its own, smoothing out visuals even further. Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

                              <span>Developers Munfish have finally announced that its bonkers Soviet shooter Atomic Heart will release on February 21st, 2023. The new trailer for shooty alternate universe action RPG Atomic Heart is a bit of a trip, frankly. Barrelling along at the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, you can just about make out some weird looking Soviet robots, head-splitting mutants, and what seemed to be a truck plummeting towards towering futuristic architecture. Watch the eye-meltingly speedy trailer below, you’ll probably need some bugeye goggles afterwards to recuperate your peepers.

It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

The snippet of info that the new Deus Ex game is in the very, very early stages was reported by Bloomberg following yesterday’s revelation that sister studio Onoma is closing down. Eidos Montreal are also alleged to be working on a completely new game, as well as helping out with some co-development on some Microsoft-owned series, including the new Fable.

                              <span>As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it&#x27;s a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

                              <span>In January 2022, rightsholders began utilizing a new site-blocking law introduced by France, specifically targeted at live sports streaming piracy. In the following months, Internet providers were ordered to block hundreds of domain names. Positive results of the new legislation are already being reported and with Google taking action, the crackdown has serious momentum.

Original story: The Last of Us TV series will premiere in a little over two months if HBO&#x27;s page for the show is any indication. 
HBO Max subscribers began to notice that on the page for The Last of Us series on HBO, a description of the show says it premieres on January 15, as reported by Eurogamer. The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality&#x27;s Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can&#x27;t wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it&#x27;s hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we&#x27;ll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you&#x27;re interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish&#x27;s official website, where there&#x27;s info about the game&#x27;s different editions available for preorder and more.

                              <span>Look, everyone needs a flash drive. These things used to be the new hotness, back before email and cloud storage made them a bit irrelevant, but it&#x27;s still jolly useful to have one on hand to install (or recover) an OS, play (legally) downloaded videos on your TV or just bring your presentation in without worrying about something going wrong. 
So: the SanDisk 32GB Ultra Flair flash drive is down to £5 on Amazon after a ~40% discount. If you&#x27;ve not got a good, fast USB drive, then why not pick this one up while it&#x27;s on sale?

It&#x27;s able to outmatch some classic great value gaming CPUs, like the Ryzen 5 3600X and Core i5 11400F, and even comes close to the powerful (and more expensive) Core i5 11600K. All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

Enough games have failed to deliver on their promises over the years that I&#x27;ve learnt to be cautious for the most part. But I let my guard down with Slipways, because the premise was so simple. Simple, and beautiful.

I’ve been playing some pretty intense games recently, throttling my game controller as I run away from literal waves of rats in A Plague Tale: Requiem and shifting my detective brain into overdrive grappling with the excellent mysteries in The Case of the Golden Idol.
I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain.

                              <span>Frosty damage hero Mei has been removed from play in Overwatch 2 for the next fortnight while Blizzard address bugs affecting her ice wall ability. Unlike when Bastion was disabled because of his glitching ultimate, however, Mei does at least have a return date pencilled in. Blizzard are aiming to get her back in Overwatch 2 for November 15th, when the game’s next scheduled patch drops. That still might slip, though. What? I had to get an ice crack in.

                              <span>Just over a week ago, we launched a new introductory offer for the RPS supporter programme that chops the price of our monthly Standard tier down to just £1 / $1 for your first month. This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it&#x27;s clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we&#x27;re doing just that. 
For the month of November, we&#x27;ll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We&#x27;ve also made a bunch of Sin Vega&#x27;s indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we&#x27;ve got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we&#x27;re doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November. But wait... there&#x27;s more!

Microsoft today laid out the comings and goings for the first half of November, headlined by Return To Monkey Island. The revival of the revered point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game series will hit Game Pass next week, and until then you can tide yourself over with modernistic adventures from more of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead. Read on for the rest of the games coming in the next fortnight, including some on their launch day, and those sadly leaving too.

                              <span>Mount &amp; Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad. In fact, it&#x27;s overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord&#x27;s design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what&#x27;s been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn&#x27;t meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click &quot;make charcoal&quot;, then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you&#x27;ll discard hundreds of them. You can&#x27;t do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone&#x27;s pommel.

The original puzzle adventure was released on PC on October 31st 1997, and Cyan made their remake announcement exactly 25 years later. The new version of Riven will adopt the Myst remake’s freely 3D movement, but there are very few details yet other than that. Watch the very short announcement teaser below.

The revelation that EA and Marvel are forging some kind of Marvel Gaming Universe may delight or frustrate you, depending on how fed up you are with the MCU.

The music group successfully thwarted Yout&#x27;s request for a declaration that its service doesnt circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. This was a futile endeavor from the start, the RIAA argues.

                              <span>Copyright holders often write to internet billpayers claiming that their IP addresses have been linked to piracy. They say that billpayers are liable because they pirated content themselves or failed to stop someone else who did. When movie company Voltage Holdings tried to win default judgments against 30 internet subscribers, none of whom were shown to be the actual infringers, a judge refused to comply. In its appeal, Voltage says the judge made the wrong decision.

                              <span>According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn&#x27;t for Modern Warfare II&#x27;s cast of c…</span>

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Developer Salt &amp; Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That&#x27;s because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror&#x27;s inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you&#x27;ll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it&#x27;s slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that&#x27;s more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

                              <span>Logitech makes some of the best mainstream racing wheels and pedals on the market, but the cost of entry is still fairly steep: £269 for the PC/PlayStation-compatible G29 and the same for the PC/Xbox G920 variant. Today though, Currys in the UK are offering £80 off on either model when you use code WHEEL80, dropping the price down to £189.

The game is structured into four square panels in a two-by-two grid. Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene. This is where it gets cool: Any object you see that has some sort of frame around it - doorways, paintings, windows, photographs - you can actually move through them and discover new areas to explore.

                              <span>Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s lead hero designer has revealed Blizzard are working on new support heroes for the game as one of their “long-term focuses”. The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It&#x27;s not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

                              <span>Look, it&#x27;s all well and good wanting to get scared on Halloween or whatever. But some of us live the horror life every day of the year. We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there&#x27;s no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be &quot;Goth Christmas&quot;, but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine&#x27;s Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I&#x27;m determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday &quot;Goth Valentine&#x27;s&quot;. Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

                              <span>Putting together this list of the best early Black Friday SSD deals has proven trickier than expected, and not because Black Friday is still three weeks away. It’s because so many SSDs are subjected to dirty retailer tricks, mainly raising prices for the sole purpose of dropping them back down and calling it a “deal”. Naw, sir, not falling for that. What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there&#x27;s something for all kinds of PC builds.

                              <span>Horror games, you say? Feh, hardware can be scary too. One time I turned on a power supply and it literally went up in a cloud of smoke. Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

The Conservatorium Hotel, a five-star gaff that describes itself as the “living room of Amsterdam” on its website, hasn’t taken too kindly to being shot to pieces in digital form. Despite a name change, it’s still recognisably the same establishment.

This week&#x27;s pick is a lot less comprehensive than usual because I&#x27;m having some Twitter troubles which I hope are tech issues and not policy changes, but I guess we&#x27;ll see. Still! My eye was caught by some good and fancy things, including Halloweenie bits like an armed squirrel spooking people and lots of red fluids.

                              <span>I am, generally speaking, a horror fan, but this year for Halloween I&#x27;ve niched down on a particular topic and it has sort of accidentally taken me away from horror. Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they&#x27;re one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They&#x27;ve already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I&#x27;ve collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I&#x27;ve not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

Adam is a bruiser and launches with an unlockable skin modelled after his classic comic book look, which nabs players extra candy during the Halloween event running through to the end of Multiversus’s first season on November 15th. Today’s 1.05 update sees an arcade mode added to the game too, along with a new casual Growth Spurt mode.

                              <span>The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

This news comes as a surprise considering how devoted Cavill has seemed to the role over the years, quickly becoming a fan-favorite after the release of Season 1. He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth&#x27;s casting in the role. 
&quot;My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,&quot; Cavill&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>A new study reveals how purchasing a Kodi-powered streaming box changed the Internet and media consumption habits of US households.

Interestingly, their data show that the use of these boxes led to increased legal consumption through on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube.

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.

                              <span>I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts. The app is named for the Snap mechanic, w…</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a &quot;soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover.&quot; Using these tiles, you can create a &quot;unique story-multiverse&quot; at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

                              <span>Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you&#x27;re looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese version has been canceled due to the game&#x27;s violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan&#x27;s equivalent to the United States&#x27; ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here&#x27;s what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


&quot;The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you.&quot;

As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

This news comes from a Studio Spotlight blog post by Sony Interactive Entertainment in which the company interviews two London Studio heads: co-studio leaders Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders. The pair discuss their careers and jobs at London Studio, as well as what the team is working on. When asked about the studio&#x27;s next game, Saunders shares some new details about what to expect and the teaser image that you can see below. 
&quot;Our next project is an online co-op combat game, which as you can see here, is set in a modern fantasy London,&quot; Saunders says. &quot;The key thing about this is that it&#x27;s a PlayStation 5 title – it&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>Somerville, the mysterious sci-fi adventure game, finally has a release date and it’s only a few weeks away. The game arrives on November 15. 
The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December&#x27;s Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.</span>

                              <span>Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive Mini II, there&#x27;s a message that reads, &quot;In memory of Rieko Kodama.&quot; Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe&#x27;s tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, &quot;As you understand it. We respected her,&quot; confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama&#x27;s death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family&#x27;s privacy, Sega says. 
&quot;We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,&quot; Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama&#x27;s journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series&#x27; visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega&#x27;s Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama&#x27;s family.</span>

                              <span>Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio&#x27;s upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they&#x27;re leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line. 
Here is the statement in full: 
- Jamie Walker &amp; Sefton Hill

“Having worked with Jamie and Sefton as one of the founding members of the studio, I want to thank them for creating what I consider to be one of the best games development studios…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red announced that it was developing a new Cyberpunk game, multiple Witcher games, and a new IP. One of those Witcher games was given the codename &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; and CDPR called it a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool&#x27;s Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool&#x27;s Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur&#x27;s Gate III, and Outriders. 
We&#x27;re thrilled to reveal that, together with @Fools_Theory, we&#x27;re working on remaking …</span>
