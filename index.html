If there&#x27;s one thing Nintendo loves doing, it&#x27;s updating its Switch Online + Expansion Pack promotional trailer - highlighting all the new offerings.
Just yesterday, it&#x27;s shared a brand new trailer on its official YouTube channel, this time highlighting the new offerings in the N64 library such as GoldenEye 007, and also spotlighting the new Game Boy Advance library.

                              <span>A decidedly strange selection of esports
The International Olympics Committee has unveiled a range of games being featured in the Olympics Esports Series, at its official Olympic Esports Week, this year in June. Its selections are, frankly, pretty odd.
The IOC has occasionally flirted with the idea of including virtual events in its traditionally physical environment. In the past, it&#x27;s hosted the Olympic Virtual Series, with its 2021 event taking place ahead of the previously-postponed Tokyo Olympics. But there has historically been some resistance to mixing video games, with all its explosions and such, with the Olympic Games.
Enter the Olympic Esports Series 2023, which will culminate in live, in-person finals this June. It&#x27;s set to feature nine events: Archery, Baseball, Chess, Cycling,…</span>

If you’ve been holding off on diving into Sifu until its new expansion hits the internet waves, then your time is almost here. Sloclap has announced that they’ll be dropping the first DLC, the Arenas Expansion, on March 28, 2023.
The Arenas Expansion for Sifu bulks up the core game with an estimated 10 hours of content. This is the sum of 9 new areas, 45 new challenges, and 5 game modes. Among these modes are wave-based survival, time attack, king-of-the-hill style capture, targeted manhunt, and something called “performance mode.” It looks like “performance mode” is about avoiding damage. You can see for yourself in the new trailer.

Originally released in February 2022, Sifu became something of a beat-’em-up darling. If you haven’t played it before, Sifu is a game about what it’s like to be in your 30s. Time stops mattering, your body seems to age rapidly, and every failure is a new reason to feel obsolete. Mixed with this poignant theme is a tale about martial arts and vengeance.
Personally, I bounced off Sifu for basically no reason at all. I really need to circle back to it. I enjoyed what I played, but I think I got distracted by something neat. The Arenas DLC might be a good excuse to do so.
Sifu’s Arenas expansion will be a free upgrade to the base game, and it will release on March 28. It’s currently available on PS4, PS5, and PC. Alongside the DLC, the game will also become available on Steam and Xbox.

Humble Bundle has announced that now through March 8, 2023, you can load up on a ton of great games and contribute to a humanitarian cause at the same time. The Türkiye-Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle will net you 70 games and books for a minimum payment of $30 USD. Better yet, 100% of the proceeds are going to charity.
The Türkiye-Syria Earthquake Relief Bundle is in response to the recent earthquakes that happened in Türkiye and Syria. Thousands of lives have been lost in the disasters, and many more have been displaced. The proceeds from this bundle will be going to Direct Relief, International Medical Corps, and Save the Children to fund their humanitarian aid.
For your donation, you’ll be getting a banger selection of games. Among a high-quality slate of indie games like Backbone and Armello, there are some big hits like Ghostrunner, XCOM 2, and Euro Truck Simulator. There’s also the recent release Gotham Knights in there to sweeten the pot.
Aside from games, you’ll also get 10 volumes of Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples’ comic, Saga, and two books from the Starfinder TTRPG.
The Humble Bundles have long been a great budget way of grabbing games, but in devastating events like the Türkiye-Syria Earthquake, it’s a good way to draw attention to the cause. It’s also nice to see them put aside their own profit and push everything toward charities.

The Communication Workers of America (CWA) has filed charges against Activision, claiming the publisher violated workplace laws in its firing of two QA employees.
According to Kotaku, the dispute relates to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s push to bring workers back into the office, which has been met with resistance. Two QA testers allegedly expressed outrage using &quot;strong language,&quot; and disciplinary meetings were set up where both workers were fired.
The CWA argues that outbursts and strong language in the &quot;context of concerted activity&quot; was protected by the National Labor Relations Board until 2020, where it says the government &quot;systematically rolled back workers&#x27; right, including modifying the standard for determining whether e…</span>

                              <span>The galaxy is at peace
Eons ago, otherwise known as the NES and SNES era of gaming, people at my school were obsessed with the idea of &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s big three.&quot; What are the big three franchises that Nintendo has? In the days before Mario Kart, Pokémon, and Animal Crossing, all the kids could usually say Super Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. That&#x27;s what I would say too, though sometimes you&#x27;d find the one kid who had to be a contrarian by saying Donkey Kong.
While Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda are both still two of the top-tier franchises for Nintendo, it&#x27;s become clear to me that Metroid was never really as big as it might have seemed. It sold well, but not well enough to have skipped entire console generations without a new entry. And with the modern gaming landscape and Nintendo&#x27;s focus …</span>

                              <span>Telltale is shifting to avoid crunch and accommodate an engine shift
The Wolf Among Us 2 is being delayed out of this year. Telltale Games confirms that the sequel will be moving into 2024, as the team makes an effort to both avoid crunch and move from Unreal Engine 4 to 5.
Speaking to IGN, Telltale Games CEO Jamie Ottilie attributes the choice to a number of reasons. Part of those is concerns over burnout: &quot;I&#x27;ve done [crunch], and I don&#x27;t want to do it again, and it&#x27;s not fair to ask it,&quot; Ottilie said.
&quot;Making games is difficult and they need time to be right,&quot; Ottilie told IGN. &quot;And it doesn&#x27;t do any of us any good to ship something that&#x27;s not ready.&quot;
The other concern is a shift from Unreal Engine 4 to 5. According to the CEO, many on the team feel its worth the extra work, but he does say it entails redoing &quot;quite a bit of work&quot; that was already finished.
Rather than crunch or ship an unfinished project, Telltale will work to finish The Wolf Among Us 2 on its new schedule. The new series is episodic, like its predecessor; but unlike the first Wolf Among Us, it&#x27;s being made all at once, so the whole run will be finished by the time Episode 1 rolls out.

A wolf in the wings
While that might be disappointing for those hoping for some investigative fantasy stories this year, it sounds like it could be a good thing for the team working on The Wolf Among Us 2. More breathing room and no looming crunch overhead will hopefully make bringing this legend back into the spotlight easier to do.
The resurrected Telltale is still rolling out games, though. The Expanse: A Telltale Series is due out this year, in collaboration with Deck Nine Games. And hey, with all that extra time, it&#x27;s a good excuse to brush up on the first Wolf Among Us if you haven&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s pretty darn good.

                              <span>Lightfall truly has arrived
It&#x27;s been a huge week for the Destiny 2 team at Bungie. On February 28 the latest expansion, Lightfall, was released and the player base came out to support in its masses. Not only did Destiny 2: Lightfall see massive numbers and a surge in concurrent players, but it broke its own previous Steam record.
As shown on SteamDB, the record for the number of concurrent players on Steam prior to February 28&#x27;s release of Lightfall was around 292,000. This happened with 2019&#x27;s release of the Shadowkeep expansion, which was the first major DLC to be released independently by Bungie after acquiring publishing rights for the series from Activision earlier that year. 2022&#x27;s The Witch Queen came in close, but Lightfall saw a record-breaking 316,750 concurrent Steam players logging in to discover the secrets of the newly discovered city of Neomuna.
It&#x27;s unclear what precisely drew so many Guardians into the game at once with the launch of Lightfall. Is it the new Strand subclass? Perhaps it&#x27;s the new storyline detailing Calus and his Shadow Legion&#x27;s invasion of Neomuna in search of the Veil? Maybe it&#x27;s just hundreds of thousands of people excited to continue with the seasonal storyline, which sees Mara Sov team up with Guardians to face Xivu Arath&#x27;s impending war. Whatever the reason, the record has been smashed for Destiny 2 by over 10,000 players.
Our end begins

Destiny 2: Lightfall is the penultimate installment in the Light and Dark saga of the game, which will be concluded with 2024&#x27;s The Final Shape. Bungie recently released a mammoth blog post detailing the year ahead, and it is expected that players will hear more about the future of Destiny within the next 12 months as we draw closer to the next expansion&#x27;s release.

                              <span>There&#x27;s still more work to be done
A few weeks ago, The Pokemon Company teased a new patch for Scarlet &amp; Violet, which was slated for &quot;the end of February.&quot; Well now that date has come and gone, and the full patch notes are now live on Nintendo&#x27;s official site. Let&#x27;s run through a few of the alterations to the previous patch notes.
Performance is still rough, but you can buy the DLC now
One obvious addition to the patch notes in this final pass is the existence of DLC. While that was kept under lock and key before the Pokemon Day presentation, the cat is out of the bag now, and we know that there are two DLC expansions (parts 1 and 2) slated for release in the fall and winter of 2023.
To that end, the patch added the ability to buy them in-game, and unlock specific bonuses immediately.

                              <span>We Are The Game Creators
Back in September 2022, we reported that long-time BlazBlue producer Toshimici Mori was stepping away from Arc System Works, a company that he had served for just shy of two decades — And it seems that Mori is now ready to get back into the thick of the action, with the establishment of a brand new developer, Studio Flare.
Based in Gotanda, Tokyo, Studio Flare has been co-founded by Mori and the former executive vice-president of Marvelous, Toshinori Aoki, with a healthy dose of financial funding from Chinese commerce conglomerate Netease. Aoki will serve as president and CEO of Studio Flare, with Mori serving as vice president and head producer. The studio has a long list of openings, with roles for artists, engineers, coders, and server maintenance managers.

&quot;With knowledge and expertise from their past projects, Studio Flare will deliver new game experiences to global audiences. The company also has received support from NetEase Games, the gaming division of NetEase, Inc.,&quot; reads a press release. &quot;Studio Flare has [[the intent] to create games with an edgy feel that bring excitement to hardcore gamers. We will start developing original games for console platforms, with a small but highly talented team based in our studio in Gotanda, Tokyo.&quot;
For those familiar with Mori&#x27;s work, the specific use of &quot;edgy&quot; in the press release is quite amusing, as Mori&#x27;s oeuvre has frequently featured dark, cringe-cool, super-sexualized characters. While it is fantastic to see Mori back in the game and in the driving seat, one can&#x27;t help but wonder what fate this leaves for his trademark series, BlazBlue, which stays with Arc System Works, and will hopefully not get lost among that studio&#x27;s catalog of releases.
You can check out Studio Flare&#x27;s brand-new website — complete with obligatory shades and leather jacket shot — right here.

Destiny 2: Lightfall is out, and like many Destiny expansions over the years (dating all the way back to the original game), the phrase &quot;expansion&quot; can be applied very loosely to many facets of the actual release. Let&#x27;s take a look at where it falls short.
As an aside there will be no major story spoilers here, other than broad themes.

The Lightfall story is abrupt, and doesn&#x27;t really explain anything
All roads seem to be leading to The Final Shape expansion, which will be dropping in 2024. Well, a lot of roads have been heading there previously, but Lightfall is more like a detour.
Much like many infamous mystery box shows, Lightfall is content wit…</span>

                              <span>She&#x27;s going to be yours, forever, and ever, and ever
Wonderful news for lovers everywhere: Good Smile Co has opened pre-orders on a brand new addition to its Pop-Up Parade pop culture figure range, sculpted after the achingly adorable Monika, the heart-rending star of visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club.
Standing a little over seven inches in height, Monika is dressed in her iconic school uniform and two-tone shoes, posed in a welcoming, coy manner and carrying the pen with which she will write you many a sweet nothing. A welcome addition to any desktop, Monika&#x27;s loving gaze will inspire you while you work, watch T.V., make calls, read, cook, eat, dress, and sleep... Especially when you sleep.
Talk about security! Monika will watch over you, now and always. Forever.

Good Smile Co.&#x27;s Pop-Up Parade brand is a range of static, affordable figures, provided without articulation or accessories, but offering a cheaper alternative to the more prestige Figma range. I happen to own a couple of Pop-Up Parade figures myself — such as rice queen Sakuna — and they are nicely sculpted, subtly colored, and make for a fine addition to your work desk and/or windowsill without breaking the bank.
Doki Doki Literature Club&#x27;s Monika is available to pre-order now from the Good Smile Co. website and other merch retailers, priced at ¥4,800, (roughly $35 USD), not including any shipping charges. Monika is expected to show up at your door in August 2023. I hope that you&#x27;ll be very happy together.
You better be.

The stylish rhythm-action game Hi-Fi Rush is breaking out the camera. A new update today adds Photo Mode to Hi-Fi Rush, letting players snap shots of their favorite moments and characters.
Xbox Series X|S and PC users can download the update today and start capturing their favorite moments, whether that&#x27;s a posed cast shot or an active snap of Chai slamming bots with his guitar. Once the game&#x27;s updated, the Photo Mode can be accessed directly through the in-game menu.
What options do you have? Well, it looks like you can use plenty of frames, as well as pose characters and add filters. It&#x27;s got the bells and whistles you&#x27;d want from a Photo Mode, from the look of it.
https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1630968954750369800
That said, it&#x27;s a Photo Mode for Hi-Fi Rush, a game that&#x27;s all about style and has some excellent character designs. It looks like that thematic drive carries into the photo options too. I love the ability to tool around with color settings and poses, and create some really vibrant screenshots.
Picture rush
Alongside today&#x27;s Photo Mode addition, Hi-Fi Rush also issued a patch addressing some issues. This includes some &quot;UE4 Fatal Error&quot; issues that had been popping up, due to various reasons. Some progress blockers and other annoyances have been tuned up too, and even the stick and trigger dead zone calculation has been adjusted.
Hi-Fi Rush was an early and pleasant surprise for 2023, adding onto the pile of projects that have emphasized Game Pass&#x27; strengths. It&#x27;s nice to see Tango Gameworks continue to add onto it, and in a way that feels very fitting to what players would still want out of this experience.

Purveyor of (often romantic) visual novels, Winter Wolves, has launched a Kickstarter for their latest concoction, Save the World. They are seeking €4000 for the project, and… oh, they already met it. Good for them.
Save the World appears to be a yuri visual novel. The Kickstarter doesn’t explicitly say that, but all I see are women, and the two mentioned romantic options are both lesbian. It involves one such woman being abducted by aliens. Their leader, Xen, explains that they aren’t invaders, but rather they travel about saving worlds and asks for the protagonist, Ekiya’s, advice on what’s ailing Earth. Her response is about the unbalanced distribution of wealth, and the aliens follow through by simply eliminating a lot of rich people.
Boobs and eating the rich. I am captivated.

I find the narrative crux of Save the World to be quite interesting. It has you consider if, given the opportunity, you would use an alien race&#x27;s technological force to address the world’s problems. How far would you go? Would it even be worth it? Maybe the world’s problems are humanity’s alone to fix, or perhaps a drastic — possibly violent — course correction is the only way to save it.
Meanwhile, you also have the option to romance two of the characters. Because there’s no better way to unwind from a moral quandary than with a little grind and bump. Stretch goals include more CG scenes and extra outfits, some of which are sexy or completely explicit (another kind of sexy).
I’ve enjoyed a fair few of Winter Wolves’ previous visual novels, but with this sort of thing, it mostly comes down to the writer and artist.
Save the World’s Kickstarter is going on right now and will continue through to March 23, 2023. The development is expected to take one year, with Save the Earth becoming available on PC in March 2024.

                              <span>Reopening the Chronicle
Last year&#x27;s The DioField Chronicle was an interesting look at the tactics genre, and now in 2023, there&#x27;s more of it in store. The DioField Chronicle is getting a free update in less than a week, adding more features and content to the Chronicle.
The new update for The DioField Chronicle arrives on March 5 at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET. It is free for all owners of The DioField Chronicle, so no need to purchase a separate piece of DLC either.
https://twitter.com/DiofieldGame/status/1630893162976751618
This update includes a new story scenario, dubbed &quot;Waltaquin&#x27;s Story.&quot; For those who have already played through the game, you can imagine how venturing into Waltaquin&#x27;s side might be interesting to see.
Additionally, the update is adding a Very Hard difficulty and Extra Mode difficulty, the latter for New Game+ mode. Also, a new weapon type for Magic Tomes is being added as well. Hopefully, that includes some new abilities and skills for users of Tomes.
You&#x27;ll need to reach chapter 6 to access all of this, it seems. Story reasons are one thing, but it will probably also help to be familiar with The DioField Chronicle before tackling some of its newer challenges too.
A new chapter
Of the many, many RPGs that Square Enix released last fall, The DioField Chronicle is an odd one. But there&#x27;s something about its fresh take on strategy and interesting world that&#x27;s kept it in my mind, months after rolling credits.
So yes, I&#x27;m happy to see this game getting a free update and some post-launch additions. Waltaquin&#x27;s side of the story felt like it was left hanging for future potential, and I&#x27;m curious to see where it goes, and if any of this hints at a follow-up. I&#x27;d certainly like to see The DioField Chronicle carry forward into another entry.
The free update for The DioField Chronicle arrives on March 5.

Awesome news for fans of Berzerk Studios&#x27; violent, old-school adventure Infernax — A brand new update, coming this spring, will add new content to the 8-bit slasher, including an all-new character, and an exciting co-op multiplayer mode. Best of all, the Deux or Die update will be free to all players!
Infernax: Deux or Die will introduce the character of Cervul the Squire, a young, eager, up-and-coming knight who proves more than handy with his dual-headed axe, able to lay waste to the denizens of Hell at close range and at long distances. Cervul is also able to perform useful buffs on himself and his allies, tipping the scales of war a little further in the player&#x27;s favor. The lad has a heart of gold, and it remains to be seen whether the horrors of…</span>

Ravenage Games has announced that Bureau Bravin’s minimalist resource management game Masterplan Tycoon is set to unravel on March 9.
Masteplan Tycoon has you gathering resources and processing them into products to be sold. The big twist here is that all the bells and whistles have been sliced off in favor of more simplistic visuals that bring to mind the type of flowcharts you’d find in your employee training manual or in boardroom presentations. Pushing to further the minimalistic approach, there is no punishment for not getting things exactly right.

Some people really love making flowcharts, but there isn’t always a need for them. Masterplan Tycoon sort of feels like a solution to this. It provides abundant need for flowcharts, which should be exceedingly satisfying for the flowchart minded.
I feel like the minimalistic graphics style has to make it extraordinarily difficult for a small project to stand out, however. Video games are often about piling gloss and hanging ornaments from very simple abstractions. It’s always an interesting experiment to remove those dressings to reveal the naked skeleton beneath. A lot of the most addictive games have stripped the unnecessary fat, and instead replaced it with the constant feeling of progression. Look at, say, Vampire Survivors or basically any game in the clicker sub-genre.
You’ll be able to set up your flowcharts in Masterplan Tycoon on March 9 on PC. If you’d like a taste right now, there’s a demo available on Steam.

Publishers XSeed Games and Marvelous Europe have secured the license to bring high fantasy RPG Trinity Trigger to western audiences — PlayStation and Nintendo Switch editions of the 2022 release will launch in April, with a new PC port scheduled to arrive on Steam in May.
Developed by Three Rings, Trinity Trigger is a typical JRPG tale of Gods and Monsters, as well as the brave-hearted little people that set out to save their own worlds. It follows the story of the Warrior of Chaos, Cyan, who is fated to do battle with his counterpart, the Warrior of Order. Looking for an alternate route to choosing his own destiny, Cyan sets forth on a grand adventure across the continent of Trinitia, accompanied by his friends, Elise and Zantis. While …</span>

Canadian developer The Coalition has opened a vacancy for a Senior Gameplay Designer, specifically citing that the successful applicant will be working on a new project in the Gears of War franchise. The vacancy, which went live yesterday, was spotted by the news outlet GameRant.
While there are no clues as to whether the project is a straight sequel, a remaster, or some form of spin-off, The Coalition is looking for applicants with experience in &quot;3CS&quot;, (Character, Camera, Controls), which certainly suggests an over-the-shoulder third-person affair. The job listing coincides with recent rumors that the studio had been pushed to can two unannounced games purely to focus on the lucrative and hugely popular shooter franchise.
https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s&#x3D;20
Giant Bomb writer Jeff Grubb has previously suggested that the next title from The Coalition will be Gears 6, which will be the first sequel since the release of Gears 5, which launched on PC and Xbox platforms in the fall of 2019.
&quot;This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit,&quot; said Grubb on the Game Mess Mornings Show. &quot;The studio is now going to move on fully to Gears 6. I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but, definitely, that will be their next game.&quot;
Still, regardless of whatever title The Coalition has on deck, it is clearly still in its early production stages. As such, fans of the franchise — whether pro-Gears or pro-Horde — will still have quite the wait ahead before they will find themselves revving their Lancers and donning their stomping boots once again.

Electronic Arts has reportedly fired the testing team for its blockbuster hero shooter Apex Legends — According to a report by Kotaku, the publisher released the entirety of its Baton Rouge-based testing team — believed to be some 200 workers — in an &#x27;out of the blue&#x27; Zoom call held yesterday.
News of the layoffs came suddenly when affected employees took to social media, understandably stunned and upset at the event. According to other former workers, speaking anonymously with Kotaku, the team was called to an urgent, mandatory call with contracting agency Magnit Global at 08:00 on Tuesday morning, where they were informed that the entire Baton Rogue Apex Legends QA team was being disbanded, effective immediately.

It&#x27;s finally here. Lightfall has been released for Guardians worldwide and with it comes the new Darkness subclass, Strand. The campaign reveals a lot of information about this mysterious new power, and Osiris is present to hold our hands and help us uncover its true capabilities. Some Guardians may remember Beyond Light, where the full power of Stasis wasn&#x27;t readily available and some steps needed to be completed before we could wield it.
Strand is no different, and there are some steps to follow to unlock the Strand subclass in Destiny 2. It&#x27;s reasonably straightforward though, and it&#x27;s an exciting adventure to set out on. In addition to being a devastating offensive tool, Strand can be used to create a grappling hook for ultra-fast world traversal, to give Gu…</span>

                              <span>Older CDPR titles won&#x27;t be getting the same optimizations, though
If you&#x27;ve wanted to explore Night City on the go around your own city, then there&#x27;s some good news: Cyberpunk 2077 has been officially Verified as Steam Deck compatible.
What does that mean, exactly? Well, the Verified system is a way for Valve to acknowledge which games are most compatible with its computer handheld, the Steam Deck. While many games can run, not all of them will run well. Some might have some issues with controller support, or new hitches introduced when trying to operate on the Deck.
Verified acknowledges that a game passes a certain set of standards, as outlined by Valve. This includes controller support, performance, appropriate input icons, and legible text on the in-game interface.
So while many Edgerunners might have already been tinkering around with Cyberpunk 2077 on Valve&#x27;s handheld device, the game is now officially approved for the Steam Deck.

A new cyber deck
This guarantee of decent operation makes it a little bit easier for those who don&#x27;t want to fool around with settings and options to simply play a game on their Steam Deck. It&#x27;s a pretty good upside for anyone wanting to reacquaint themselves ahead of a possible expansion release this year, too.
While Cyberpunk 2077 got the Steam Deck treatment, though, older games in CD Projekt&#x27;s back catalog aren&#x27;t so lucky. This marks the third of CD Projekt&#x27;s games to become Steam Deck Verified, alongside The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales. In today&#x27;s announcement, though,  CD Projekt says there is no plan to provide additional Steam Deck optimizations for &quot;our legacy titles.&quot; Sad to say, I think this knocks out any Assassins of Kings hopes. But at least the Edgerunners know they can safely plug into a Steam Deck run of Cyberpunk 2077 now.

Though the JRPG has remained the de facto king of the RPG space for the last few decades, one could argue that the popular genre would never have existed were it not for DRPGs. What started in eons past with titles like Ultima and aimed to translate a traditional D&amp;D gameplay experience to the screen has given way to more approachable dungeon-crawlers like Etrian Odyssey and Demon Gaze. In 2018, Nippon Ichi tried its hand at the subgenre with the enjoyable Labyrinth Of Refrain: Coven Of Dusk and it’s now opted to follow up on that experiment with Labyrinth of Galleria: The Moon Society. Though it’s clearly designed for a relatively narrow audience, there’s a lot to love about Labyrinth of Galleria.
Labyrinth of Galleria places you in the role of Eureka, a bright-eyed young girl responding to a job posting that sees her visiting a sketchy abandoned manor in the woods. Here, she is welcomed by the witchy Madame Marta, who quickly bonds her with a cute green ghost that Eureka names ‘Fantie’ and prompts her to use her spooky new friend to explore the vast labyrinth below Galleria Manor in search of powerful magical artifacts that the manor’s mysterious owner desires. No human can enter the labyrinth and return unharmed, so Marta teaches her how to use Fantie’s powers to imbue various puppets with life and direct them to explore the dungeon on her behalf. Eureka thus sets out on a vicarious quest into the depths below, while slowly learning more about her eccentric employers.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.
Today, both Jim and Kate nominate Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, the first foray into 3D for everyone&#x27;s favourite courtroom-set franchise...

Fortunately, Heart Core has today got the start flag at the ready as it has announced that the boss rush title will be blasting onto Switch on 29th March.
Alongside this date reveal, the developer also shared a new trailer which can be found above and gives a slightly better idea of the game&#x27;s story as well as introducing us to the mildly foul-mouthed robot cat companion, Kat-Kit.

Publisher Spike Chunsoft has today announced that it will be bringing exercise back to the Switch as Fitness Circuit powers its way onto the console on 26th May.
Remember back in the early days of the global pandemic when everyone turned to Switch games like Ring Fit Adventure to maintain some sense of daily exercise? It served as a nice reminder that the console is not all about playing from the sofa in docked mode or in handheld from bed (though it is great for that too), but it can also get us moving.

Last week saw the launch of the Fractal update in No Man&#x27;s Sky which brought additions such as new ships, expeditions and even gyro controls to the Switch. Now, Hello Games has released the follow-up patch to solve any issues with the new content.
The ver. 4.12 update is mainly focussed on sorting out bugs that arose with the latest additions to the game. Many of these were focussed on consoles outside of the Switch, though the Nintendo version will see some of the fixes come its way.

With only a few short weeks left now until the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for good, you would be forgiven for thinking that the outlets&#x27; range of new content would have halted too. You would, however, be wrong as it has just been confirmed that a brand new title in the Silver Falls series — Silver Falls: Gaiden Deathly Delusion Destroyers — will be launching on the North American 3DS eShop on 9th March.
The latest release from Sungrand Studios will come bundled with another unique title, Silver Falls: Ruby River, and will be available for the single payment of $16.99.

BROK the InvestiGator gets right to the point: you begin the game in a burning room. You naturally start pointing and clicking to solve a simple puzzle. This leads to another puzzle: Alligator PI Brok urgently exclaims, “I need to get past that door!” Before your grey matter cogs can even get a-whirring, a dialogue box tells you to press &#x27;X&#x27; to activate Action Mode. With a good bit of Double Dragon-style – or should we say Double Crocodile-style! – button mashing, the door puzzle is “solved”. So Cowcat Games’ cards go straight onto the table: Brok the InvestiGator is a point-and-click, but sometimes you just punch stuff to smithereens. But does it have an ace up its sleeve?
Brok is the second game to be developed and self-published by indie shop Cowcat Games. The first was Demetrios, another point-and-click adventure, first released six years earlier in 2016, which arrived on Switch in 2018. Based in a small town in the south of France, the company is a one-person operation, making this second game under their belt all the more impressive.

The latest update is now here for the Nintendo Switch Online app for iOS and Android devices.
Amongst the usual tweaks, this latest version expands on the service&#x27;s Splatoon 3 content, most notably adding the option to have game widgets on your device&#x27;s lock screen. This means that you can now check the in-game stage schedule without even having to unlock your phone — pretty neat.

We last heard about POST VOID — the grotesque, psychedelic FPS with more than a little DOOM inspiration sprinkled in — back in August of last year when the game was set for a September 2022 release. That, obviously, did not happen, but publisher Super Rare Originals has now announced that we will finally be able to dive into the void on 16th March. That&#x27;s only two weeks away!
Much like the classic FPS games that inspired it, POST VOID is all about making your way through a series of procedurally-generated levels as quickly as you can, shooting anything that stands in your way. One look at the gameplay in the above trailer and you will see that this title from developers YCJY is wild. Expect gory kills, crazy colours and a hefty dose of shredding rock thrown in for good measure.

With the recent release of patch v1.2.0 for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the games have also launched a new Tera Raid event featuring brand new &#x27;Paradox Pokémon&#x27; Walking Wake and Iron Leaves.
However, it appears that a rather egregious bug has raised its head in the wake of the release (thanks, Automaton), and players who encounter it have reportedly been blocked from catching the new Pokémon altogether. According to the Pokémon Company itself, players who challenge the new raid without updating their game to v1.2.0 will instead find themselves face-to-face with an egg. Seriously.

The Japanese publisher and developer has announced an update next week on 6th March will be adding a new scenario &quot;Waltaquin&#x27;s Story&quot;, a new &quot;Very Hard&quot; difficulty, a new weapon type &quot;Magic Tome&quot; and a New Game+ &quot;Extra Mode&quot; (thanks, Gematsu).

Nintendo Switch Sports added golf to the mix late last year, and while it&#x27;s seemingly got nothing else major planned in the near future, it&#x27;s still being updated on a regular basis with some small patches.
The second update of the year (Version 1.4.0) makes some changes and adjustments, and also includes &quot;several&quot; fixes to improve the overall gameplay experience. Players can now collect items they may have missed before, and will unlock special crowns when achieving &#x27;A Rank&#x27; in each sport.

Last week, Microsoft put pen to paper, announcing its 10-year commitment to bring the Call of Duty franchise to Nintendo platforms is now legally binding.
Microsoft president Brad Smith followed this up by mentioning how the tech giant would ensure the series works exactly as people expect on other platforms, and now Microsoft Gaming CEO and Xbox boss Phil Spencer has elaborated on this during an official &#x27;Xbox On&#x27; interview.

                              <span>Sony has announced a new collaborative initiative called PlayStation PlayMakers. The console giant will partner up with celebrity fans of the brand to “celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation” by creating unique experiences for players. One of those famous names is NBA superstar LeBron James, who helped design a limited-edition PlayStation 5 accessories.
The special console plates and DualSense 5 controller were co-designed by James and will release in select countries. The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron&#x27;s thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. 
Other big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku. The initiative feels similar to McDonald&#x27;s recent push of celebrity-branded menu items, so who knows what to expect from these names and others in the future.

Editors Note: a previous version of the article incorrectly stated that Sony revealed a LeBron James PS5 console instead of console accessories. We&#x27;ve updated the article with the correction.</span>

                              <span>Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.
Telltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.
With such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve done [crunch], and I don&#x27;t want to do it again, and it&#x27;s not fair to ask it,&quot; Ottilie tells IGN. &quot;You can&#x27;t plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don&#x27;t want to burn out our good people.”
The Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year.

The game was revealed during last year’s Gamescom and centers on players manipulating sand to explore and survive in a fantastical desert world.  
The game supports single-player and two-player co-op and takes place in a massive sand-covered world filled with monsters and gods. You’ll take them down using shape-shifting weapons born out of the sand and other customizable magical abilities. You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer from Gamescom 2022, and a batch of new screenshots, below.

                              <span>With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. 
Diablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…</span>

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off more than 200 quality assurance testers at its Baton Rouge office in Lousiana. 
This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that EA laid off these workers, who worked primarily on the publisher&#x27;s battle royale Apex Legends, during a surprise Zoom call yesterday. The publication reports that its three sources were able to confirm the news, which began making rounds on Twitter when both current and former QA testers at the Lousiana office began to share what they had learned. 
EA just fired its entire Baton Rouge studio, which is essentially their entire Apex Legends QA staff.
February 28, 2023
Kotaku reports that around 8 a.m. CT, QA testers were invited to an unscheduled but mandatory Zoom call with Magnit Global, which is the contract agency that manages the workers. It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was &quot;disbanded,&quot; according to Kotaku. 
The publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as &quot;part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that&#x27;s been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.&quot; Be sure to check out Kotaku&#x27;s write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more.

                              <span>A new thing for RPS in 2023 is the RPS Game Club, a kind of monthly book club for games where we pick a game to play each month, write some cool things about it, and have a big all liveblog discussion with you lot, our readers, at the end of it. It&#x27;s a project I&#x27;ve been wanting to get off the ground for some time now, and finally, the Treehouse Game Club doors have been busted open... and there&#x27;s some toe-tapping guitar music coming from inside? That&#x27;s right, we&#x27;re playing Hi-Fi Rush as our first RPS Game Club game, and we hope you&#x27;ll join us on this month-long musical journey.

Such is the case with the Ryzen 7 7700X, the middle child of the Zen 4 lineup and an absolutely beastly performer when it comes to gaming thanks to its full-fat eight-core, one-CCD design. This chip launched at $399 but is now $100 cheaper thanks to a discount code at Newegg, where you can pick up the 7700X for $298.99 when you use code BTSCP2655 at the checkout.

                              <span>“I was deranged,” says Half-Life writer Marc Laidlaw of his decision to publish the plot of Episode 3 as fanfiction. “I was living on an island, totally cut off from my friends and creative community of the last couple decades, I was completely out of touch and had nobody to talk me out of it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” 


Laidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”

It&#x27;s a delicate art that warrants close consideration. It also warrants some good examples, which brings us to ΔV: Rings Of Saturn. Which, as it gets closer to release, I&#x27;m going to be nice to and call either Delta V or Rings Of Saturn. Even though Triangle Vee Colon Rings is more fun.
It&#x27;s also fun, having played it, to keep up with how it’s doing in early access, not just because I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it take off, but because its dev has spent the last few years writing delightful patch notes in the style of in-world news bulletins.

The open-world RPG has always been playable on the portable machine, but it’s now Steam Deck verified - meaning Valve have tested it and used their almighty wisdom to determine it’ll run without a hitch.

This news comes from a report by Kotaku which says the layoffs happened over a last-minute Zoom call, according to three of their sources. EA later confirmed the news, calling the layoffs part of their “ongoing global strategy” to expand the “distribution of our Apex Legends testing team.”

                              <span>One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it&#x27;s even for the right reasons. Perhaps I&#x27;d spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.
Or, more likely, I&#x27;d witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island&#x27;s flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I&#x27;d just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn&#x27;t looking.
Sons Of The Forest&#x27;s great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player&#x27;s trust until they&#x27;re ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.

                              <span>I&#x27;m still not entirely sure if I&#x27;m playing Phantom Brigade right. According to its internal clock, battles usually take less than a minute. That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you&#x27;re shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.
In practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There&#x27;s probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that&#x27;s taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I&#x27;m supposed to be blasting through without a care.
I am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.

                              <span>Over the last few weeks I&#x27;ve spent a number of hours with Honkai: Star Rail&#x27;s closed beta, and it certainly seems that MiHoYo&#x27;s upcoming free-to-play RPG is hoping to capture a similar audience to Genshin Impact. Star Rail&#x27;s turn-based battles and JRPG leanings might be a bit of a departure from Genshin&#x27;s open-world adventuring, but it&#x27;s definitely, 100%, without a doubt, anime as heck. Oh, and very gacha. There&#x27;s a lot of currencies. So many currencies. Still, I think it&#x27;s shaping up to be a decent time.

                              <span>I’m a sucker for well-hidden video game easter eggs, from Psychonauts 2’s strange mpreg cutscene to the ability to play as a baby in Mount &amp; Blade 2, they&#x27;re all great they’re great. But it’s all too easy to walk past easter eggs without knowing they were even there. I’ve probably waved off multiple fun secrets, mistaking them for lore I didn’t understand or a questline I haven’t gotten to. So, my pea-sized brain enjoyed this video of game designer Steve Lee interviewing the devs behind Skyrim and Fallout as they reveal some dev secrets behind those games - including a cool egg.

                              <span>I know we’ve been bleating on about PC system requirements lately, but the spec demands of Kerbal Space Program 2 also demand a special, visibly uncomfortable mention. This game, fresh into early access and the sequel to one that needed a mere 512GB of VRAM, lists the formidable RTX 3080 among its recommended hardware. That’s a £600-plus graphics card, and for the bare minimum of Low quality at 1080p? That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. 


Consternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that &quot;the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec.&quot; Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.

                              <span>I have, genuinely, been trying to get plants for my office area (desk in the corner of the living room) for like nine months now. If my need for plants were a child, it would have been born. I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn&#x27;t told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.
I know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I&#x27;ve just realised the name is a pun, too.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Plasma, a spacey physics-driven engineering game that lets players build a variety of robot friendos, useful machines, and generally wild contraptions. Plasma comes from Patrick Corrieri and Marco Bancale, who have previously worked on the Poly Bridge series and the tense Kingdom games. Their new creative engineering sim is heading into early access on March 30th, and I can’t wait to see what people make.

                              <span>There are plenty of great games based on books, but I’ve never seen an adaptation as unconventional as The Forest Cathedral, a dramatic reimagining of Rachel Carson’s science book from the ‘60s, Silent Spring. Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation.

                              <span>Aside from the newly added PvP colosseums, Elden Ring has been relatively quiet  after selling a gazillion copies and winning every game of the year award in existence (except for the coveted RPS one.) Fans have been clamouring for DLC and you’d expect a big expansion announcement to coincide with the game’s first anniversary - February 25th - but developer FromSoftware chose to celebrate the mega-RPG’s birthday three days later - this morning. In a Twitter post, FromSoftware announced Elden Ring’s first expansion called Shadow Of The Erdtree.

Octopath Traveler, and its follow-up Octopath Traveler 2, both start off with an interesting but challenging narrative format: take eight adventurers, tell their origin stories, and weave their fates together into a greater anthology. These eight heroes grow into their own in their stories and then, once established in their own right, join together to fight the ultimate challenge awaiting them. Conceptually, it&#x27;s powerful. In reality, it can be a delicate dance.
For a full disclosure, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the first Octopath Traveler. A soaring soundtrack and gorgeous presentation couldn&#x27;t lift the stories high enough to make me want to see things through to the finale myself. So I&#x27;m not sure what it was that drew me in,…</span>

Square Enix Holdings has announced that it is merging with developer Luminous Productions — the studio behind spellbound adventure Forspoken. The two companies will forge together on May 1, 2023.
&quot;The merger is part of [Square Enix] efforts to further bolster the competitive prowess of the Group’s development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy,&quot; said Square Enix Holdings in a brief statement. &quot;Square Enix Co.

Publisher CyGames and developer Arc System Works have released several updates pertaining to Granblue Fantasy: Versus Rising, the expanded edition of the studios&#x27; gorgeous anime fighter, initially launched on PlayStation and PC back in the winter of 2020.
Perhaps first and foremost, we received a super cute teaser trailer for a brand-new DLC character, Anila. The... erm... &quot;buxom&quot; lass is an all-round fighter, who will combine rushdown and zoning-based fighting methods — afforded vast reach thanks to her trusty polearm while being aided and abetted by her flock of Divine Sheep. Quite honestly, I think this a wonderful idea for a fighting game character. You think you&#x27;ve seen everything, and then ArcSys is just like &quot;I dunno... Magic Sexy Shepherd?&quot;
Say hi to Anila in …</span>

Last Man Gaming has announced that their breathtaking simulator, Forklift Extreme, will be making the drop to PC on March 16, 2023. Available as Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition, this is the first time the title has become available on a platform aside from the Switch and mobile.
If the name didn’t give it away, Forklift Extreme is a physics-based forklift simulator. Using “ultra-realistic physics” to bring this favored pastime to life, you can finally live out your dreams as a person who moves things with a vehicle. Or, as the press release puts it, “lifelike driver physics for an immersive experience like never before.” Okay!
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_366251&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;640&quot;] Image via Last Man Gaming[/caption]
The Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition includes all the game’s DLC. There’s one where you move furniture and another with giant pumpkins. That’s cool. Pumpkins are cool.
Real talk, though. The press release email opened with the one-person developer saying they’re just a “big fan of physics simulation games.” You know what? I’m a big fan of programmer-driven games. Reviews of the Switch version aren’t bad but aren’t spectacular, but maybe the package is a lot more enticing with all the DLC included. The critics at least seem to agree that it’s exactly what it says on the box.
I was driven to write about this because my dad is a yard foreman at a lumberyard in my hometown. A big part of his job is driving a forklift. I wonder if there’s an option in Forklift Extreme for racing wheels, because I’d love to see how he would do in a series of challenges like this.
Forklift Extreme is available on Switch, iOS, and Android. Forklift Extreme: Deluxe Edition is coming to Steam on March 16, 2023.

Last week&#x27;s Sony State of Play presentation was notable for its gameplay reveal of the final three characters joining the launch roster of Capcom&#x27;s great-looking punchfest, Street Fighter 6 — And alongside the ever-popular Cammy and cutesy new gal Lily, we also saw the return of a true Street Fighter veteran, the wrestler with an iron body and a golden heart: Zangief.
Hailing from Russia, Zangief made his debut as one of the iconic eight playable characters in 1991&#x27;s groundbreaking Street Fighter II: The World Warriors. As the key grappler for that game, Zangief made a name for himself with his violent array of throws, dizzying airborne headbutt, and one of the most famous moves in fighting game history, the Spinning Piledriver. Zangief has since appe…</span>

Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio working on development hell sequel Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, is facing another setback with the departure of managing director, Guillaume Carmona, who has reportedly left the company amidst an investigation into the studio&#x27;s work environment.
According to a report from Kotaku, Ubisoft Montpellier is currently under investigation by the Inspection du Travail, who became involved with the studio after an &quot;unprecedented number of developers [began] experiencing burnout and going on sick leave&quot;.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s-a-go slightly earlier than expected
Universal and Illumination are moving up the premiere date of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The animated film is now hitting theaters on April 5 in several markets including the U.S., up from April 7.
While it hits two day earlier in the U.S., other regions will still have to wait a bit longer into April and May; Japan, specifically, will see The Super Mario Bros. Movie debut on April 28.

Nothing&#x27;s been indicated as to why the date shifted. But hey, that&#x27;s a little bit of Mario slightly earlier than expected.
Warp pipe to the future
Before April arrives, we&#x27;re due for at least one more blast of information about the upcoming film. Nintendo has confirmed that the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie will air on March 9 in a special movie-focused Direct. The company also says no game information will be included in this Direct, so bad news for anyone hoping for a Mario game to pop up out of the warp pipe.
And honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how much more I need to see about the film before I walk into a theater. While I&#x27;m still a little iffy on some aspects, I was already in for a viewing when I heard Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser for the first time. Anything else, all the fun jokes and references, that&#x27;s just bonus.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie hits theaters in the U.S. on April 5, 2023.

                              <span>Bit of a wait
Apogee has announced that Wreckit Games’ open-world adventure Elements has succeeded in its Kickstarter campaign and is set to drop into Steam Early Access in the second quarter of 2024, followed by a release on various consoles in 2025.
Elements is a vibrant-looking open-world game set in the land of Elemythia. The game gives some mad Breath of the Wild smells, but it looks to differentiate itself by providing some home-building mechanics and two-player co-op. The developer is also touting a “Hollywood screenwriter” and the voice actress who lent her cords to Princess Zelda in Breath of the Wild.

I’m a bit of a fan of Apogee’s reinvention of itself. Utilizing its name recognition for publishing small and independent titles feels a bit like a return to the company’s original manifesto. I doubt we’ll be getting a rebirth of shareware, however.
With that said, while Elements definitely has a charming look to it, I think I’m hitting my tolerance limit for open-world games. It’s a genre that grows and grows as the years go on but still somehow stays exactly the same.
Nevertheless, the people have spoken, and the Kickstarter campaign sits at around $200,000 Canadian Loonies as of writing. The campaign runs until Friday, March 3, 2023, at 6:00 PM PST, so there’s still a bit of time to nab a tier if this all looks interesting.
If not, Elements will hit Steam Early Access in Q2 2024. The full title is expected to come to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in Q2 2025.

                              <span>Devils and angel wings
Bandai Namco dropped a new trailer for Tekken 8 this morning, spotlighting another key character in the universe, Jin Kazama. The latest Tekken 8 teaser is all about the longtime series lead and his moves, both new and old.
As Jin says in his new character trailer, &quot;strength isn&#x27;t everything.&quot; But he is looking pretty dang strong in the Tekken 8 engine. It looks like Jin is incorporating his devil powers within his usual fighting style for some devastating hits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vkJQZ2Cz9-s
It&#x27;s an interesting look for Jin that looks even better in the Tekken 8 arena. Tekken has usually impressed with its graphics, and that&#x27;s held true for everything we&#x27;ve seen so far of the next entry in the series. Everything from the electric punches and slow-motion zoom-ins to Jin&#x27;s best &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; pose looks fantastic already.
Fist meets fate
Bandai has been drip-feeding out more and more characters from Tekken 8, though we&#x27;ve mostly seen the usual suspects. Trailers have spotlighted other mainstays like Kazuya Mishima and Nina Williams.
Still, even the familiar can be exciting when it looks as solid as Tekken 8 does. It&#x27;s hard to get a gameplay gauge just from video, but it&#x27;s looking like the next year or so could be a big one for fighting games. Street Fighter 6 is on the horizon, Project L is in development, and apparently Mortal Kombat 12 is happening too.
Tekken 8 still doesn&#x27;t have a firm launch locked in, but it could be quite a time for fans of virtual scrappin&#x27; as all these new combatants enter the ring.

                              <span>If you’ve paid any attention at all to Final Fantasy XVI, you likely already know how action-forward this game is. It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. 
With such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. 
His answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. 
Suzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. 
“Clive.” 
There you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.</span>

                              <span>After previewing Final Fantasy XVI for roughly two hours, which you can read about here, I’m left most interested in the different styles of combat happening throughout the game. Clive has his own style of Devil May Cry-esque combat, party members controlled by A.I. up the ante, Clive’s dog Torgal can attack enemies, Clive can fight Eikons, and there are even Eikon vs. Eikon fights. It’s a lot for one game to juggle, and after my relatively short preview, I feel that the team is confident in this balancing act. 
But I wanted to learn more, so I asked FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki how the team manages so many unique combat experiences.

As you can see, Final Fantasy XVI is looking to be the most action-heavy mainline game in the series.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward mainline Final Fantasy game in the series yet, and that’s in no small part due to the person behind its action: combat director Ryota Suzuki. After nearly 20 years at Capcom working on combat for games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5, Suzuki decided he was ready for something new. 
That &quot;something new&quot; turned out to be FFXVI. The game’s director, Hiroshi Takai, and its producer, Naoki Yoshida, offered Suzuki a role at Creative Business Unit III, leading FFXVI’s combat design. And now, on June 22, players will be able to feel what I felt during a recent hands-on preview of the game: it’s very Devil May Cry meets Final Fantasy, in the best way.

                              <span>The Final Fantasy series’ numbered entries haven’t been turn-based RPGs for quite some time. With each new game, the series moves further away from its classic turn-based roots toward a more action-oriented combat system. Combat has never been further from being turn-based in a Final Fantasy game more so than in Final Fantasy XVI, which is the most action-based game in the mainline franchise yet. I recently played about two hours of the game to dive deeper into the combat system’s mechanics, and you can read my preview thoughts on that here. 
But after playing some of the game, I spoke with the FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, director Hiroshi Takai, and combat director Ryota Suzuki about this continued shift to deep action and whether Final Fantasy will ever return to its turn-based roots. A…</span>

But during this preview, I was also able to participate in a group interview of FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, the game’s director Hiroshi Takai, and its combat director Ryota Suzuki. 
One facet of FFXVI’s development I was especially interested in is how Creative Business Unit III, the internal studio behind the upcoming game, is able to balance creating this new title while continuing to develop its extremely successful MMO, Final Fantasy XIV. Yoshida, who is FFXIV’s producer and director, says it’s not as different as you might think.

Why is the movie being moved up? It&#x27;s unclear, but we&#x27;re not complaining. The new date applies to over 60 global markets, though the Japanese premiere is set for April 28. For those wondering, April 5 lands on a Wednesday.

According to Takai, it all started with summons. 

“So when the project started, I was one of the first people that [Yoshida] came to first and he said, ‘Okay, we have this project called Final Fantasy XVI.

You won’t find difficulty settings like easy, medium, and hard. Instead, there’s a story-focused mode and an action-focused mode. The story-focused mode will be easier, while the action-focused mode appears to be the default difficulty setting. And within each of these modes, there are special accessories that can be equipped to tailor the difficulty of combat to your liking.

                              <span>I recently went hands-on with Final Fantasy XVI, the next mainline entry in the long-running series due out on PlayStation 5 this summer, to play roughly two hours of the game. Most of that playtime consisted of me controlling Clive as I battled alongside ally Cidolfus Telamon (always a Cid, right?) through a castle dungeon. However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. 
At this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon. Clive, however, is not a Domin…</span>

                              <span>Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game&#x27;s developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. 
It&#x27;s a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won&#x27;t be seeing its name appear on future titles.
&quot;The merger is part of the Company&#x27;s efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group&#x27;s development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group&#x27;s ability to develop HD games.&quot; 
As you can see, it&#x27;s not that Luminous Productions&#x27; developers are no longer with Square Enix; it&#x27;s just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it&#x27;s the result of Forspoken&#x27;s mixed reception at release, but that&#x27;s speculation.

Since the reveal of Final Fantasy XVI in 2020, my questions about the title have continued to grow. Mind you, my questions are firmly planted in the fascination of everything surrounding this game, like how Final Fantasy XIV studio Creative Business Unit III is developing the title with Naoki Yoshida in the producer role or how former Devil May Cry 5 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 combat designer Ryota Suzuki is the game’s lead combat director. Will FFXVI feature the storytelling prowess of FFXIV? Will its combat go full stylish action? What does it mean that this upcoming sequel is the first Mature-rated game in the series (qu…</span>

                              <span>Just a few days after the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring&#x27;s release, developer From Software has revealed that an expansion for the game is currently in development. 
Revealed by the official Elden Ring Twitter account, this expansion is called Shadow of the Erdtree. Not much is known about the expansion, but those familiar with the game&#x27;s lore (especially those that have completed the game) might be able to piece together what this new adventure will consist of. Alongside the news, From Software has released what appears to be a piece of concept art for the expansion. 
Check it out for yourself in the tweet below:

This is exciting news for fans of Elden Ring, but given that From Software has only revealed the expansion is in development, with no release date or window in sight, it might be a while before our return to the Lands Between. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave the game a 10.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.
Today, Alana nominates Star Fox Guard, a curious entry in the Star Fox series that&#x27;s still worth a look today.

The narrative, which is told through stop-motion animation from Dwarf Studios, stars Haru. a concierge a the Pokémon Resort, and Psyduck. The stories that unfold center around her interactions with the various Pokémon that pass through the resort. 
&quot;Netflix is looking forward to delighting fans in Japan and around the world with Pokémon Concierge, an entirely new visual and storytelling experience featuring groundbreaking stop-motion animation set in the Pokémon world in close collaboration with The Pokémon Company,&quot; vice president of Netflix content in Asia Minyoung Kim said in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;re also excited to reveal this new series on Pokémon Day and provide fans with even more things to look forward to on this special holiday celebrating the popular franchise.&quot;
Ever since spring 2020, Netflix has been the exclusive home to the Pokémon anime in the United States. While those seasons have continued the story of Ash Ketchum and Pikachu, Pokémon Concierge represents a completely new focus within the world of Pokémon.
We don&#x27;t know much more about this new series, but we did receive a teaser trailer, which you can see below.</span>

                              <span>After last year&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet quickly became some of the top-selling Switch titles, it was just a matter of time before Game Freak and The Pokémon Company announced downloadable content for the Paldean adventures. During today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents livestream, we got our first glimpse of the new stories and journeys that await in Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s DLC.
The overarching tale, which unfolds over the course of two parts, is called &quot;The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.&quot; The first part, titled &quot;The Teal Mask,&quot; begins with a school trip to the land of Kitakami, which features a big mountain with people living at the base. The Pokémon Company describes Kitakami as a &quot;place of tranquil expanses featuring rice paddles and apple orchards.&quot; While there, the students can experience a festiv…</span>

                              <span>Fedora Linux zvažuje konec DeltaRPM. DeltaRPM umožňují snížit množství stahovaných dat při aktualizacích tím, že se stahuje pouze rozdíl mezi starou a novou verzí balíčku. Už řadu let se ale jejich přínos zpochybňuje. Přenosové rychlosti se natolik zvýšily, že množství přenesených dat už není takový problém. DeltaRPM naopak zpomalují instalaci aktualizací tím, že se po stažení musí nové verze balíčků sestavovat ze starých verzí a stažených rozdílů. U průměrně rychlého připojení k internetu tak aktualizace ve výsledku zabere více času.</span>

                              <span>With the new Ryzen 7000X3D processors arriving today, it&#x27;s perhaps not surprising to see last-gen models reaching new price lows. That&#x27;s the case for the Ryzen 5700X, one of the fastest eight-core Ryzen CPUs ever made (behind the 7700X, 5800X and 5800X3D) and now firmly a member of the sub-£200 club. In fact, this processor is down to £177 at Amazon UK at present, meaning it&#x27;s rapidly approaching half of its £329 UK RRP. 
Yes, I know the CPU pictured is the 5800X. Please don&#x27;t tell anyone! I didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d look at it that closely.

                              <span>Buying American imports on Amazon UK is one of the best ways to get a steep discount without resorting to lesser-known sellers, and occasionally you find a deal that is streets ahead of the nearest comparable price in Blighty. That&#x27;s the case with this deal, where you can pick up Lexar&#x27;s NS100 SATA SSD in a beautiful 1TB capacity for just £46. 
That&#x27;s a super low price for what is by all accounts quite a reasonable drive, with read speeds up to 550MB/s, write speeds up to 500MB/s, TLC NAND flash memory and a DRAM-less design.

Honestly, I am more cat food than man at this point.

                              <span>Oh no, poor Kerbal Space Program 2. The extremely anticipated sequel to everyone’s favourite rocket-building space exploration game is a hot mess. A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.
The developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.

                              <span>Most JRPG fans on PC probably know Hironobu Sakaguchi as the creator and grandaddy of the Final Fantasy series. After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&amp;A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.

After ten months of radio silence, the devs have finally released another trailer and launched a second Steam page - thankfully, the game still seems just as cool.

It’s also an unexpected remaster, redoing and fine-tuning everything from companion AI and facial animations to weather effects and dynamic lighting. It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.

                              <span>Late last year game voted Most Likely To Make Me Accidentally Say The Name Of A Different Game and neo-old-school space RPG The Outer Worlds was rated for a mysterious Spacer&#x27;s Choice Edition. Obsidian are now ready to officially reveal said wash and brush up, which is coming next week on March 7th, and bundles both DLCs for the game with remaster-y improvements to AI, VFX and technical art. To mark the occasion I got to chat with co-directors Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, and producer Eric DeMilt, all of whom who made games that are stastistically likely to number among your favourites - especially if you like RPGs.

                              <span>I spent some time with Crime Boss: Rockay City, the upcoming Payday-esque heist FPS that sees you tackle crime and murder in either singleplayer or co-op, all with nostalgia hits from characters played by Michael Madsen and Vanilla Ice. What&#x27;s happened here is: I&#x27;ve come away with thoughts, but they&#x27;re thoughts on one of three modes that&#x27;s the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren&#x27;t playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I&#x27;m unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.

Echoes Within is undeniably the biggest update to Infinite since launch, as it’s adding new maps, weapons and equipment, and expanding the multiplayer’s narrative - which has been a series of perpetual teases so far.

In exchange for a relatively small settlement and a promise not to infringe again, BREIN took no further action. After being caught for a second time, the financial consequences are much more serious.

The company removed 92 repositories from GitHub, claiming that they infringed the company&#x27;s copyrights and trademarks. A repository of DIY decompiling tools and instructions remains online, however.

Instead, Mangamura&#x27;s demise led to an explosion of sites and even more piracy. Publishers face significant challenges but with the entertainment industries and government now on board, Japan&#x27;s systematic fight against piracy applies to all content, everywhere.

Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
Episode 3 - Terror Dactyl 
Episode 4 - Gas That Raptor
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>Nintendo has confirmed that it will not participate in E3 this year. This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. 
In a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. 
&quot;We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.&quot;
Although Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn&#x27;t returned. 
E3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3&#x27;s success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles.

In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.

Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. 
So who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?
February 23, 2023
Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. 
Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours). A story expansion called Aftermath arrived in 2020.</span>

                              <span>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land originally released on the Nintendo Wii in 2011 and is remembered fondly as a Kirby that relied less on gimmicks and felt like a fun throwback to the pink vacuum&#x27;s original adventures. Join Kyle Hilliard and Brian Shea for a look at the Switch remaster of the game, which adds new content and abilities. You can also find Brian Shea&#x27;s full review of the game right here.

                              <span>Most RPGs set you off on some kind of grand quest, a hero&#x27;s journey filled with danger and peril as you track down some legendary sword to defeat a world-ending evil. Boots Quest DX, however, has much humbler aspirations. You are a mere boot enthusiast on an adventure to find the very bestest best boots known to man (or blobs, I genuinely can&#x27;t tell what provenance these rotund creatures hail from), and nothing else will deter you from achieving your lifelong goal. Find a honking great sword on the beach? Trash. A pirate&#x27;s cutlass? Get in the sea, literally. If it&#x27;s not a pair of boots, you&#x27;re not interested - and it all makes for a brisk, anti-RPG adventure that&#x27;s incredibly refreshing.

                              <span>Jank. I am saying &quot;jank&quot; several times upfront, not because Spacebourne 2 is particularly janky, but because it is a bit, and I want to temper your expectations so you&#x27;re not unfair on its flaws if you try it after I bang on for the rest of this article about how impressive it is.
There&#x27;s a dream space game we all imagined, where you pilot a ship freely around the galaxy, landing on planets and space stations and running around them doing stuff, finding things, maybe having a fight, then get back into your ship to launch into space, where you can stop at any time and do a little space walk. Maybe walk around on an asteroid, just because.
Spacebourne 2 isn&#x27;t the dream. But for a game made, as far as I can tell, by one person, it is an astonishing effort to capture that spirit.

                              <span>To no one’s surprise, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is an always online game, even when playing alone without friendos. The news comes from an official FAQ page that reads, “Yes, an internet connection is required to play Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League solo or via online co-op.” It’s disappointing news, especially for those hoping to play Suicide Squad as a single-player experience with AI bots filling in for squadmates.

                              <span>“At some point,&quot; says Joel Jordan, &quot;Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”


Allow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. 


So, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].

The coming-of-age high school drama was originally set for a 2021 release, but a narrative reboot let it slip into 2022, which then turned into 2023 - which is now.

Hawk&#x27;s famous Thunderfoot tribe. Before we talk about anything else, though, can we please just take a moment to appreciate Zangief&#x27;s enormous bod? The Street Fighter wrestler was always a force to be reckoned with in earlier games, but holy heck, I bet you could fit four Marcus Fenixes into those biceps and still have room left over for his son and fellow Gears Of War slab JD. Come and see what I mean in the new trailer below.

Oh, by the way, there&#x27;s a reason why all these spaceships are now empty. Well, mostly empty.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s only February, but my God do I feel like I need a holiday. Somewhere nice and warm away from the UK&#x27;s gross rain and seemingly never-ending winter. Looks like I won&#x27;t have to wait that long, because Awaceb&#x27;s Tchia looks exactly like the kind of break I need, and it&#x27;s out March 21st. We got the news, and a new trailer, at last night&#x27;s State Of Play showcase,

                              <span>The difference between game and film reveals has always been funny to me. Game announcements are accompanied by million-dollar trailers, teased with reveals of reveals, and some fans tiptoe online to avoid the spoilers of a debut trailer. Meanwhile, films are often first revealed haphazardly through an excel sheet five years before they hit, or mentioned casually in an earnings call - which is exactly how Warner Bros. Discovery announced the existence of Mortal Kombat 12.

                              <span>According to a report by Bloomberg, Activision may have switched up their plans so this year&#x27;s Call Of Duty release will pivot from being a paid expansion to another new Modern Warfare game developed by Sledgehammer Games. It&#x27;s said to continue Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s story and carry over bits and pieces from its multiplayer, too.

                              <span>I was excited to play The Settlers: New Allies. Not so much because it&#x27;s the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.
The answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I&#x27;m not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.

Roundhouse kick a clergy of priests? Shoot grenades at the Spanish Amish? Capcom’s newest trailer reveals all and it looks like Leon Kennedy’s dance moves are still intact.

                              <span>I am extremely sympathetic to professionals complaining about celebritites horning in on their turf, but I will make an exception in the case of J.K. Simmons voicing video game villains. Portal&#x27;s Cave Johnson remains one of the greatest turns in video game voice acting history, and we can now look forwards to Simmons playing a well evil, invincible necromancer in Larian Studios&#x27; RPG Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - which, incidentally, is releasing into 1.0 form on August 31st. Fair play to &#x27;em: they said August, and August it is. A new trailer featuring Simmons&#x27; character Kehteric Thorm, and the release date, was showcased at Sony&#x27;s State Of Play event last night.

It turns out it&#x27;s a game with lots of floaty air combat, lots of noise, lots of loot and gear scores and weapon classes, and with a battle pass (but for cosmetics only). Plus there will be DLC to add new characters post-launch.

                              <span>The next game from the developers of Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite is called Humanity, and it&#x27;s an action-puzzle game in which you control a Shiba Inu and try to guide crowds of people around obstacle-strewn greybox levels. A bit like Lemmings, maybe, but presumably with a surprising emotional resonance. Watch the trailer below.

And cor, I&#x27;ve never seen such love for individual expansions and total conversion mods among mainline RTS games and 4Xs. As with all strategy games, however, there can only be one victor - and you can find out what that single strategy game to rule them all is right here.

                              <span>There’s a touch of poetry to the way Wild Hearts carves so liberally from Monster Hunter. After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. 


Besides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.

                              <span>You know it’s a great turn in The Pale Beyond when only five of your crew are freezing, two have frostbite, and one has scurvy. After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.
It’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.

                              <span>This week on The Electronic Wireless Show podcast our interest was piqued by new trailers for a Jesus simulator and a politics in hell strategy game. We ask ourselves: why are there so many hell-themed games and so few heavenly ones? Is it blasphemy? What would our pitch for a game set in heaven be? (Spoilers for that last one: there&#x27;s a lot of admin involved). We also chat about what we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and Nate orchestrates a mini-game pitchathon that goes at least somewhat off the rails.

                              <span>My backlog is practically overflowing at this point, hence my New Year&#x27;s resolution to avoid buying a game until I’d actually play it. But, every now and then, an especially deep discount will catch my eye, my bad impulses wake up, and I spend a few quid on something I won’t touch for six months (seriously, Abzu has been floating on my hard drive for years.) My New Year&#x27;s resolution won’t hold out for much longer, as Valve have announced their schedule for all of 2023’s Steam Fests and sales events.

                              <span>Warhammer 40k: Darktide seemed like a recipe for certain success when it launched late last year. Developers Fatshark were taking the formula established in their co-op horde shooters Vermintide, throwing in some beefy melee, and moving it over to the 40k universe. Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update.

Amazon Prime members can snag seven free games throughout March, with 90s RPG Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Enhanced Edition leading the pack, followed by the cute puzzler (and undercover horror game) I Am Fish. New games are available every Thursday, so scribble that day into your calendars.

Less great is that it still runs like concrete on PC, even after a performance-focused patch that developers Omega Force had detailed even before the game had formally released.

That&#x27;s the best laptop I&#x27;ve seen at this price as of late, and while this laptop is designed more for work than play, its integrated RX Vega graphics are still capable of playing older titles. 
The MagicBook 16 initially debuted at £849.99 (and still costs that much on Amazon UK), and has since dropped to £549.99. To get today&#x27;s £499.99 price, use code AGOBEYOND50 at the checkout.

Original story: Tango GameWork’s co-founder and studio head Shinji Mikami is reportedly leaving the Evil Within company “in the coming months.” This comes courtesy of TrueAchievements who saw and verified a company-wide email sent to employees by Bethesda’s VP of development Todd Vaughn. &quot;I am writing today to let you know that studio head Shinji Mikami has decided to leave Tango Gameworks in the coming months,&quot; Vaughn said. &quot;Mikami-san has been a creative leader and supportive mentor to young developers at Tango for 12 years through his work.”

                              <span>A Russian security company is reporting a surge in movie and TV show-related domain registrations. Some believe that pirates are buying domains to exploit an upcoming gap in the market when Hollywood licenses expire at the end of the month. Telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor claims that Ukraine and its allies are running pirate sites for propaganda purposes.

                              <span>Today’s PlayStation State of Play concluded with an in-depth look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League by Rocksteady Games. Set five years after Batman: Arkham Knight, the adventure centers on the villains turned government-mandated saviors trying to stop a global invasion by Brainiac, who has hijacked the minds of Earth’s greatest heroes.
Metropolis serves as the game’s open-world sandbox, and the adventure can be enjoyed alone or with up to three other friends in co-op (requiring an internet connection for both and supports cross-play). The video presentation highlights each Squad member’s traits. Harley Quinn is the most acrobatic, sporting a grappling hook to swing across buildings. Deadshot uses a jetpack to fly or hover while using various assault weapons to riddle foes with bul…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Sony State of Play included a new trailer for Street Fighter 6, which served to introduce three characters joining the roster – the last ones we should expect to join the launch game line-up.
The arrival of Zangief, the professional wrestler, comes as little surprise, since he’s been a part of the line-up for so long. He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.
Likewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.
Lily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.
Street Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s that time of year again: today was Sony&#x27;s first State of Play of 2023. While it showcased many indie games and an extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the presentation started with a look at five new games coming to the recently released PlayStation VR2 headset. If you missed the live stream, here&#x27;s a refresher.
  



      
												
Foglands
Described on the PlayStation Blog as a &quot;western sci-fi roguelike,&quot; Foglands was the first game shown at the livestream today. Developed by an indie studio called Well Told, the game has you fighting monsters, grabbing loot, and trying to escape from danger before you&#x27;re swallowed by the Fog. Foglands releases later this year.

                              <span>Sony showed a new trailer for Resident Evil 4 at the most recent State of Play live stream, and it&#x27;s great. Now, the trailer is below the next paragraph, and I know you want to skip right into watching it. Which you should. However, let me give you the quick hits.
Luis is present in way more of the game now – he&#x27;s shown with Leon in the minecart section (also we see the minecart section) – we get a brief look at the Krauser fight, more detailed views of combat, the late section of the game that goes full Call of Duty (which is and has always been good), some brief glimpses of Ashley&#x27;s sections, and a tease for Mercenaries. Okay, the trailer is below. There&#x27;s a lot more I didn&#x27;t type out because you aren&#x27;t reading this, and I do not blame you. Have fun, friends. The game looks great.

                              <span>Accompanied by a somber cover of Radiohead’s “Karma Police,” Bungie rolled out a new look at Lightfall during today’s Sony State of Play presentation, and shared the expansion&#x27;s launch trailer.
In this latest trailer, we get several new glimpses of the narrative that lies ahead in the expansion. If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.
It’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.
We won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.</span>

The game comes from the creators of Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite and centers on controlling a dog to herd thousands of people across bizarre platforming challenges. The trailer also revealed tools to create your own levels and share them with other players. 


Humanity launches this May for PlayStation consoles, PlayStation VR and VR2, and PC via Steam. The demo is available now until March 6.</span>

                              <span>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 launched recently with only a handful of proper exclusives. Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.
Resident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal. The recent VR remake of Resident Evil…</span>

                              <span>Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.
Bethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn&#x27;t cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: 
Mikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.
It&#x27;s unclear what Mikami will do next, but he&#x27;s leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango&#x27;s portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here&#x27;s our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we&#x27;re excited to see what&#x27;s next for the veteran designer.</span>

                              <span>This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).
The intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.
Participants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.
ScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.
We have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.
We are looking forward to your application and participation!

                              <span>The European Union warns that pirate sites can lead users to malware and other unwanted content. Unfortunately, the EU also has its own piracy problem; its official website continues to be exploited by bad actors to advertise piracy-related scams. Meanwhile, male enhancement gummies, Onlyfans hacks, gift card generators, and other scams are promoted too.

                              <span>A condition of watching streaming service Pluto TV is that users must use approved methods such as official apps. This is the reason that Pluto TV is free, since revenue is generated through advertising. Unofficial Pluto TV .m3u playlists are easy to access and do away with advertising and user behavior tracking mechanisms. A copyright complaint sent by the MPA this week pulls no punches; these playlists facilitate piracy on a massive scale.

                              <span>Another day, another drop on AMD graphics cards. This time is special though, as it&#x27;s one of the best value points on the current Team Red GPU hierarchy, the RX 6700 XT, and it&#x27;s also a top-rated Asus Dual design. It was previously retailing for around £400, but now it&#x27;s dropped at Amazon to £372.54, a very reasonable price for this level of performance.

                              <span>AOC make some of the best value gaming monitors in the business, especially in the mid-range where you can get some truly impressive specs and solid build quality at surprisingly low prices. Case in point is this deal on a 27-in 1440p 165Hz gaming monitor for just £230 after a solid £135 reduction. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for this spec, which looks great and offers a competitive advantage over 60Hz alternatives.

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I talked about a number of new features coming to RPS in 2023, and here we are with our very first edition of Ask RPS! This is a new mailbag feature where RPS supporters get to pose questions to the RPS Treehouse team (mostly video games-related, though not necessarily always), and we then answer those questions in public posts for everyone to get involved with. Easy peasy.
To kick us off, our first question comes courtesy of Old_Man_Gaming, who asked: &quot;What was the first game that really grabbed you and dominated your life?&quot; 
Come and find out which games had us trapped in the throes of childhood mania below, and why not tell us about your own gaming obsessions in the comments? You might just find a surprise kindred spirit.

Developers Hello Games have updated the game so consistently their launch woes are a distant memory, sent to a faraway galaxy. Since then, No Man’s Sky has become a not just a space exploration game, but a city management sim and a generally nice place to chill with your odd alien pets, all in one package.

                              <span>Even after a decade marked by the abandonware crowd being proven right, there are old games that remain lost between the cracks of digital distribution. Instead of waxing lyrical about that though, I&#x27;m here today with good news: My favourite open world 3D spaceflight/trading sim Hardwar is back.
It&#x27;s been back for over a year, in fact, via Zoom Platform, who&#x27;ve just made the interesting choice to publish it on Steam too, promising that their own store will remain resolutely DRM-free, and that this aims &quot;to help fund additional signings and improvements for our DRM-Free preservation efforts&quot;. I&#x27;ll brush aside analysing this strategy, because the immediate upshot is that, hopefully, Hardwar might finally get its due. In a better world, we&#x27;d already be playing its modern descendants.

Its most recent twist came in the complete lack of ray tracing at launch, despite various pre-release builds having been held up by Nvidia themselves as the technology’s exemplars. Crispy critters, indeed.

I asked Team Lazerbeam&#x27;s Ben Rausch about how it tackles themes of queer identity and diversity in a kickass way, which I highlighted in my post, but wanted to highlight even more here. Their answers were too good not to share.

                              <span>Amazon Games have announced that they’re bringing NCSOFT’s South Korean MMORPG Throne And Liberty to the Americas, Europe, and Japan. NCSOFT has a history of publishing their own games worldwide, as they have done with Guild Wars in the past, so their agreement with Amazon is somewhat unique. Amazon haven’t given a release window for Throne And Liberty, but they’ll be publishing the game on PC and consoles with cross-play enabled.

                              <span>Documentaries chronicling game development are great. With so much marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

Backpack Hero has been successful for its three-person dev team and stood apart from other roguelikes with its Tetris-inspired inventory management. You see, success in Backpack Hero is determined by how you organise your bag rather than what you’re actually carrying, as you shuffle items around a grid to create synergies and mod your playstyle.

Story packs are mid-sized expansions that flesh out Stellaris’s universe and this time First Contact is focusing on pre-FTL civilisations, taking a step back from the stars. The expansion was officially revealed back in January after a series of SteamDB leaks outed the project.

Their new one is called The Last Starship, a layered spaceship simulator that&#x27;s less friendly than their prison. I am not sure if it&#x27;s because the early access is still largely without any tutorial markers, or because I am very bad at the game.

I thought of it again while watching the trailer for Lumencraft, which seems to marry all of the above to a fully destructible world and lots more resource gathering. It&#x27;ll leave early access on February 28th.

Dead Space is a great case study, as Motive Studios smartly updated Visceral Games’ successful template while preserving its most beloved elements (here’s our review). To learn more about how the remake came together, we had a conversation with Motive Studios’ Roman Campos-Oriola, the creative director of the Dead Space remake, to reflect on the game’s development and success. However, there’s an added twist. 
Joining the discussion is Bret Robbins, creative director of the original Dead Space. The ex-Visceral designer has beaten the remake multiple times and shares the standout elements of Motive’s version. Additionally, he reveals the limitations Visceral faced while developing the original that …</span>

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launches today, and the new VR version of Resident Evil Village alongside it. However, fans have wondered about the status of the previously announced PS VR2 port of the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake that was briefly teased last year. Capcom has finally broken its silence with a small update.
In a press release, Capcom states that development has officially begun on Resident Evil 4’s VR mode. Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one. We&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. 
Resident Evil 4 launches on March 24 and is Game Informer’s cover story this month. Be sure to visit our coverage hub to find a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos dissecting the anticipated remake.</span>

                              <span>Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.
Each sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge&#x27;s fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor.

Following a long run of gimmick-heavy titles, 2011&#x27;s Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land signaled the franchise&#x27;s return to the traditional platforming style. With four-player co-op, a massive suite of fun copy abilities, and cleverly designed stages, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land stands out as one …</span>

                              <span>Wild Hearts is apparently a pretty good lower-case monster hunter game, albeit one with some substantial performance issues its developers pledged to fix. Maybe now they have: a performance patch was released earlier today, promising to address frame rates, unintentionally capped high-end CPUs, and more.

This is an awesome price for one of the fastest SSDs on the market, with the advent of the even faster (but significantly more expensive) 990 Pro pushing the previous flagship to nearly bargain basement territory.

The film production company is launching Blumhouse Games, a division that will fund, publish, and produce horror games primarily by indie devs. The company say they’re looking for “original” content, so don’t expect any M3GAN spin-offs for a while.

                              <span>Time is flying by a little too fast in 2023, although it’s not all bad news as a new month means new Game Pass additions. Microsoft have announced the next four games hitting the service before March 3rd, alongside Atomic Heart which releases today. I was interested in the steely Soviet shooter until I read James’ review and saw that the protagonist yells “Crispy critters,” more than once - I think I’ll skip.


Here are the next batch of Game Pass titles:

Merge &amp; Blade (Feb 28th)
Soul Hackers 2 (Feb 28th)
F1 22 (March 2nd)
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (March 3rd)

This is my first time hearing of Merge &amp; Blade, not to be confused with Mount &amp; Blade which is also on Game Pass. Merge &amp; Blade is a hybrid between puzzle games and auto-battlers. Rounds will start with a Tetris-like mini-game, but instead of shapes, you’re guiding different unit types and merging them together. You then use your completed party to raid castles and kill monsters. Mixing - or merging - Tetris into a new genre is a recipe for success, so I’ll definitely be downloading this one.

Sons Of The Forest was originally going to launch into a full 1.0 release this month, but the team ultimately decided on an early access release since it worked so well for the game’s predecessor The Forest.

                              <span>I see the question, &quot;What order should I play the Yakuza games in?&quot; pop up on the reg. Like clockwork, it happens whenever a new Yakuza (or Like A Dragon, as it&#x27;s now known) game arrives. And you know what? It gets to me. To experience the series in the richest way possible, there&#x27;s an obvious answer. But if you&#x27;re someone who hasn&#x27;t got the time to do so, or you&#x27;re a bit unsure whether Yakuza is for you, then there&#x27;s another way in. Now pick up that bike and walk with me.

Lots of heavy hitters have big sales like Return Of The Obra Dinn and Pentiment, but as always, you’ll need to do quite a bit of scrolling to find the hidden gems. The sales last until February 27th, so you have a week to grab some cheap games, and if you’re struggling with recommendations, here are some good’uns.

Terra Nil has released a few demos over the last year, taking Steam by storm and impressing players with its ecological twist on the genre. All those demogoers should be pleased to hear that Terra Nil is finally launching onto PC and mobile (through Netflix) on March 28th.

There are very few exclusives only playable with PlayStation VR2, but many developers have ports available on day one. This is fantastic for new VR players, and perhaps a little disappointing to veterans. Whether you’re diving into VR for the first time or you’ve played plenty on competing headsets, here is a list of games, presented in alphabetical order, I enjoyed for the first time, or all over again in PlayStation VR2.

The Theatrhythm series has been a standout, if criminally underplayed, example of how to both showcase a series’ excellent set of scores while celebrating a prolific franchise’s history. Since the previous entry’s release on 3DS in 2014, Final Fantasy music has evolved thanks to the releases of Final Fantasy XV, Final Fantasy XIV expansions, remakes, and more. Theatrhythm Final Bar Line folds these additions into a mix of returning classics and lesser-known tunes to create an amazing catalog of songs to play through in the series’ trademark take on th…</span>

The event begins at 1 p.m. Pacific/4 p.m. Eastern on Twitch and YouTube and will reveal five new PSVR2 titles. Beyond that, it doesn’t seem like we should expect anything first-party related. The announcement tweet states that third-party titles and indies will get a bulk of the spotlight. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which launches in May, will also have an in-depth segment with extended footage.

The event comes during a big week for Sony, as PlayStation VR2 launches on Wednesday, February 22 (check out our review of the headset here). We last saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at the Game Awards last December, where it was confirmed to launch on May 26 and will feature Kevin Conroy&#x27;s final video game performance as Batman.

After more than half a decade in development, Atomic Heart has arrived as the first title from developer Mundfish. This BioShock-inspired shooter is an impressive debut in many ways, and it wears its influences on its sleeve – for better and worse. The game’s dazzling world design, extraordinary production values, and fast-paced fights make for a solid campaign, but the derivative plot and often painful writing insist on dragging it down.
Atomic Heart’s premise is one of its most intriguing elements. The game t…</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Presents returns Monday, February 27, with 20 minutes of Pokémon news celebrating Pokémon Day 2023. 
The official Pokémon Twitter account announced this today, with a short 15-second video hyping up the presentation. There&#x27;s not too much to glean from the video, but it does feature the main theme from Pokémon Red and Blue. Since the reveal earlier this month that Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games are playable on Switch via Nintendo Switch Online, fans have speculated that older Pokémon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and even Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald could appear on the service one day. Perhaps that&#x27;s an announcement we&#x27;ll be getting this Sunday. 
The next #PokemonPresents is on the way, Trainers! 🤩
#PokemonDay 2023! 🎉

With the presentation lasting 20 minutes, there&#x27;s plenty of time for an announcement like that and more. And in recent years, the Pokémon Day direct-style presentation has been quite stellar. Last year during the Pokémon Day stream, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were announced alongside a big Pokémon Legends: Arceus update, a Pokémon Brillaint Diamond and Shining Pearl mystery gift (Shaymin), the Alola update for Pokémon GO, and other announcements for games like Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and Pokémon Cafe Remix. The Pokémon Company event announced a new online anime, too. 
Only time will tell if this year&#x27;s Presents features as many exciting announcements. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because Pokémon Day is Monday, February 27. The Pokémon Presents begins at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and will run about 20 minutes. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review and then read our review of Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

                              <span>Brazil&#x27;s Ministry of Justice says that an operation to protect Japanese anime content has shut down two of the largest anime piracy sites in the country. The names of the sites appear to be a secret, so inevitably that makes them much more interesting. What we found may be bigger than naming two sites. More sites are also offline - big ones too.

                              <span>After the mud and forests of Normandy, and the grim, snowy climes of the Eastern Front, Company Of Heroes 3 feels like World War II on its summer holiday. With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic&#x27;s breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It&#x27;s a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over.

The end result is an award for $3.6 million in damages and over $700k in fees and other costs.

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!
