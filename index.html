I&#x27;ll not pretend it&#x27;s warm yet in Scotland (evidence: not seen a single lad going taps aff) but we&#x27;ve had a few nice days and you can feel hope, you can feel hope in the air, it&#x27;s coming. Winter has been too long. So, uh, enjoy hunkering down inside playing Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2? Tell me, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>In Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, saves are handled pretty differently than in most games, and you&#x27;ll have to delete the file to start a new game. There&#x27;s not really much actual manual saving, and for now, there&#x27;s no way to delete your saved data from the main menu. It&#x27;s a problem across PC (via Steam), and PS5. 


Basically, there are two saves: the last time you slept at an Inn and the most recent time you left the game. If you choose to save manually, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 acts more like an autosave than an actual, reloadable save point. The intent is for choices and decisions and their weight to matter, and Capcom clearly tried to prevent save scumming. Still, there may be situations when you want to delete that data. Here&#x27;s how to delete saves in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, including how to remove your Steam Clo…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s nothing like a pleasant, romantic stroll with that special someone—unless a horde of goblins decides to rudely interrupt it. Regardless, the romance options in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 bring a sense of peace to this dangerous world, at least for a moment. However, the abundance of choices in the game can make it somewhat challenging to comprehend how the dating world works. 


How does Romance work in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2?


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s Romance takes shape when providing gifts or completing certain quests. However, not all Affinities produce romance options. It could also be tied to individual preferences they may have, ultimately staying within a friendly basis.  


Since the concept of love isn&#x27;t explicitly clear in the game, our interruption of romance in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 involves a …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re like me, the term Salon in Diviner&#x27;s Salon in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 might have you thinking it&#x27;s a place to get a haircut. However, that&#x27;s not the case. The Diviner&#x27;s Salon in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 serves a very important purpose and can actually help you progress through the game if you get stuck.

What is the Diviner&#x27;s Salon?


The Diviner&#x27;s Salon in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is essentially a fortune teller that can tell you what you need to do to progress the state of your game further. If you visit the Diviner&#x27;s Salon you can pay a small fee of 50G to get your fortune.


Your fortune is actually very useful, as it will tell you where you need to go next in order to progress your current main quest in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. For example, if you need to find something in the Slums in Vernworth in order to progress your main quest, the Diviner&#x27;s Salon fortune will say something about visiting the Slums.


Overall it&#x27;s a great way to know how to proceed if you get stuck at any point in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 which is very easy to do. In such a massively open-world game it&#x27;s easy to not know where you need to proceed, at which point you should visit the Diviner&#x27;s Salon. Especially because 50G is barely any amount of money at all in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.

Where is the Diviner&#x27;s Salon?


You can find the Diviner&#x27;s Salon in between the Merchant Quarter, the Noble Quarter, and the Slums in the main city of Vernworth. If you look at the screenshot above it will show you exactly where you can go to find the Diviner&#x27;s Salon. It appears this is the only Diviner&#x27;s Salon location in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, as I have not found one in all of Battahl.


The Diviner&#x27;s Salon location seems static as well, as Ursula is available to give the player guidance all hours of the day, morning or night. I highly recommend visiting her anytime you get stuck as at 50G it&#x27;s a really easy way to know where to go next!

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>

How to toggle lantern on and off in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2


During the game&#x27;s early stages, you&#x27;ll earn a lantern to guide you through the darkness. Hold down the interaction to &#x27;Switch Weapon Skill&#x27; and then select &#x27;Lantern On.&#x27; Then, hit the same buttons again to turn it off. For all consoles, use these inputs:



PS5 - L1 + right on D-Pad


PC - CTRL + R


Xbox Series X|S - LB + right on D-Pad



With the Weapon Skills open, various options are presented, including Lantern On, Items Menu, and healing items.

The latest frustrating obstacle, Minecraft Exit Code 1, seems baffling at first, but there are steps you can take to try and fix it.


Minecraft &#x27;exit code: -1&#x27; seemingly appears when there&#x27;s some kind of incompatibility issue following an update. For some, it means the new version of Minecraft isn&#x27;t playing well with older mods you have installed. However, the word about town suggests other things can cause the error. Naturally, that means we have several trains of thought when it comes to a fix.

Keep in mind that each shrine requires a special Liyue Shrine of Depths Key to open, which is obtained through various quests and domain challenges. Do the World Quests and domains in Liyue, complete the Ascension challenge at Adventure Rank 35, and you should have all ten Keys.

What the hourglass icon means


A quest with the hourglass icon beside it means you need to pass some time in order to progress the quest. This is a very common occurrence in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, but thankfully it is easy to pass the time in the game. Of course, time naturally progresses as there&#x27;s a full night and day system.

Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 Ulrika Romance guide


To romance Ulrika in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, complete the following quests:



In Dragon&#x27;s Wake


Readvent of Calamity


Home Is Where the Hearth Is



The first mission won&#x27;t be hard to miss, as it is part of the game&#x27;s main storyline. Despite the dragon&#x27;s flames, the fire between you and Ulrika is even hotter, leading you to her character-specific quest, Readvent of Calamity. It requires finding her in an unknown location that&#x27;s a long trek away from Melve. But don&#x27;t worry; the invisible string that binds you together will guide you, or in this case, a Pawn with a Quest Guide activated.

After locating Ulrika, check on everyone at Melve again with Home Is Where the Hearth Is. This mission is likely the one you&#x27;ve been looking for since it ends with a delightfully romantic moment. I won&#x27;t spoil too much with this quest, but the key is to make sure you talk with her at Harve Village during the night. She&#x27;ll be stationed at the docks there and will ask you out on a date; at least, I&#x27;d like to think it is. 


When the steamy moment is over, Ulrika may appear at a player&#x27;s house in Vernworth. It isn&#x27;t as romantic as the night in Harve Village, yet it is still nice to spend time alone with her. Aside from the missions, gifts can also be exchanged, and her preferences are Adorable and Beautiful items. Return to Harve Village to locate her and try to raise her Affinity level for even more surprises.

                              <span>In the most recent version of the Call of Duty battle royale mode, Warzone, players can earn a nuke. Just like in multiplayer, which requires 30 kills without dying, a nuke ends the match and results in an instant win. However, 30 kills without dying in Warzone is too tall an order, so there are other ways to get a nuke in MW3 Warzone. 


How to unlock a Warzone nuclear bomb Champion&#x27;s Quest


The Champion&#x27;s Quest in Warzone is the mission you unlock when a nuke is available. In the previous iteration of Call of Duty, it was more commonly known as &#x27;the nuke contract&#x27;. Additionally, the previous method of earning a shot at the Champion&#x27;s Quest is still available, but another (easier) method is possible too.


Unlock the Champion&#x27;s Quest by doing one of the following:

Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has some performance issues


First off, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is using Capcom&#x27;s RE Engine, and definitely pushes it to its limits. For comparison, the RE Engine has also been used to develop Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village, the Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 remakes, as well as Monster Hunter Rise and Street Fighter 6.


While the engine is certainly capable, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 features …</span>

                              <span>Stratagems are powerful tools in Helldivers 2, but you&#x27;re limited to four each mission. But if you&#x27;re fortunate, you may be able to up that count. The SEAF Artillery found on a map adds an extra Stratagem to the mix, but it works best when you choose the right payload.


There are multiple payload variants. The best payload options you can use for the SEAF Artillery can be based on preference, but it also depends on the difficulty and enemy type in Helldivers 2. If you&#x27;re against bugs, tossing down a napalm strike to defend points is ideal. But when fighting Automatons, a calculated EMF strike is wiser. For high-level missions, you can pick smoke to cover your retreat. Both factions die to explosives, though, and those are likely the ones you want to know about the most.

Ancient Seeds grow into, as you can probably predict, Ancient Fruits. These Ancient Fruits can net you a tidy profit on their own, but you’re much better off turning the Fruit into Wine using a Keg and then aging it by putting it in a Cask. 


Before you can get an Ancient Seed that will actually grow into anything, you’ll need to get your hands on an Ancient Seed Artifact. I know this sounds like a lot, but don’t worry, I can walk you through everything.

                              <span>Oh, good question. Pawns in Dragon’s Dogma 2 have their own inventory, and since inventory space is at a premium due to weight, it is sometimes necessary to load up your underlings. But if they die or you dismiss them with a full inventory, what happens to that stuff?


I wasn’t quite sure myself, so I did some testing. I had a pawn who was underleveled and it was time to replace them. Before I went to dismiss them I gave them some things. I gave them a wizard’s cap and 11 Pityword.


I then took the Pawn back to the Rift Stone and dismissed them. I checked my inventory, and the items were not there. So, I went to the hotel next door and looked in the storage. Both the 11 Pitywort and the wizard’s cap were there, added to the stack for the former item and just in equipment for the latter.


So, that answers that. If a Pawn is dismissed, their gathered items go into storage.


When they die, it’s the same thing. Any item that they were carrying goes into your storage.


However, whatever items they came through the Rift with will go away with them. You can’t summon a Pawn, steal all their gear, and send them back. That’s not possible.


One question that still remains, however, is if a stack in your storage is already at maximum (99), what happens to it? For me, I had over 99 goblin horns, so I gave a Pawn two of them and dismissed them. I checked my inventory, and they hadn’t returned. I then checked my storage, and they weren’t there either. I was also not financially reimbursed for them. The horns were simply gone.


So, there’s your answer. If a Pawn is dismissed or dies, the items they collected are sent to your storage. However, if they’re returning an item that already is at the maximum amount in your storage, the items disappear. The way I figure it: if you’ve already got 99 of something in your storage, you probably won’t care if a few go missing. But that’s just me.

But to earn them, you need to level up your renown with the pirate captain. And that means getting wins. We&#x27;ve got a look at the best skills to hunt down to make sure you come out on top.


How do I find skills?

Before we tell you what skills to look for, you should know how to look for and upgrade them. Skills have a chance to drop off of any enemy or player, as well as chests. They show up as big icons on the ground that you can collect. There are two types of skills: Attack Skills and Utility Skills. You&#x27;re able to carry up to two of each, and a usable item in the fifth sl…</span>

Getting Rift Crystals fast


You get Rift Crystals from a variety of sources in Dragon’s Dogma 2. They can even be found in chests and dropped by enemies, though this is the slowest and rarest way to get them.


Another way is by activating Rift Stones throughout the world. You should probably just be doing this anyway, but it gives you a small amount of RC by doing so. Personally, I think this is just a bonus on top of the Rift Stone activation. It’s a slow and limited way to gather RC.


The best and quickest way to get Rift Crystals is…</span>

                              <span>With the release of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, many have made comparisons regarding gameplay and visuals across its compatible devices. More specifically, some wonder about the game&#x27;s PS5 performance and FPS rate, and we&#x27;re here to show you what to expect. 


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 resolution and frame rate, explained


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s resolution stands at 3840 x 2160, and it cannot be tweaked due to the limited console graphic settings. However, despite restrictions on this version, the PS5 image quality is pretty sharp and detailed, especially regarding lightning and environmental textures. Maybe there are some blurry visuals here and there when entering big cities or character-filled fights. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s not too much of a concern based on my own experience.

                              <span>It happens to the best of us. Maybe you’re selling off your unneeded inventory in Dragon’s Dogma 2, and you’re going through as quickly as possible and don’t realize your cursor has moved over a required item, and suddenly it’s gone. Thankfully, there is a way to get it back.


For obvious reasons, I haven’t tried to sell every quest item I come across, but from my experience, Dragon’s Dogma 2 doesn’t do anything to stop you from selling something important. There’s no message to warn you that you’re about to do a dumb. Moreover, quest items have price tags. Some of them are significant. In fact, it can be worthwhile to sell them when you don’t need them anymore.


Anyway, you probably know all that. You’re here because you need to get something back. All sold quest items are found at Ibrahim’s Scrap Shop in Checkpoint Rest Town in the far West of Vermund.

To get your items back, just talk to Ibrahim and you’ll get a list of options. Select View special finds and you’ll be taken to a normal shop window. Everything related to a quest that has been sold will be available to buy back, though the prices are higher than what you sold them for.


There are times when a quest item won’t show up here, and that’s when the item isn’t unique. In Vocation Frustration, for example, you need to get a greatsword and an archstaff to unlock the Warrior and Sorcerer vocations. If you sell one of these instead of returning it to the shopkeep, it won’t go back to Ibrahim’s Scrap Store. That’s because any greatsword will do, and they’re sold in the shop at Checkpoint Rest Town. This goes likewise for the soldier and noble disguise sets.


Mostly, be careful what you sell. I sold a book that I later needed, and it was hell to try and find again because it wasn’t a unique quest item. However, if you do sell something truly unique, you can get it back at Ibrahim’s Scrap Store.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has sparked a lot of controversy over the addition of a ton of microtransactions and paid DLC with its launch. While none of the microtransactions are necessarily pay-to-win by any means, some of them are pretty useful which is understandably frustrating for a $70 game. Here are all the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 microtransactions currently available, both the free and paid DLC.

All paid Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 DLC


.Here are all the paid Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 microtransactions currently available for purchase:



500 Rift Crystals (A) - $0.99


500 Rift Crystals (B) - $0.99


500 Rift Crystals (C) - $0.99


1500 Rift Crystals (A) - $2.99


1500 Rift Crystals (B) - $2.99


1500 Rift Crystals (C) - $2.99


1500 Rift Crystals (D) - $2.99


2500 Rift Crystals - $4.99


1 Wakestone (A) - $0.99


1 Wakestone (B) - $0.99


1 Wakestone (C) - $0.99


1 Wakestone (D) - $0.99


1 Wakestone (E) - $0.99


1 Portcrystal - $2.99


1 Art of Metamorphosis (Character Editor) - $1.99


1 Makeshift Gaol Key - $0.99


1 Ambivalent Rift Incense (Change Pawn Inclination) - $1.99


3 Harpysnare Smoke Beacons (Lure Harpy) - $0.99


1 Heartfelt Pendant - $1.99


1 Explorer&#x27;s Camping Kit - $2.99


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma Music &amp; Sound Collection - $2.99



As you can see, some of these microtransactions are pretty nifty. Portcrystals and Wakestones are hard to come by, so being able to buy some feels a bit against the nature of the game. The same can be said for Rift Crystals. While you&#x27;ll earn a little bit in-game by renting out your Pawn, being able to purchase a bulk amount would let you hire higher level Pawns much sooner than you probably would otherwise.


All free Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 DLC


There is just one free Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2DLC at the moment which is the Character Creator and Storage. This tool let&#x27;s you create your Arisen and Pawn and then port it into the actual game.

You can choose pawns of your desired vocation to build out a party and fill certain roles that you and your pawn do not cover. There is no untenable way to build your party, make no mistake. However, there are, at least, safer ways to do so.

                              <span>Pawns are a very weird central mechanic in Dragon’s Dogma 2. Not only are they your party members, but other players pick them up to join on their adventures. It’s an exchange very unique to the series.


As such, when you make your Pawn, you not only want to fill a role in your overall party, but you also want to make them attractive to other characters. I mean that both in a literal, physical sense, but also vocation and specialization. 


If you&#x27;re making your main Pawn initially and are wondering what you should choose, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I&#x27;d recommend something of a different vocation from what you&#x27;re playing. Regardless, you can easily change your Pawn&#x27;s vocation later to suit your needs. They level up their vocation in the same way that you do.


However, if you want to make your Pawn desirable for other players, there are ways.

Best main pawn vocation


If you’re looking for a main pawn that both supports you and brings home the bacon (Rift Crystals), then that’s also difficult to answer.


The best suggestion I have is that, if your playstyle requires a specific kind of pawn at all times, then other players will need it, as well. Everyone has a different playstyle, and everyone is going to prefer different pawns. A mage, warrior, or fighter might be the most sought after, but I don’t think it will make a major difference. If you look at the standings for most popular pawns, there’s a vast assortment of vocations.


In my opinion, specialization and appearance of pawns are what matters most. For example, I try to always have a Woodland Wordsmith in my party in case we run into elves. Even if you don’t have access to a certain specialization, having one set makes your pawn more likely to stand out, as is having a weird or (weirdly enough) attractive pawn.


But again, everyone has different preferences, but hopefully I’ve given you some idea on how to best suit as many as possible.

                              <span>The first Major Orders in Helldivers 2 were simple planetary liberation missions, but as they&#x27;ve grown more complex, players must use supply lines if they want to achieve success. 


For the most part, Helldivers 2 is pretty straightforward. If enough players throw themselves at a planet or objective, then they&#x27;ll usually complete it. Especially if that objective falls on a weekend. However, developer Arrowhead Game Studios has evolved its Major Orders just like the Terminids have evolved wings, and now players must use supply lines if they want to have any hope of completing a Major Order again.

Furniture Catalogues are classed as decorative items that, when placed down on your farm, give you unrestricted access to a long list of themed items. Each Catalogue has its own theme and it’s usually obvious what that theme is from the name of the Catalogue itself.


One of these Catalogues, the Trash Catalogue, is filled with the kind of thing that would make any self-respecting Raccoon (and his lovely family) happy - Trash. The items included include a Moldy Couch, a Broken Television, and even the Plastic Lawn Chair that you recog…</span>

                              <span>Whether you’re trying to work your way through Mr Raccoon’s long list of requests, or you simply just fancy yourself some Dried Fruit to help you keep going long enough to see sundown, you’re going to need a Dehydrator. Here’s how to get one in Stardew Valley. 


The good news is that you don’t need to get to a particular point in the game as the recipe is available from the very beginning, though you will need to save up a bit if you’ve just started a new save file in honor of the 1.6 update. If you&#x27;re getting a Dehydrator purely to please Mr Raccoon, you&#x27;ll also need a Smoker.


How to get a Dehydrator in Stardew Valley

There are two routes you can go down if you want to get a Dehydrator - you can buy the recipe, or you can effectively steal one once you reach a certain early landmark point of the game. 


The huge benefit of buying the recipe (aside from being free of the guilt that comes with obtaining one through theft) is that you can make as many Dehydrators as you like. It can be a bit of a pain to only have one of anything, so if you’re wanting a lot of Dried Fruit, this is the way to go. 


To purchase the Dehydrator recipe, you can visit Pierre’s store at any point in the game and cough up 10,000 Gold. It’s right at the bottom of his list of wares, underneath the Saplings and to make a Dehydrator, you’ll need the following resources:



30 Wood


2 Clay


1 Fire Quartz



However, once you’ve earned 25,000 Gold and Demetrius comes to visit you asking to use your cave so that he can observe the local species, you do have a chance to get your hands on a single Dehydrator for free. Don’t judge me, I found this out by accident with a misclick.


If you opt for a Mushroom Cave, you’ll get a Dehydrator inside. Of course you can use it within the cave without any issue, but if you use your Pickaxe on it, the Dehydrator will go into your inventory and then you’re free to place it wherever you like.

It wasn’t until I saw the world through my daughter’s eyes that I sat down and took in the stories of these fantastical characters who are just strange enough to pull you in, but stay grounded enough to engross you.


Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley follows the titular character as he returns to Moominvalley after wandering over the winter. The valley, a peaceful haven for nature and the Moomins’ sustainable lifestyle has changed, though. Nature has been organized and contained, and Snufkin’s best friend, Moomintroll, is nowhere to be found.

How to find your Pawn ID in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2


Screenshot by Destructoid


Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to finding your Pawn ID in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.



Open your in-game Pause menu.


Select Status


Scroll through to your Pawn using C/Z on PC, RT/LT on Xbox, or L2/R2 on PlayStation.


Select Pawn using Q/E on PC, LB/RB on Xbox, or L1/R1 on PlayStation.


Look for the Pawn ID section in Arisen Details.



Once you reach this menu, you&#x27;ll find your Pawn ID, username or Gamertag, and other information about your Pawn. You&#x27;ll also spot your Pawn Quest, badges, vocation, and other helpful information to help you gauge your Pawn&#x27;s progression. You&#x27;ll be able to find the ID and username of your Pawn and other players, but not those officially created by Capcom.


How to use your Pawn ID in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2

To use someone&#x27;s Pawn ID to invite their character to your party, head to any nearby Riftstone and select Search for a Pawn. From here, you&#x27;ll find the following options:



Advanced Pawn Search


View Favorite Pawns


Friends&#x27; Pawns


View Previously Hired Pawns


Pawns Your Main Pawn Knows


Search by Pawn ID



By selecting Search by Pawn ID, you can type someone&#x27;s Pawn ID and invite their character, allowing you to use them during your playthrough. Likewise, you can check your friends&#x27; Pawn list and summon those your friends have made, allowing you to skip the Pawn ID process entirely.

Ingredients for Fruit Roborant in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 and where to find them

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 departs from the norm of standard games when it comes to save files. 


You&#x27;ll see that clearly from the main menu screen, which is missing a key feature that any player would be familiar with. We&#x27;re talking about starting a new game in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, a simple yet complicated aspect of this new Capcom entry. 


How do you start a new game in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2?


You must manually delete your saves to start a new game in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. I know it&#x27;s a bit unusual, but it was done this way to make your choices more impactful. For example, once the character creation is done, race cannot be adjusted afterward. This also includes the decisions made throughout the game, from siding with one character during a quest to winding up in jail. 


To delete your Steam cloud saves for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, you&#x27;ll need to locate the correct files. The console version isn&#x27;t as tricky, as it only requires going to the settings and manually getting rid of them there. For a full breakdown, check out our guide on deleting saves. 


Although changes are limited in the game, a few exceptions exist, primarily with character creation and Vocations. Those who aren&#x27;t entirely satisfied with their avatar may salvage their design through the barber. Of course, it won&#x27;t showcase all the features of the initial character creator, but it still beats starting a new save for it. Vocations are completely changeable at any time, too, via the Vocation Guild. 


If you want to start a new game in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 because of a &quot;wrong&quot; decision, you may have some luck with the &#x27;Load from Last Inn Rest.&#x27; It will return the party to the last inn, potentially wiping out this mistaken choice. I recommend sleeping here before embarking on some big mission. Sometimes, it&#x27;s easy to tell when a decision-making event is about to happen, especially when two characters are at odds. So, before progressing further in these quests, rest at an inn, just in case.

There have been plenty of Ghostbusters games across all platforms in the years since Egon, Ray, Winston, and Peter first busted onto screens in 1984, and they run the gamut from classic licensed cash-in to carefully constructed homage.

In the last seven years, the bounty of software that has come to Switch is really remarkable. You might argue that, in fact, there&#x27;s too much great stuff being released — too much to be able to play everything you&#x27;d like, at least.
Let&#x27;s get things straight — we ain&#x27;t complaining! But given the games that have come to Switch, you look at the ones that are MIA and it makes you wonder why.

                              <span>According to a site construction notice.
Back in 2021, Nintendo announced that it was building a museum-style facility, then called the “Nintendo Gallery”, on the site of its Uji Ogura Plant in Kyoto, with expectations that construction would be finished in March 2024. The building work on the site — since given the official title Nintendo Museum — looked to be on course from the outside, but it seems the museum will miss its target completion date by a month or so.
The construction notice displayed at the site, as captured below by @hanayohaneNEKO on Twitter (thanks, Kyotogamer), now lists the completion date as 30th April. It&#x27;s unclear how long this notice update has been up, but it does appear that the museum won&#x27;t quite be ready for the end of March.

If you can believe it (and, to be honest, we can&#x27;t) it has been a whopping 15 years since Pokémon Platinum first arrived on Western shores. It has been a decade and a half since we first met Giratina and co. A decade and a half since we stepped foot in the Distortion World. And, most importantly perhaps, a decade and a half since we last got an &#x27;ultimate&#x27; third entry to a Pokémon generation.
We&#x27;ll dowse ourselves in Repel Spray before taking a step further — yes, you could count Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon as a &#x27;definitive&#x27; edition for Gen VII. In fact, we might even do the same. This is a pair of games that carried much of the same DNA as the ones that came before them (Sun and Moon, in this case) while adding new Pokémon, locations, and a fresh storyline. Sounds pretty &#x27;ultimate&#x27; to us.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Velan Studios, the team behind Knockout City, has announced it is entering a reorganization that will likely result in layoffs. 
In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio&#x27;s co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

                              <span>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of the year’s most anticipated games, and by most accounts, the experience lives up to the hype. The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.
In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

                              <span>Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game&#x27;s expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game&#x27;s story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. 



Are you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game&#x27;s writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

Jelikož se jedná o open-source software, vznikl fork suyu (výslovnost: sue-you, překlad: zažalovat tě).

I&#x27;ve been having a swell time with this over the last few days, particularly as I noodle about in the other big backdrops that weren&#x27;t available in its earlier demo.  
But there&#x27;s been another Summerhouse development this week that has arguably delighted me even more. Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword &amp; Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they&#x27;ve seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let&#x27;s make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah?

                              <span>Readers may be aware that I am a Warhammer 40K orbiter, but I am not of Warhammer 40K. Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.

                              <span>I’ve got about one more Amazon Spring Deal Days highlight left in me today, so I’m going to spend it on something that’s close to my heart. And, currently, my left foot. It’s the lovely NZXT H5 Flow, an airy mid-tower case that’s easy to build in, smart-looking, and 21% off in both black and white.

                              <span>Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it&#x27;s also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year&#x27;s Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.

                              <span>Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn&#x27;t really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.
Passing By - A Tailwind Journey isn&#x27;t aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It&#x27;s the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you&#x27;re meant to go when they get around to it. It&#x27;s not a purely vibe-based game, but you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.

                              <span>Last time I checked, my pawn Bronco sat at 80 in the monthly leaderboard of the pawn global rankings. Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn&#x27;t quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn&#x27;t being picked up by adventurers as much as I&#x27;d like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I&#x27;m not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

                              <span>One of the neat things about massive Amazon sales, especially if you’re not keen on filling their coffers specifically, is that rival retailers often counter with big deals of their own. The best one I’ve seen during the current Amazon Spring sale is this Ebuyer offer on the excellent Crucial T500 SSD: the spacious 2TB model isn’t just cut down from £163 to £140, but it comes with a free Gamesplanet code for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 arrives on PC and consoles today, but despite high critical acclaim when reviews hit earlier this week, players on Steam have begun review-bombing Capcom&#x27;s high fantasy RPG after the appearance of some sudden and confusing microtransactions. These weren&#x27;t present in the press build of the game, and players are so up in arms about them that the game is currently sitting on a fat red &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; Steam rating based on over 11,000 reviews and counting.

The action-RPG&#x27;s developers announced last night that the closed beta planned to start on the 7th of June will now not. They think they could have something ready by then but it wouldn&#x27;t be up to their standards, so what&#x27;s the hurry?

                              <span>While nearly all of the best Amazon Spring sale deals are available to all, some Prime-exclusive offers are popping up every now and then. Take this Ugreen Docking Station, a longtime member of our best Steam Deck accessories guide: Prime members can have one for 30% in the UK and 40% in the US. Gated as they are, these savings make Ugreen’s dock less than half the price of Valve’s official Steam Deck Docking Station, despite it providing a similarly healthy supply of ports and jacks.

                              <span>Last night, IGN posted a news piece about how Undawn, a free-to-play survival game starring Will Smith as some kind of apocalypse pal called Trey, has been a massive flop. Released in June 2023 for mobile and PC, Undawn had an allegedly huge budget, according to Reuters sources, but which only brought in under $300K last month, as estimated by research firm Appamgic. And on hearing this news everyone went: &quot;Sorry, what are you talking about?&quot;

Nor will they be making any DLC or expansions for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, for that matter - a stance I 100% respect as the studio starts to think about what&#x27;s next for them.

Last night they announced Knights In Tight Spaces, where you&#x27;ll build decks with cards for turn-based tactical manoeuvres and magic-tinged action so you can bash baddies on small grids.

                              <span>Last month, developers Jyamma announced Enotria: The Last Song, an Italian-inspired Soulslike where masks give you powers. It was originally due out on June 21st, but then FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree would also launch on the same day. Not ideal. So, Jyamma delayed Enotria&#x27;s release, and in an announcement at last night&#x27;s Future Games Show, we now know it&#x27;s launching in August. It has, however, dropped itself into another conundrum: Black Myth: Wukong, another hotly anticipated Soulslike, arrives a day earlier.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is, as a game per se, very good! It’s creative and intelligent and lets you fill other players’ worlds with recruitable humanoid versions of your pet cats. Still, a technical masterclass it is not. In my performance analysis, I touched on DD2 being particularly unplayable on the Steam Deck, suffering from sub-10fps framerates and a bunch of broken settings. Since that was based on pre-release code, I had quietly hoped that Capcom could pull something – anything – out of the bag to salvage handheld PC play in time for launch day, but now the time has come, I’ve checked again, and nope. This RPG adventure simply doesn’t work on the Steam Deck, and probably never will.

The beautiful open-world adventure game Tchia — which launched on PC and PlayStation in 2023 — is landing on Switch this Summer. The announcement was made during today&#x27;s Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024.
Tchia&#x27;s bright and colourful world is inspired by New Caledonia and sees you on a quest to save your kidnapped father. Tchia, the main character, can &quot;soul jump&quot;, which means she can possess animals and items around her. As a human, she&#x27;ll need her trusty leaf glider, raft, and ukelele to travel around and inspire.

                              <span>Not so Horrid Henry.
Set in the 15th century and taking place in the tumultuous land of Bohemia, Kingdom Come Deliverance follows the exploits of nice-but-dim blacksmith’s son Henry. Struggling through the political and religious machinations of the lords and ladies around him, he seeks to avenge the death of his family and find a place in the world. But first, he needs to learn how to use a sword…
One of the very first tasks in Warhorse Studios&#x27; epic RPG is to collect a debt from a lowly drunkard. After a short intro to dialogue choices, you proceed to confidently throw hands with the peasant. After being roundly beaten within an inch of your life, you limp off to mother to get fixed up. It’s an appropriate intro to this gritty journey of bloody revenge. There are many ways to approach a confrontation, it’s going to be a while before violence is the easy option.

Step aside Mario, because Princess Peach is here to show everybody what she&#x27;s capable of. Yes, after a reasonably short wait, Princess Peach: Showtime! is about to launch on Nintendo Switch, but the big question is whether it&#x27;s actually any good.
The good news is that, yes, it does seem to maintain the usual Nintendo magic that you&#x27;d expect, and it received a more-than-respectable score of 8/10 from ourselves. We said that &quot;there&#x27;s creativity, style, and fun to spare here, with levels packed full of secrets, cool outfits, and enough new mechanics to ensure nothing ever outstays its welcome&quot;. Sounds decent! Check out our full thoughts for more details:

Fae Farm, the charming life sim from developer Phoenix Labs, isn&#x27;t quite done with updates just yet. The latest, aptly titled the &#x27;Spring Update&#x27;, brings a number of improvements and additions to the game that should prove most welcoming for fans.
The biggest change is honestly something that we wish was a thing in real life, and that&#x27;s the &#x27;double-day length&#x27; feature. In a nutshell, it essentially slows down time to allow you to perform more tasks within a single day. Given how much there is to do in the game now, this sounds like a dream come true.

The latest Japanese charts are in courtesy of Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu) and it&#x27;s another victory for Atlus&#x27; Unicorn Overlord, which comes in at number one again after selling a further 16,012 copies. Not bad considering how difficult it&#x27;s been to picked up a physical edition recently.
It&#x27;s another resounding success for the Switch as a whole, actually, with the only representation for the PS5 being Final Fantasy VII Rebirth at number two. Elsewhere, we&#x27;ve got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe at number three, Super Mario Bros. Wonder at number four, and Splatoon 3 even pokes its head in at number ten.

                              <span>Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">
                          <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2023/08/11/36603f58/baldurs_gate_3_art_crop.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. &quot;We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that&#x27;s made to create DLCs or expansions,&quot; Vincke said. &quot;We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It&#x27;s not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it&#x27;s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.&quot;


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There&#x27;s no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there&#x27;s a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze&#x27;s in-development D&amp;D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft&#x27;s D&amp;D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since Balatro, the poker-inspired deckbuilding roguelite, was released, and it has taken the gaming world by storm. In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn&#x27;t share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…</span>

                              <span>Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we&#x27;re still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.</span>

                              <span>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of &quot;the greatest of all time&quot; inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we&#x27;re taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we&#x27;ll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you&#x27;ll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…</span>

In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at &#x27;mostly negative&#x27; status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to The Movies. It&#x27;s launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

                              <span>In November last year, the Australian post-apocalyptic CRPG Broken Roads was abruptly delayed mere days before it was meant to come out. Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed &quot;additional polish time and QA manpower&quot; to test the &quot;thousands of permutations&quot; available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

                              <span>Welcome to the final part of Electric Nightmares, a short series about generative AI and games. So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI&#x27;s growing dominance.

                              <span>No James this week, but I am joined by Nate for this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast to discuss Ubisoft&#x27;s new NEO NPC prototype - an NPC you can have a stilted, weird conversation with using the power of AI! It&#x27;s fair to say we are quite partisan about this and do not want it, but we discuss why anyway. In counterpoint, we think World Of Warcraft&#x27;s new piratey battle royale game mode sounds pretty cool and good, actually?
Plus: I ask Nate to explain cool things that I&#x27;ve seen in Warhammer 40K: Darktide, and Nate tries to convince me to take a devil&#x27;s bargain where I have to play WOW for at least 12 hours a day, but I get a sort of increasing MDMA high while doing so.

                              <span>Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I&#x27;ve been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold&#x27;s assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than &#x27;feed the fish&#x27; and &#x27;talk to so and so&#x27;, all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it&#x27;s Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He&#x27;s a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he&#x27;s some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn&#x27;t help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone&#x27;s underlying frustration with him like it&#x27;s all water off a duck&#x27;s back. It doesn&#x27;t seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he&#x27;s too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant. After all, it&#x27;s not just Harold that&#x27;s being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn&#x27;t just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it&#x27;s also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.

                              <span>I usually know right away when I&#x27;m going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don&#x27;t always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it&#x27;s the sense that you&#x27;re making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you&#x27;ve been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn&#x27;t the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don&#x27;t figure it out in time, you&#x27;ll have to make a new character and try again. And if you&#x27;re an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you&#x27;ll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even do it without getting stabbed.

                              <span>Before a month of my life vanished into customising cards and rigging decks in Balatro, my desire to conquer dungeons by fixing gambling tools came from playing Slice &amp; Dice. First released in 2020, it&#x27;s a gauntlet of fantasy turn-based battles where most attacks, abilities, buffs, debuffs, and items are very cleverly handled by mapping them onto the faces of dice. Oh, you&#x27;re going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice &amp; Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while, but I&#x27;m finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I&#x27;m currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&amp;B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who&#x27;s a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It&#x27;s also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It&#x27;s a mixed bag, is what I&#x27;m saying.

                              <span>I’m not saying it’s some kind of electronic commerce conspiracy orchestrated by Big Graphics Card, but I’ve noticed that most of the best Amazon Spring sale deals on gaming monitors are for 4K screens. On the one hand, aww, because everyone likes a bargain 1440p-er. On the other, woo, because gaming-spec 4K monitors are usually some of the most financially devastating PC hardware pieces you can get. Anything that makes these super-sharp displays more affordable is, therefore, quite welcome. 160Hz, UHD visuals for £399? Sure, why not.

Riot co-founder Marc Merrill announced that the project has been &quot;reset&quot; and won&#x27;t appear for &quot;likely several years&quot;, with one of the main reasons being a &quot;need to do something that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre&quot;.

Powerful. May 9th is the day, so you have time to practise your touchtyping with Mavis Beacon. I really enjoyed playing Cryptmaster&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo, so I&#x27;m excited for the full game.

Meanwhile, Cloudflare will draw attention to overblocking by urging customers affected by the blunder to file official complaints.

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.


“It’s not a sequel – it is just in the world of Hyper Light. It will have common threads, themes, and shared components,” director Alx Preston says. “If you played Drifter you will see reappearin…</span>

                              <span>Hyper Light Breaker is not a sequel to Hyper Light Drifter in the traditional sense, but it does take place in the same world, which is all we needed to hear to be excited. While this isn&#x27;t gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

                              <span>Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other&#x27;s methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance&#x27;s story consultant, Marc Bernardin.</span>

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Bungie’s reboot of their nineties pre-Halo debut shooter Marathon seems to be slowing down its pace a little in order to get across the finish line, with a change in director and a delay meaning the multiplayer-only loot-shooter reimagining of the FPS is now expected to arrive next year - or potentially even after that, according to recent reports.

                              <span>We’ve known that a Marvel game from former Uncharted writer-director Amy Hennig has been in the works for years, learning in 2022 that it will focus on Captain America and Black Panther during World War 2. Thanks to a proper reveal during today’s State of Unreal event, we now know that it’ll be called Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra and we’ll be able to play it sometime in 2025.

                              <span>This article&#x27;s headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

Only its high price remains an ongoing concern, though the Amazon Spring Deal Days sale (that’s the Amazon Big Spring Sale to US folk) can at least take some of the sting out of upgrading. There are, while they last, cut-price RTX 4060 Ti models up for grabs on both sides of the pond.

                              <span>One of the most controversial and often-cited criticisms of modern AI systems is that they’re built from, and dependent on, the stolen work of other people. It’s far from the only criticism people have of this new technology, which might make us wonder exactly why anyone wants it in the first place. Today, I’d like to talk about some of the brighter futures that might come out of generative AI for us, as well as why the path toward them might be a tricky one to walk cleanly.

But it reinforced one thing for me that I&#x27;ve increasingly come to realise about myself: I actually can&#x27;t cope with character creators that let you like, tweak the finest details. I do not want to define the curls of each individual nose hair or adjust the angle of the mole on one&#x27;s forehead. I&#x27;m far too indecisive for any of this! Let me roll the dice, please.

So it is with the Intel Core i5-12400F: this was a great-value midranger when it was new, and now you get it at a true budget-tier price of £108.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

                              <span>You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2&#x27;s closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn&#x27;t only grander, it&#x27;s still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it&#x27;s great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian&#x27;s fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I&#x27;m always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn&#x27;t reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

                              <span>There could well be more to come, but right now, my top pick of the Amazon Spring Deal Days PC storage offers is this nicely affordable Crucial P3 SSD. It’s the 2TB model, sliced down to £86, which is the cheapest this particular drive has been since last year’s Black Friday. Not to mention about the same price as a 1TB WD Black SN850X, while providing twice as much room.

Otherwise, there&#x27;s changes to unlocking premium skins, earning premium coins, and some tidbits on what we can expect from Season 11.

                              <span>It&#x27;s GDC week, and conversations are being had about AI. Ubisoft have blundered into this, in classic Ubi style, by revealing that they&#x27;ve had an R&amp;D team beavering away on a project called NEO NPC. It&#x27;s the usual pitch. &quot;Have you ever dreamed of having a real conversation with an NPC in a video game?&quot;, asks Ubi&#x27;s official post about it. And what all people who make this fail to understand that the answer most normal people give if they think about it is &quot;Erm, probably no, actually?&quot;
Still, the internet made good hay from the prototype image Ubisoft shared on Xitter, as many people took the opportunity to make fun of the dialogue from Bloom, a prototype man in a prototype beanie who wants to be your friend.

                              <span>Dnes podvečer vychádza najnovšia verzia Javy, Java 22. Zrejme najzaujímavejšou novinkou je nové API pre prácu s funkciami mimo JVM. API zastrešuje JEP 454 pod názvom JEP 454: Foreign Function &amp; Memory API. Toto nové programovacie rozhranie nahrádza zastarané JNI (Java Native Interface). Využíva ho napríklad projekt jnetpcap-wrapper, ktorý je nadstavbou nad C-čkovou knižnicou libpcap.</span>

                              <span>Generative AI is all over the entertainment industries right now, and lots of people in games are making excited noises about finding new ways to integrate it into their products, from game developers and publishers such as Ubisoft and Square Enix to platform holders and hardware firms such as Epic and Nvidia. This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?

                              <span>Just when I thought I was past being surprised by games adding battle royale modes, Blizzard today announced one for World Of Warcraft. Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It&#x27;s initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

As the name implies, it&#x27;s a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload&#x27;s founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they&#x27;re viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. &quot;The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward,&quot; Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. &quot;We&#x27;re not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining.&quot; Rather, it&#x27;s &quot;more of a reimagining&quot; of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have any particular expectations for Heart Machine&#x27;s open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016&#x27;s alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio&#x27;s last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed&#x27;s review, &quot;has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels&quot;. Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

                              <span>Microsoft have confirmed the waves of games coming to Game Pass in late March and early April, headlined by the expected addition of Diablo IV. This is the first Activision Blizzard game coming to Game Pass since Microsoft&#x27;s ridiculous $69 billion acquisition, with more due to follow. Beyond that, look forward to games including mech-riding farming game Lightyear Frontier and the colossal alien invasion strategy game from the XCOM Long War team, Terra Invicta.

                              <span>Cyan Worlds today announced plans to launch their fancy real-time 3D remake of Riven later this year, coming with support for both VR cybergoggles and standard meatspace screens. Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker&#x27;s mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D&#x27;ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

                              <span>Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

There&#x27;s a demo out right now that lets you explore a portion of the sandy map, try out a handful of the characters, and ride some rusty vehicles ahead of its release next month on April 25th.

                              <span>In the run-up to Total War: Pharaoh at the end of last year, a slightly strange question popped into my head: &quot;What if someone made a Total War game that also had the handsome anime looks of Fire Emblem: Three Houses?&quot; Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that&#x27;s not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn&#x27;t just an anime Total War-like. It&#x27;s also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard&#x27;s big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a &quot;massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,&quot; so if you&#x27;ve been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they&#x27;ll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here&#x27;s the rest of the line-up:

                              <span>Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&amp;D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&amp;D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&amp;D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&amp;D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&amp;D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

                              <span>The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It&#x27;s so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it&#x27;s unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.</span>

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it&#x27;s a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you&#x27;re marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it&#x27;s a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

                              <span>Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I&#x27;m so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can&#x27;t grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I&#x27;m so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.</span>

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member&#x27;s library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…</span>

                              <span>Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey&#x27;s Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory&#x27;s Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,&quot; Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you&#x27;re a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game&#x27;s metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there&#x27;s a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

                              <span>SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it&#x27;s due out in &quot;early 2025&quot; as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today&#x27;s, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game&#x27;s new &quot;REV&quot; system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we&#x27;ll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK&#x27;s original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year.

But just like waiting for a bus, suddenly two come along at once. The first aims to block Australians&#x27; view of more than 30 pirate sites, a disproportionate number serving the pirate anime market. A brand-new application sees Apple in a surprise partnership with Hollywood and Netflix, because everyone has exclusives to protect these days.

                              <span>A heaving expo floor is not a great place to sample a first-person open world hunting game that wants you to monitor your own heartbeat, but The Axis Unseen manages to be pretty atmospheric regardless. It helps that I&#x27;m hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock. I only have a couple of arrows in my quiver, which doesn&#x27;t feel like nearly enough, so I edge across the hillside to another tree trunk, where I can hopefully line up a headshot.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to play a hardcore RPG that&#x27;s way above your brain&#x27;s pay grade, or got lost in tutorials that use complicated words and bizarre jargon, then you&#x27;ve probably felt right at home reading headlines about AI recently. Why are people angry that this character has seven fingers? Why does Nvidia want me to talk to a robot about ramen? Why is everyone saying AI is smart when it still can’t manage its Classical Era luxury resource economy in Civilization properly? In this new series, we’re going to explore what &#x27;generative AI&#x27; is, why it’s arrived now in the games industry, and what it might mean for people who make, write about and play games in the future.

                              <span>HoYoverse have announced that sign-ups for Zenless Zone Zero&#x27;s next closed beta test are now available. While the start and end dates of the next closed beta haven&#x27;t been unveiled just yet, we do know that there&#x27;s going to be a new character to play, a new faction, new missions, and overhauls to the game&#x27;s combat and exploration. I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s worth a look if you&#x27;re into Genshin Impact, or are into your anime fights. Either one will suffice.

                              <span>While cloud gaming is very much not at a point where I want it to be the main way I play games, if I ever will, I do appreciate having the convenience as an option. Being able to play a game away from my PC can be handy. So it&#x27;s neat that GOG have announced they&#x27;re teaming up with Amazon to make select GOG games playable through the Amazon Luna cloud gaming platform &quot;soon&quot;. Sure, I might be tempted to take a nice stroll through Night City while slouching about with my laptop that absolutely cannot run Cyberpunk 2077.

                              <span>Solo developer Billy Basso&#x27;s enigmatic Metroidvania Animal Well has been dated for May 9th, publishers Bigmode announced yesterday. In it, you&#x27;ll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it&#x27;s unclear both what you are, and why exactly you&#x27;re so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below.

                              <span>The Amazon Spring Sale is back, refreshed and renamed as Amazon Spring Deal Days. Maybe because there’s so many of them: this flowery festival of buying stuff begins on Wednesday March 20th and runs all the way through Monday March 25th. And I thought Prime Day was getting too long, sheesh.
On the upside, this should mean more chances topick up some quality PC gaming hardware on the cheap. Been putting off that new SSD or graphics card upgrade? Spring Deal Days is likely your best opportunity to exploit mass discounts until Summer.

                              <span>It&#x27;s GDC week over in San Francisco at the moment, and such a high concentration of video game developers in one place can only mean one thing: The Maw has turned its ever-dribbling gaze to America&#x27;s west coast, and is preparing to bask in all the fresh learnings being shared about how last year&#x27;s best video games were made and created. Edwin is one the ground there for us, so we wish him well in his news gathering and interview appointments. Back home, the news cycle still continues apace, with lots of great releases big and small coming up over the next seven days. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got our eyes on.

                              <span>A piracy-related court order obtained by Spanish football league LaLiga should&#x27;ve been relatively easy to explain. Instead, it now sits at the heart of a controversy that began with misinformation and is now being fueled by mischaracterization and misinterpretation. Today we&#x27;ll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

                              <span>Italian telco watchdog AGCOM has taken on the task of rolling out one of the largest piracy-blocking schemes the Internet has ever witnessed. The organization fiercely defends its IP-address blocking efforts and has full confidence in its technical expertise. Curiously, however, AGCOM&#x27;s domain name is only partly functioning, as it explicitly requires a www subdomain.

My years of GDC left me devestated by the full realisation of how bad Mexican food is in the UK and I&#x27;m still not over it. Even the &#x27;fancy&#x27; tacos and burritos you find nowadays cannot stand up to whichever burrito joint was closest to the BART station, especially as those were $7 and you&#x27;ll pay £15 for a bad burrito here. Just. God. I miss them. I miss them so much. And the grackles. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>BitTorrent is no longer the &#x27;King&#x27; of upstream traffic. New data published by Canadian broadband management company Sandvine reveals that cloud storage, YouTube, and other apps have taken over. This marks the end of a period of declining dominance that started two decades ago when BitTorrent reportedly accounted for a third of all web traffic.

A remarkable investigation followed as Bungie tracked down the perpetrator.

While the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the $1 billion damages award, it kept the contributory copyright infringement ruling intact. This precedent results in a &quot;draconian regime&quot; that threatens the Internet connectivity of millions of people, Cox warns.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it&#x27;s narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses &quot;The Hero&quot; of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, the &quot;Two Nations,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Monsters&quot; that players will be killing plenty of during their journey.

Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024.

After that, read about how Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has just one save file.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it&#x27;s great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
&quot;Photo mode returns in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II,&quot; a Ninja Theory tweet reads. &quot;Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week.&quot; 
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive. The deal apparently carried with it a $500 million price tag, according to a Bloomberg report. 
Now, it&#x27;s official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports. 


Embracer sold Saber Interactive to Beacon Interactive for $247 million, but there was an option for the former to bring Metro series developer…</span>

Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it&#x27;s working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game&#x27;s launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them.

I&#x27;ve only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it&#x27;s immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I&#x27;m sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who&#x27;s ever despaired at Noctis&#x27; seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…</span>

                              <span>If you’ve ever suspected that harvesting crops in Stardew Valley is faster in one direction than another, validation is at hand. The beloved farming sim’s creator has confirmed that the long-rumoured quirk is real, as its incoming 1.6 update prepares to fix a bug dating back almost a decade.

                              <span>Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn&#x27;t feel much like conflict at all. It&#x27;s just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you&#x27;re trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it&#x27;s a form of redemptive self-expression. The game&#x27;s fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside.

It&#x27;s one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It&#x27;s made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.

                              <span>What do you reach for when you&#x27;re waiting in line at the supermarket, or waiting in a shop doorway for the rain to stop, or even while you&#x27;re waiting for a game to finish downloading? I don&#x27;t mean to assume, but let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s probably your phone, where some idle doomscrolling likely awaits you, or some other, time-wasting distraction that will help fill the dead air between one task and the next. Well, While Waiting is a game that delves into precisely this fundamental human question: what is the best thing to do while waiting for something else to happen? It&#x27;s from the makers of the very good puzzle game Moncage, and its newly released Steam demo is a pure, fidgety brilliance.

                              <span>My day in Lightyear Frontier starts out with a bit of farming. On a good day, it’s raining, so I don’t need to water the crops. On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.
My goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.

                              <span>I know that &quot;Made one guy admit he was wrong about a subgenre&quot; isn’t the kind of achievement they put in accolade trailers, but I must credit Warhammer 40,000: Darktide with tearing apart my blanket dislike of first-person melee fighters. Having spent months of stubbornly maining Veteran and sticking as closely as possible to FPS convention, I’ve since found peace in the simple act of swinging knives/swords/giant electrified hammers into and through people. Mainly because it’s not so simple: for all its chaotic spectacle, the meleeing in Darktide (this month’s RPS Game Club star) works because it’s secretly been a rhythm game.

That makes it twice as long as Steam&#x27;s spring sale, which also started today. I&#x27;m not sure if that makes it twice as exciting, but here&#x27;s what does: Deus Ex Mankind Divided is free to keep for the next week.

                              <span>Helldivers 2&#x27;s Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there&#x27;s a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. 
Still, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.

                              <span>You wouldn’t know because she hardly ever mentions it, but Alice Bee is not a Ready Player One fan. In fairness, the newly revealed Open (or Opthreen), an RPO-themed metaverse battle royale thing, does look, sound, feel, and smell horrible, so a solid chunk of this week’s Electronic Wireless Show podcast is just us despairing over it. But there’s also some honest-to-goodness games chat, as we field a question from EWS listener Pete (thanks Pete!) on the games our younger selves were parentally forbidden from playing – and how we feel about them as ostensible grownups.

                              <span>The studio behind unexpectedly decent Mickey Mouse life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley are venturing into another fantasy land where anthropomorphic animals adventure with human chums, the Forgotten Realms setting of Dungeons &amp; Dungeons. Today Gameloft announced they&#x27;re making a D&amp;D game offering a &quot;hybrid of survival, life simulation and action RPG&quot;. They don&#x27;t have much more to share about the game, not even a name, so presumably it won&#x27;t be out for some time. Whatever it might be, it&#x27;s headed to PC and consoles.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s announcement that Embracer are selling off Saber Interactive to new company Beacon Interactive has cast further doubt over the future of one of Embracer&#x27;s bigger projects, the much-delayed Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic remake. While Embracer have yet to actually state this out loud, it sounds like the KOTOR remake will be a &quot;joint project&quot; between Saber and Embracer. It also probably won&#x27;t be out in the next 12 months. Given the project&#x27;s repeated disruptions and delays, I suspect many of us will settle for the game coming out at all.

                              <span>Welcome to the third and final part of my Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 hands-on diary, in which I heroically try to make headway in Capcom&#x27;s outsized fantasy RPG with a party of pure magic-users. I am Dragonkin Skywalker - telekinetic Mystic Spearhand, oxcart patron and an extremely bad thief. Joining me on the adventure are three AI-controlled pawns - the diabolical fury that is Donald Duck, the levitating liability that is Galadriel, Queen of the Woods, and the class act that is celebrity stage magician David Blaine, all of whom I have given new and stupid names plucked from my vast knowledge of wizardry across different entertainment fields.

                              <span>Crow Country and its spooky, mutant-stuffed theme park will be opening its gates on Steam on May 9th, developers SFB Games have announced. It&#x27;s the first of two games from the Tangle Tower micro-studio coming to PC this year, the other one being The Mermaid&#x27;s Tongue, which will be picking up the adventures of their Tangle Tower detective duo on a marginally less spooky-looking submarine later this year. Crow Country, however, is a very different kettle of fish, combining chunky, PS1-style Final Fantasy 7 character models with early Resident Evil tank controls and panicked monster shooting.

                              <span>Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you&#x27;ll find a world that&#x27;s more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it&#x27;s been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they&#x27;d all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017&#x27;s remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning&#x27;s version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It&#x27;s no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you&#x27;ll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.
A shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain&#x27;t.

It was a bit of cosy fun for a group of pals, and thankfully, open-ended co-op play looks to be the focus of the next big update, which adds a new sandbox mode that lets you pick rocks and sink pints free of storyline constraints. Not to mention new armour, weapons, and quality of life improvements like the ability to pause your single player sessions.

                              <span>Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. It&#x27;s being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an &quot;innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.&quot;
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you&#x27;re a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there&#x27;s a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&amp;D setting Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature &quot;unique cooperative gameplay,&quot; the studio says. 
&quot;Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,&quot; the announcement reads.&quot; 
There&#x27;s no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&amp;D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&amp;D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&amp;D game released was Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer&#x27;s review of it here.

                              <span>In 2023, Sega Sammy Holdings acquired Rovio, subsequently making the famed Angry Birds developer a subsidiary of Sega Europe. While Sega&#x27;s Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega&#x27;s other mascots (see below), we haven&#x27;t seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds&#x27; eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic&#x27;s world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…</span>

That&#x27;s according to a new &quot;Notice of End of Sales&quot; post on the game&#x27;s Steam page. From Friday, March 29, 2024, onward, the game will no longer be available for purchase in Japan on the storefront. 
However, online play will remain available after the game&#x27;s delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store. 
Released less than two years ago on August 30, 2022, on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, The Cowabunga Collection getting delisted so soon comes as a shock. However, it&#x27;s seemingly only affecting TMNT players in Japan. Game Informer reached out to publisher Konami to ask if there are plans to delist the game outside …</span>

                              <span>The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you&#x27;re a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you&#x27;ll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio&#x27;s first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

                              <span>In the wake of its one-week lawsuit targeting the Yuzu Switch emulator, Nintendo is back to clean up the house. The company has just shut down around 30 GitHub repos offering circumvention tools with attempts to evade liability given short shrift. One Nintendo takedown notice makes it clear that, even when people link to a third-party site that hosts tools available via different links, it still amounts to trafficking in circumvention devices under the DMCA.

For several months, the movie has been widely available on pirate sites too. While one might think that all demand would be satisfied, winning the Oscar for &#x27;Best Picture&#x27; more than doubled the interest on pirate sites this week. The same Oscar boost affects other titles as well.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that a little hand for a cursor is better than left-handed FPS options. I dearly hope that when you clicked on your vote, your Windows cursor was a little gauntlet or skeletal hand or such. Onwards! This week, I ask you about grabbing (and poking, pulling, burning, pressing, activating, and otherwise using) stuff. What&#x27;s better, highlighted interactive objects or retrievable reusable ammo?

                              <span>I’m not personally familiar with Nexon’s 2010 MMO Vindictus, but its upcoming action-RPG spin-off Vindictus: Defying Fate is looking like a fairly flashy mix of Celtic mythology, dodge-and-slash swordplay and some sharp visuals. Luckily for me and you, we’ll be able to give it a go for free for the next week, as the game’s pre-alpha playtest is now live over on Steam.

After checking the game out for a few hours alongside some of the leads at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, last month, cover story writer and Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart and I have a pretty good idea about what to expect from No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s early access release – you can read my preview thoughts here and his cover story here.
We&#x27;re both excited for the release, too. It&#x27;s a fun game so far, and it&#x27;s a unique approach for Moon Studios. No Rest for the Wicked tech and production director and Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol and studio CEO and c…</span>

                              <span>Developer Ubisoft Montpellier&#x27;s excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it&#x27;s still one of Game Informer&#x27;s top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. 
What&#x27;s more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. 
However, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. 
It&#x27;s an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. 
It seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a &quot;Shrieker Lair&quot; is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like &quot;smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.&quot; 


Shrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. 
Keep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game. After that, check out the Cutting Edge Warbond coming to the game tomorrow.

                              <span>V Rising hit Early Access on PC in 2022, selling more than 1.5 million copies in just two weeks. Since then, the game has continued to garner attention from players for its great mix of survival mechanics and action-RPG combat. Now, just shy of two years in Early Access, V Rising will launch into 1.0 in May. 
More specifically, V Rising transitions into 1.0 on May 8. We learned during a State of Play in January that developer Stunlock Studios&#x27; vampire game would be coming to PlayStation 5 this year, and today&#x27;s announcement further affirms the team is confident it will hit the platform in 2024. 
Check it out in the official V Rising release date trailer for yourself below, courtesy of IGN: 


V Rising is currently available to purchase via Early Access on PC before it launches into 1.0 on May 8. It hits PS5 later this year.

                              <span>Sabotage Studio has teased a new three-player co-op mode for its 2023 RPG Sea of Stars alongside news the game has surpassed 5 million players in less than a year. This new mode, dubbed Single Player+, lets three players journey together through the story of Sea of Stars, and it will feature new traversal and combat mechanics to accommodate playing with friends. 
Sabotage announced this news today with a special teaser trailer you can watch below. In it, you&#x27;ll get a glimpse of what Sea of Stars&#x27; Single Player+ mode looks like, how it works, and what to expect. Check it out: 


&quot;Staying true to the game&#x27;s core turn-based roots, each player will engage in traversal and combat with a new &#x27;co-op timed hits&#x27; mechanic as they embark with friends on Sea of Stars&#x27; grand adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The new mode is currently in development and more details are set to be released soon.&quot; 
As you can see, Sabotage isn&#x27;t quite ready to reveal when this new mode will hit the game. After all, the team is still working on Throes of the Watchmaker, a new DLC coming to the game sometime in the future.

                              <span>PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. 
The biggest features are coming to the PS5&#x27;s DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller&#x27;s built-in mic has been improved. 


&quot;The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.&quot;
Share Screen is also getting some new features with today&#x27;s update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host&#x27;s screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. 
Finally, today&#x27;s update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. 


For more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a &quot;V2 DualSense&quot; with a 12-hour battery life. After that, read about how the PS5 surpassed 50 million units in December, and then check out Game Informer&#x27;s top 10 PS5 games to play right now.

Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.

                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>

                              <span>OpenTTD 14.0 comes with a new ship pathfinder which allows ships to travel great distances without the use of buoys. Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.</span>
