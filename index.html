                              <span>The Callisto Protocol is one of the most anticipated horror games in years and happens to be our June cover story. One of the project’s more intriguing aspects was that it canonically took place in the same universe as popular battle royale PUBG: Battlegrounds, albeit in the distant future and on another planet. As of today, that’s no longer the case.
Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. 
FYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world. It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world. PUBG is awesome, &amp;we will still have little surprises for fans, but TCP is its own world, story and universe.

No one would deny that the (once) cult horror franchise that is The Evil Dead is deserving of its legendary status, but it also cannot be denied that its frequent entries into the video game world have certainly left something to be desired. While each movie, from Sam Raimi&#x27;s seminal 1983 classic to Fede Álvarez&#x27;s great 2013 remake, has brought iconic characters, delirious carnage, and bucketfuls of the red stuff, the video game exploits of franchise star Ash Williams have never quite lived up to the series&#x27; inherent potential.
From the original bland computer game (1984), through the boring and cumbersome Hail to the King (2000), the blah Fistful of Boomstick (2003), and the tepid Evil Dead Regeneration (2005), the horror franchise has struggled to truly deliver the relentless, m…</span>

                              <span>Get caught up on the BioShock series in one fell swoop
The new Epic Games Store freebie is live, and it&#x27;s a three-for-one. BioShock: The Collection is free on Epic, now through June 2.
The Collection packages together BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2: Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition. All three versions of these games include all of their corresponding single-player DLC.
So alongside three immersive shooters, there are also some pretty solid DLC additions here, like Minerva&#x27;s Den for BioShock 2 and Burial at Sea for Infinite. Essentially, it&#x27;s a complete package of all things BioShock up to present day. And the first BioShock also includes a Director&#x27;s Commentary too.

There have been plenty of freebies handed out through the Epic Games Store&#x27;s giveaways, but the full BioShock is a pretty rad package. You can check it out via the Epic launcher or the link here. The next free game hasn&#x27;t been revealed yet, but will unlock a week from now, roughly.
There&#x27;s always a lighthouse
As for the BioShock series, well, we haven&#x27;t seen much of it since the conclusion of Infinite. A new BioShock has ostensibly been in development at Cloud Chamber, but it&#x27;s been some time since we heard anything about it.
So while its spiritual predecessors in games like System Shock are also in development, BioShock is up in the air. June is just around the corner, the perfect time for game announcements. But we&#x27;ve yet to see anything notable that could indicate news on the way.
For now, a return to Rapture is much more likely, thanks to this BioShock Epic freebie. Or, if you&#x27;re in a musical mood, you can check out the award-winning BioShock high school show choir adaptation. I mean, say what you want about any of the games, but BioShock does have some great music.

One of the things I love most about video games is that they have a whole new set of standards and conventions not shared by any other medium. Fail states, collectible bits of story in the form of journals or audio diaries, and randomly generated content are only a few examples of features that can only be found in an interactive medium, but today, I want to hone in on one factor of a game&#x27;s overall experience that has a special place in my heart — video game title screens.
A game&#x27;s title screen, also known as the start screen, is the first thing you&#x27;re going to see — you know, it&#x27;s what appears after you boot up the game but before you actually start playing it. It&#x27;s usually accompanied by music and some animations. Back in the arcade days, these title screens…</span>

It looks like you two characters... are going to Top Gun — or at least you will be if you frequent Microsoft Flight Simulator. The premier sky flying title has added a brand new DLC expansion themed after Paramount Pictures&#x27; new movie Top Gun: Maverick. Better still, the new DLC is free for all players.
Wannabee Icemen can earn their stripes in three new training missions, learning the ways of unrestricted take-offs, split S maneuvers, and low altitude, high-speed maneuvering. Once you&#x27;re pretty confident that you can take on any situation... inverted... then you can test your newfound abilities against five challenging &quot;High Speed/Low Level&quot; canyon runs, zipping through tight and unpredictable terrain at terrifying, break-neck speeds.

The video game adaptations to TV and film just don&#x27;t stop coming, because Sony announced today that they&#x27;re working in conjunction with Netflix to develop a Horizon Zero Dawn series. The news dropped today following Sony&#x27;s 2022 business presentation to investors, and was initially reported by David Gibson, a notable video game analyst. While Sony didn&#x27;t mention Horizon in the presentation documents, the slides did also mention several other projects that they have in the works.
According to the presentation, Sony also has a God of War series in development with Amazon Prime, as well as a Gran Turismo pitch that they are currently working on developing. When you consider the Ghost of Tsushima movie that has already be…</span>

Once again we&#x27;re in the pre-&quot;E3&quot; mode, as My Little Pony: A Maretime Bay Adventure hits the Switch tomorrow, May 27. To give you an idea of what kind of game it is, here&#x27;s a marketing bullet point: &quot;Two players can put on a fashion show, herd bunnies, and more!&quot; I kind of need to know what &quot;and more&quot; means!
Another cute mascot-ey game is arriving too, as Kao the Kangaroo arrives on the Switch eShop on the same day. Nintendo is also continuing to hype pre-orders for Sonic Origins on a weekly basis now, which is available on June 23. Growing up in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, I&#x27;m still frankly stunned that Nintendo is going so hard to push a Sega franchise. At least Sega is still independent and it&#x27;s not a &quot;Disney owns everything&quot; situation! Maybe I jinxed it. Please don&#x27;t look back in 10 years and blame this article for putting that out into the world.

                              <span>Are You Afraid of the Dark?
The super-cute, super-spoopy Japanese ghost story Yomawari 3 is officially headed to these shores. As announced by publisher NIS America, the freshly re-monikered Yomawari: Lost in the Dark will launch on PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch this fall, hopefully in time for Halloween!
As previously reported, Yomawari: LitD sees a young girl on an intrepid and spine-chilling quest to free her hometown from a mysterious curse. Armed with little more than steel nerves and a flashlight, our teeny hero must brave the avenues, alleyways, woodland, and interiors of the haunted town, gathering clues and learning the lore behind the town&#x27;s fate and her own part to play in its legacy.

Lacking in combat skills, our nameless protagonist must use cunning, guile, and the overwhelming power of closing their eyes in order to outwit and outmaneuver her ghostly opposition. Listen to your own heartbeat to detect oncoming presences  On the plus side, the character is fully customizable... So at least you can look fabulous while fighting off legions of the undead.
With a strong emphasis on tension, dread, and hair-raising chills over violent shocks and lame jump-scares, Lost in the Dark looks to be a delightfully creepy ghost story in the more classical horror sense, and may eventually prove to be the perfect title to play when you&#x27;re all safely snuggled up in bed on those cold fall nights.
Just don&#x27;t look under the bed.

                              <span>Following Patch 6.1
Final Fantasy XIV has been having some network hiccups lately. No, not nearly as catastrophic as the launch of Endwalker! But still notable to the point where the team is putting up a blog asking folks to send in reports of their own FFXIV network issues.
As is the case with many missives, the game&#x27;s own producer Naoki &quot;Yoshi P&quot; Yoshida took to the game&#x27;s blog to notify users of &quot;network-related issues,&quot; including packet loss and lag. The culprit is patch 6.1, which was implemented back on April 12. So far, this is the result of their investigation:
&quot;Based on the information that most of the recent reports are specifically coming from Japan, while others are playing without issue, the network-related issues may be due to the network routing. In the past month, some of the internet service providers (ISP) in Japan have been reporting issues due to high network concentration or trouble related to construction. That said, it may still be possible for us to contact the ISP and work together to see if we can resolve the issues.&quot;
However, if you&#x27;re having FFXIV network issues, Yoshi P says you should report them here under the &quot;providing information on packet loss and lag&quot; topic. The blog then walks users through how to provide traceroute info (/run tracert). Hopefully they figure it out and it doesn&#x27;t impact you!

                              <span>&quot;Atropos&quot; and &quot;Helios&quot; were spotted on a code-named SteamDB page that fits the bill
It feels like a matter of time before Sony and Housemarque bring Returnal over to PC, and today, we&#x27;re one step closer to that port becoming a reality. As spotted by @Nibellion, a listing on SteamDB contains references to the adrenaline-pumping PS5 exclusive.
While the SteamDB page uses the codename &quot;Oregon,&quot; it includes specific words and phrases related to Returnal including &quot;Atropos&quot; (the alien planet), &quot;Helios&quot; (Selene&#x27;s ship), and the &quot;Tower of Sisyphus&quot; (an endless mode recently added to Returnal on PS5).
Additionally, this presumed Returnal PC build has on-brand Steam tags like &quot;Third-Person Shooter,&quot; &quot;Bullet Hell,&quot; &quot;Sci-fi,&quot; &quot;Rogue-lite,&quot; and &quot;Female Protagonist.&quot;

                              <span>Warning: Statue is Top Heavy
Yesterday saw Arc System Works make a series of announcements pertaining to its flash fight franchise Guilty Gear. In addition to the news that a huge, gameplay-changing update is headed to Guilty Gear Strive for the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, the stream also took the time to talk about some cool upcoming toys, figurines, and statues for the Guilty Gear die-hard&#x27;s bookshelf.
Leading the pack was the announcement of a massive 1/6 scale Guilty Gear statue of the wandering samurai Baiken. Currently in the works at Union Creative, the statue is set to be pretty damn huge, in more ways than one, and (according to the image used) will likely depict the buxom warrior in the thick of the fight — rising to her feet to deal another mighty blow. Given the recent pricing…</span>

                              <span>I wish I could challenge him directly
As a kid, I had an affinity for those &quot;button mashing&quot; challenges. You know the ones where in some fighting games you&#x27;d &quot;clash,&quot; and the best masher would win? Or any number of Mario Party minigames? Whenever one of the latter would show up in one of my friend groups, someone tried to sabotage me by grabbing my controller because they knew their defeat was inevitable — but I think it&#x27;s time to recognize the master button masher.
Takahashi Meijin is a legend that&#x27;s been in the industry for decades, making his name at Hudson Soft. He&#x27;s perhaps most famous for the &quot;16 shot per second&quot; mashing technique. In short, Takahashi-san managed to mash so quickly that he could trigger &quot;16 shots per second,&quot; and actually put it on film in the &#x27;80s.
Well, the master button masher is back at it again. In a tweet (from his account meijin_16shot), he shows that even at age 63, he&#x27;s still got it: absolutely crushing the Mario Party SuperStars minigame Pokey Pummel. That face of accomplishment at the end! I can only hope to still be playing games this capably at that age.

                              <span>I&#x27;m still in spoiler mode for now
Even though tons of people have played Elden Ring, I&#x27;m still in spoiler mode. So consider this a warning, as famed From Software director Hidetaka Miyazaki just shared his favorite Elden Ring boss with everyone today, and we&#x27;re going to talk about it!

Thanks to an interview from Xbox Wire, straight from Miyazaki&#x27;s mouth, we know that his favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, or just &quot;Radahn.&quot; I can see why!
Radahn made a huge impact on me when I was playing, to the point where, once the game was fully out, I told our own Jordan Devore &quot;there&#x27;s a boss in the game that is unlike any other from the SekiSoulsBornes, you&#x27;ll know it when you see it.&quot; Miyazaki says that he loves the whole vibe with Radahn, that it&#x27;s centered around a festival, and the juxtaposition of the loneliness of the character and the upbeat nature of the festival itself. The concept of a melancholy celebration sounds like an extremely Miyazaki thing.
He says that if he had to pick a runner-up, it would be Godrick the Grafted (one of the first bosses you can fight) or Rykard Lord of Blasphemy (the snake). Both great choices! I mean, if you ask any 100 people what their favorite EldenSekiSoulsBorne boss is, you&#x27;re going to get an array of answers. Well, possibly zero votes for the Fire Giant, but an array nonetheless!

It&#x27;s time to get stylish and strike a pose. JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R will get the action started on Sept. 2, 2022 for consoles and one day prior on PC.
Bandai Namco announced the news today with a new trailer, showcasing all the different eras of JoJo&#x27;s. Alongside the familiar faces, the likes of Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, four new fighters were revealed as well.
Joining the roster of All-Star Battle R is Robert E.O. Speedwagon from Phantom Blood; Mariah and Pet Shop from Stardust Crusaders; and Diego Brando, from Steel Ball Run.

                              <span>If you can dig out your Xbox 360, have at it
Fans battle constantly over what constitutes the &quot;worst Sonic games in the series,&quot; and many have narrowed it down to Sonic &#x27;06 at the top of the list; otherwise known as Sonic the Hedgehog. Helmed by Yuji Naka, Sega attempted to make both a 15th anniversary blowout game and a &quot;serious&quot; take on the franchise, and both blew up in their faces. It got so bad that the game is only remembered today by the general public as &quot;the game where Sonic kisses a human woman,&quot; and Sega subsequently delisted the game (among others it deemed critical failures). Until now. Sonic reloaded? More like Sonic relisted.
Mysteriously, thanks to a fan tip, we&#x27;ve learned that Sonic &#x27;06 is back on the menu as a Sonic relisted special, as clear as day, alongside of a ton of &quot;picture packs&quot; (remember those?) and even some DLC. The kicker is that it&#x27;s on Xbox 360 (sans backward compatibility), and it&#x27;s five bucks.
Depending on who you ask, this is where the Sonic series took a sharp decline. Sonic Adventure 2 and Heroes didn&#x27;t quite ruin the series&#x27; reputation despite their flaws, but following this we got Sonic and the Black Knight, as well as Sonic Unleashed — which drew the ire of Sonic fans across the world. Of course, some say the fall happened earlier, with November 2005&#x27;s Shadow the Hedgehog.
In any case, Sonic &#x27;06 is where it reached critical mass and people weren&#x27;t going to take it anymore. But for the sake of game preservation, Sega shouldn&#x27;t hide their history. They should remember it, learn from it, and make it available to posterity. In other words: &quot;please be good, Sonic Frontiers.&quot;

If you forgot that Capcom announced another compilation a few months ago, I wouldn&#x27;t blame you. It feels like Sega and Capcom could subside on retro re-releases alone, given how heavily they dominated that era of gaming. But we were given access to a Capcom Fighting Collection preview edition, and things are looking up in terms of its adherence to preservation; and for Darkstalkers fans.

As a recap, here are the games included in the Capcom Fighting Collection:
Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors
Night Warriors: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire
Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers’ Revenge
Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire
Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition
Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo

For me, one of the most devastating delays this year has been Two Point Campus. I know, I know, three months isn’t the end of the world. I just had to start up its predecessor, Two Point Hospital, and cry a lot.
Sega and Two Point Studios have my back. They gave Destructoid the opportunity to check out a bit of their upcoming game, which I jumped on. I need it. Right in my veins.

I was also given the chance to talk to Mark Webley and Chris Knott, studio director, and senior animator respectively. Both veterans in their own right, having worked on games like the Fable series and The Movies. Mark Webley goes all the way back to Syndicate in 1993 and, of course, Theme Hospital in 1997. He couldn’t tell me why we can’t buy The Movie…</span>

                              <span>Two of which are to be expected this fiscal year
Sony Interactive Entertainment held its latest investor call this morning, in which president Jim Ryan spoke to shareholders and press about some of the corporation&#x27;s plans for the PlayStation brand going forward. Among the many topics discussed was the company&#x27;s newfound love of Live Service titles, of which Sony is expecting to produce many more in the coming few years.
As transcribed and reported by news outlet VGC, Ryan stated that Sony has two live service titles currently planned for release by the end of the fiscal year (which will be March 2023). When asked whether Destiny — property of the newly-acquired Bungie Studios — is included as one of these two incoming releases, Ryan said that these particular live service titles were as-ye…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s time for a vibe check
Over the years, Tarsier Studios has become one of those predictably unpredictable game makers that I&#x27;m always eager to check in on. The Malmö, Sweden-based studio has been quiet since wrapping up Little Nightmares II for Bandai Namco (which may or may not continue the series elsewhere, given all of its success), but we&#x27;re expecting new IPs.
This week on Twitter, Tarsier Studios shared a new teaser video with a coy message: &quot;We&#x27;ve been busy.&quot; Presumably, it&#x27;s a vibe check for the next big game idea.

While I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to classify the blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-&#x27;em clips, the visual concepts are dark and intriguing in a very Tarsier way. I&#x27;m sticking with the &quot;Horror&quot; tag for this article, and we&#x27;…</span>

                              <span>The strongest (and priciest) woman in the world
Deluxe merch-maker Prime 1 Studio is back again, bringing with it the latest release in their stunning range of premium &quot;Masterline&quot; character statues. Following on from 2021&#x27;s attractive diorama of Devil May Cry&#x27;s Dante, this new statue immortalizes one of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time, Street Fighter&#x27;s Chun-Li.
Standing at 1/4 scale (roughly 30 inches in height, including base), this gorgeous statue depicts The Strongest Woman in the World as she appears in Street Fighter V, bedecked in her classic Street Fighter II costume and daubed in its alternate pink coloring. The highly dynamic posing sees Chunners flowing with powerful energy, just a frame away from unleashing her devastating Critical Art attack.

Clearly, the fight has raged for quite some time, as our hero stands atop the debris of a decimated &quot;Bustling Side Street&quot; stage. The K.O. is most assuredly close. This Limited Edition also comes packaged with an alternate head, allowing fans to pose the Interpol agent in full focused combat mode, or coyly winking at the hapless opponent about to get sent into the stratosphere.
Now, the damage. The Premium Masterline Street Fighter V Chun-Li Pink Costume Limited Edition statue (phew) is no slouch on the wallet, retailing for a princely $1,099 USD (not including shipping). Truly limited, the statue has a meager format size of only 150, so she will be quite rare, even by premium statue standards. If you are a die-hard fan of the battlin&#x27; babe, then you can place your pre-order over on the official Prime 1 Studio store right now. Payment options are available, with Chunners expected to ship in late-2022/early 2023.
Yatta!

It&#x27;s a multiplayer variant where both players take it in turns to guess words on the same board, which means that each helpful guess you make is also helping your opponent.

This is a chonker of a roguelike RPG, in which long-held assumptions about how the genre ought to be designed are thrown away, while others are strictly obeyed. The designers of this colourful &#x27;splorer have rubbed their chins and decided to see what our beloved randomly generated death tales would look like without two sacred cows: money and meters. Folks, it looks kinda good.

                              <span>A digital artist has created a stylish mockup of a roguelike (maybe even a Roguelike) which looks like printed screenshots in a magazine. It&#x27;s a pretty little thing, though I should stress it is only a mockup to demonstrate a shader, not an actual game. But still, come, watch.

The announcement was tweeted by Supermassive this afternoon, saying the mode will now added &quot;by July 8th&quot; at the latest. No reason was given other than wanting to &quot;deliver the best possible experience&quot; for players.

It seems the offending boss in this particular instance is Ungora the Spider Queen, a high-level giant arachnid (the worst kind) who’s set up a fetching gothic domicile in the Cursed Forest’s Spider Cave. According to the mission summary for Ungola: “No living creature save for her children has ever entered and lived to tell the tale.” That’s enough to put anyone off.

Ne&#x27;er touch the muffin pan since. No, of course it&#x27;s our favourite video games that made big swings but didn&#x27;t quite hit, a Nate Crowley-backed themed - and he kicks us off with a bid discussion about the infamous Jurassic Park tie-in game Trespasser. Try spelling &quot;jurassic&quot; properly first time; I&#x27;ve never been able too. 
Diversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew&#x27;s life could have been different if only he&#x27;d been Wookey Hole&#x27;s witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is &quot;about as big as an Alsatian&quot; and &quot;basically a bin-bag full of girders&quot;. So he is turning it into an Orc sewage treatment plant. Standard week to be honest.

                              <span>It&#x27;s tempting to make a bunch of jokes about Two Point Campus in the vein of, &quot;A nudist knight and a wizard studying the dark arts? Sounds like my freshman year!&quot; and then chortle at the open mic night audience. It&#x27;s also tempting to say something like, &quot;You know Two Point Hospital? It&#x27;s like that, but at a university,&quot; but that would also be the lazy way out. In reality, the weirdest person I knew at uni only wore a top hat and an opera cape to campus once as a joke (and now has a proper job), and Two Point Campus is actually a way more complex and weird management sim than Two Point Studios&#x27; previous - and indeed, ongoing - hospital effort.

                              <span>When I saw the new Scream film earlier this year, the audience was a mix of zoomers sitting at the back giggling at how rubbish it was, and people my age and older fighting the urge to go, &quot;No, see, it&#x27;s actually really cool and good how they say what the plot is and then that actually is the plot!&quot; There were just too many layers to peel off the metafictional onion for a generation who didn&#x27;t love the original Scream from 1996. Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like &#x27;prestige&#x27; horror like The Babadook.
I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022. And, preferably, stars pro-wrestler and part-time actor David Arquette. This week I played some of The Quarry.

You’ll be able to recruit these leviathans for your capital ship’s frigate fleet, and even keep a baby version as a pet inside your base. Witness them in the trailer below.

                              <span>Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going &#x27;cheap&#x27; on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you&#x27;ll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. 
My colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you&#x27;re forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect.

Early Access games can be scary — ever heard of &quot;too many cooks&quot;, except all the cooks are gamers? — but they can also result in some lovingly-polished games that don&#x27;t make it to Switch until they&#x27;re really, really good.

On the surface, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma looks like any other 2010s RPG. It&#x27;s got dragons, it&#x27;s got swords, it&#x27;s got side quests. You&#x27;ve played Skyrim. You&#x27;ve played Dark Souls. You know what to expect.

It&#x27;s 27th May in Japan, which means the Dragon Quest series is celebrating its 36th anniversary! And to kick things off, Square Enix has dropped a brand new teaser for its previously announced spin-off, Dragon Quest Treasures.

The Reggie Fils-Aimé book tour train just keeps on chugging away! Last week, the former president of Nintendo of America sat down with GamesIndustry.biz&#x27;s James Batchelor for a chat following the release of his book, Distrupting the Game, to talk about not just the book but various industry issues and the future of Nintendo.
Towards the end of the podcast, James asks Reggie a question that&#x27;s inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s recent financial results and the current president of Nintendo&#x27;s comments on transitioning to a new console generation. The Switch is one of Nintendo&#x27;s best-selling consoles ever, even outselling the hugely successful Wii, and the company has often stumbled when following up some of its best systems — the Wii U, for example, tripped over the Wii&#x27;s success.

JanduSoft Games has announced Astronite, a Metroidvania with heavy Gato Roboto vibes, coming to Switch this October. No firm release date has been set at the time of writing, however we do have confirmation that a physical edition of the game will also be launched alongside the digital version.
The game will be a classic take on the Metroidvania genre, with collectible items, various zones, and fearsome bosses all featuring throughout. Here&#x27;s some more info on Astronite to give you a flavour:

The Star Fox series has not been given the best love from Nintendo over the years. With the popularity of Star Fox 64, fans were expecting a brand new 3D rail shooter on the N64&#x27;s successor, the GameCube. Instead, Nintendo&#x27;s then-collaborator Rare created something fans weren&#x27;t expecting — Star Fox Adventures, a fully 3D action-adventure game in the style of the Zelda series.
Nowadays, Rare&#x27;s final Nintendo title (and its only GameCube game) is looked back upon pretty fondly despite how starkly different it is compared to the first two games in the Star Fox series. So fondly, in fact, that the fan community has created something truly spectacular, inspired by Fox McCloud&#x27;s adventure.

                              <span>Poor, neglected souls.
There&#x27;s something quite satisfying about owning a particularly rare video game, isn&#x27;t there? Not so much in the sense that you can brag to your friends about owning something they couldn&#x27;t possibly hope to get their hands on; no, that&#x27;s quite insufferable, if you ask us. Rather, the idea of owning something valuable and precious, taking the effort to look after it and keep it in good condition is a wholly different story.
We&#x27;d be willing to bet that quite a few of you lovely readers probably own a rare video game or a rare piece of merchandise of some sort. We&#x27;d also be willing to bet that most of you would much rather keep hold of such an item for as long as possible, regardless of its potential value. After all, owning something of such prestige from a beloved IP means something, right? It makes us feel connected to a franchise we love in a way that&#x27;s particularly difficult to replicate.

Industry legend Takahashi Meijin, known for his work with Hudson Soft alongside his &#x27;16 shot per second&#x27; trigger finger, proves he&#x27;s still got what it takes to mash buttons at the age of 63.
In a video shared on Twitter, Meijin tackles the Pokey Pummel mini-game in Mario Party Superstars, blasting through the game in just 5.16 seconds. While not a world record, as such, it proves that age hasn&#x27;t slowed him down one bit (heh...), and watching his trigger finger at work is a true marvel.

                              <span>History takes flight.
In a huge discovery for video game history, a playable version of a long-lost cancelled N64 game has been found. SimCopter 64 was meant to be a port of the Maxis and EA title on PC and was last seen at E3 in — wait for it — 1997.
We were made aware of this by Twitter user and gaming history preservationist @dangentemp, who shared the find on the social media platform along with the Reddit thread it came from. Along with SimCopter 64, Maxis&#x27; SimCity was also due to get a 64DD port, which SimCopter would be compatible with, but neither of these saw the light of day.

We love a bit of history here at Nintendo Life, particularly when it&#x27;s something to do with our favourite hobby: knitting. No, we&#x27;re kidding, video games of course!
Many of us may not have been around when the NES first came out (this writer was born three years after its western release), so it&#x27;s always cool when bits of information regarding the console&#x27;s manufacturing process make their way online.

Pac-Man Museum+ is out on the Nintendo Switch this week. It&#x27;s a compilation of 14 titles from Pac-Man&#x27;s 40-year history.
To help build up some excitement, Bandai Namco has released a lovely new launch trailer - inspired by this collection. It&#x27;s also got plenty of Pac-Man-themed music throughout it, and at the end of the trailer, you can also see there&#x27;s an in-game launch bonus - available for a limited time.

The Switch Online retro library is slowly growing in size, and while a lot of the focus has been on the N64 and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis libraries, it seems Nintendo could possibly be preparing a NES and SNES update.
The Twitter account NinStatusBot - which is used to track maintenance and server outages for Nintendo&#x27;s network services - has revealed that scheduled maintenance for NES and SNES will be taking place on the 27th of May (aka tomorrow). Unsurprisingly, it&#x27;s already sent social media into a frenzy.

Although Masahiro Sakurai is now done with Smash Bros. Ultimate, it seems like he may not be slowing down any time soon.
In a bit of an update on social media, the director of Nintendo&#x27;s all-star Smash Bros. series revealed how he recently had an online meeting with his former employer, HAL Laboratory. He had no need to necessarily make this public, but he has, which has already led to some speculation online.

It&#x27;s a busy year for Sonic the Hedgehog, but somehow the blue blur still has time to take questions from his loyal fanbase. In fact, between 25th May and 2nd June, Sega Japan will be taking questions on his behalf (via social media) - allowing fans to ask the VTuber version of him anything they want for a special &#x27;Sonic Speed Q&amp;A&#x27;, taking place on 24th June on YouTube.
To ask a question, there is a bit of a catch - you&#x27;ll need to tweet while using the hashtag #音速一問一答. You don&#x27;t even need to follow the Sonic Official JP Twitter account and you can alternatively submit a question via the official Sonic Channel website. Keep in mind, that Sonic will be responding to these questions in Japanese, he&#x27;ll likely only respond to questions about himself, and most of his responses will likely be brief.

                              <span>No stranger to Star Wars or the annual celebration happening right now in Anaheim, CA, Harrison Ford made a surprise appearance at the Lucasfilm Showcase today, but he didn&#x27;t show up for a space-faring adventure this time around. Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.
Ford&#x27;s segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. &quot;I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,&quot; said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. &quot;I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I&#x27;ll be seeing you around campus.&quot;
Ford says they&#x27;ve almost finished the next Indy film. &quot;I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,&quot; who is also here. &quot;I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I&#x27;ll be seeing you around campus.&quot;
May 26, 2022
Before leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today&#x27;s panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?
Right now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.</span>

                              <span>Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show&#x27;s cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.
The teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor&#x27;s life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna&#x27;s Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O&#x27;Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.
“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor
May 26, 2022
The opening panel for this year&#x27;s Celebration wasn&#x27;t streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.
Andor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.

The wait to be reunited with them again, however, will be a little longer than expected. The Mandalorian&#x27;s third season won&#x27;t hit this year. The first episode is now officially slated to release in February 2023. 
This news comes from the first day of Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim, Calif. The series&#x27; creators, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, took to the stage in front of a packed theater to deliver the update. Actor Rosario Dawson also appeared in full Jedi makeup from the set of Ahsoka to reveal it would also be hitting in 2023, but no month was given.
Filoni and Favreau then surprised the crowd with the announcement of a new show called Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. This Disney Plus show is scheduled to launch in 2023 and will star Jude Law. It&#x27;s yet another project touched by Favreau and Filoni and also has Jon Watts and Christopher Ford serving as executive producers. You can see the official teaser image below:</span>

                              <span>Supermassive Games’ The Quarry launches in just a couple of weeks and serves as a campy (as in a literal summer camp) spiritual successor to Until Dawn. While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.
The studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.

The full statement reads as follows:
While a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. 
The Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here. Be sure to also read about how you can finish the game without pressing a button.</span>

                              <span>Deadline is reporting actor Ray Liotta has passed away at the age of 67.
Liotta died in his sleep while filming a movie called Dangerous Waters in the Dominican Republic. According to a source that has spoken with TMZ, there is &quot;nothing suspicious about the death, and no foul play is suspected.&quot; The cause of death remains unknown at this time.
Liotta had a prolific acting career. Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. 
Although his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games&#x27; Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta&#x27;s portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer&#x27;s 2002 Game of the Year. It&#x27;s sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.
Liotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo. Game Informer offers our condolences to Liotta&#x27;s family and friends in this trying time.</span>

                              <span>In Jurassic World: Primal Ops, dinosaurs once again roam the world, and humanity is learning what it&#x27;s like to live alongside them. You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.
The top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.
“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”
The game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.</span>

On top of that, we were allowed to send some questions to the game’s producer Shuhei Matsumoto. Matsumoto is in charge of Capcom Fighting Collection, but he’s also involved with the Street Fighter franchise and more, so it’s fun to get some insight on the title from one of the minds behind this collection as well as other Capcom titles.

                              <span>It feels as if Sony is taking a victory lap in the wake of the success of its various exclusive franchises. The Uncharted movie garnered a strong opening weekend, The Last of Us is getting a highly-anticipated HBO adaptation, and a Jak and Daxter film is in the works. Now the God of War (live-action), Horizon, and Gran Turismo television shows are in development.

VGC reports that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra confirmed the creation of the three shows during a recent business briefing. Amazon has the streaming rights to God of War while Horizon is slated for a Netflix release. However, no streaming service is connected to Gran Turismo (see Benji-Sales’ tweet above). There’s no launch date set for any of the shows seeing as how development was just announced.
In other video game adaptation news, the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 movie dropped earlier this week on Paramount Plus. Be sure to read Brian Shea’s review of the film. And when you’re done with that, head here to find out where to stream the best video game movies.

                              <span>We still don’t know when PlayStation VR2 will hit stores, but when it does, it will have over 20 games available on day one, according to Sony. 
Video Games Chronicle reports that Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan told investors during a briefing call that,
“Right now, there is a considerable amount of money being spent on partnerships with independent and other third-party developers to secure a considerable pipeline of attractive VR content at the launch of PlayStation VR2.”
He continued by saying, “That energy, that effort, and that money will continue to grow as the installed base of PlayStation VR2 headsets grows also.”
A slide image from the presentation (posted below) states these games consist of both first-party and third-party games. The only PS VR2 title announced so far is Horizon: Call of the Mountain, a first-person experience in development at Firesprite and Guerrilla Games. 
Sony formally unveiled PS VR2 in January during CES. The headset’s features include enhanced screen resolution and head tracking, a single cord for easier set-up, and more ergonomically designed controllers featuring haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

                              <span>Big things are once again happening in Fortnite. On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called &quot;Collision.&quot; This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.
The events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.
Epic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won&#x27;t be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.
If you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.
If you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you&#x27;ll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You&#x27;ll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.
What do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?</span>

                              <span>The first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi release tomorrow on Disney+. I can&#x27;t wait to see Ewan McGregor reprise the role of Obi-Wan and hope Hayden Christensen gets the chance to be the version of Darth Vader that brings fear to the Jedi ranks. I&#x27;m also eager to see the Inquisitors in a live-action format. Rupert Friend is suiting up as the Grand Inquisitor, Sung Kang is The Fifth Brother, and Moses Ingram is The Third Sister, who we also know is named Reva Sevander. Reva is everywhere in the early merchandising announcements, perhaps implying she is one of Obi-Wan&#x27;s significant threats.
Hasbro is also placing Reva front and center in three different action figure series. Yesterday, the toy manufacturer showed images of Reva as a Black Series, Vintage, and Retro action figure. She comes with her unique double-bladed lightsaber in all variations, which can split in two. More information about these figures will be made available this weekend during the Star Wars Celebration. For now, you can see the announcement video and images below:</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that the PlayStation 5 is frustratingly elusive for millions of Sony fans around the globe. In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn&#x27;t the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. 
In the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won&#x27;t be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. 
Matt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:
&quot;The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it&#x27;s also overpowering, and the design won&#x27;t please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what&#x27;s important to you, most especially your leisure time.&quot;
Hopefully, we&#x27;ll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.

                              <span>It&#x27;s shaping up to be a great weekend for people who like getting lost in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars Celebration kicks off tomorrow in Anaheim, Calif, and the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi hit Disney&#x27;s streaming service a day later. Obi-Wan will also join the fight in Fortnite tomorrow night. And we should really start celebrating Star Wars right now, as today is the anniversary of A New Hope&#x27;s theatrical release.
If past Star Wars Celebrations are any example to follow, we&#x27;ll see plenty of collectibles announcements over the weekend. Some toy manufacturers are getting out in front of the potential bombardment of news. Funko just announced the first wave of Pops based on the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll see more in the days to come.
This line offers a new version of Obi-Wan, looking slightly older than he did in Revenge of the Sith. We&#x27;re also getting a menacing sculpt of Darth Vader, who looks exactly like you would expect. The only new character is Reva, the Third Sister, looking ready to ignite her lightsaber. A deluxe version of Obi-Wan riding an Eopie is also on the way. All of these figures are expected to hit retailers in October. You can see them below:</span>

                              <span>Earlier this week AWS announced general availability on their new Arm Neoverse-V1 based processors, Graviton3. Right after that I posted some initial Graviton3 benchmarks against prior-generation Graviton2 for showing the very sizable generational improvement with Amazon&#x27;s new in-house Arm server processors. Since then I have been carrying out a more robust set of around 100 benchmarks across the original Graviton instance, Graviton2, Graviton3, and then up again Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC competing instances. Here is that much larger collection of Graviton3 performance benchmarks carried out on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.</span>

Bloober Team almost ended up tackling a very different horror franchise than Blair Witch. In a new interview, Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno says the studio was offered the chance to take on several horror IPs including Saw, but passed on them for Blair Witch.
Speaking to IGN during the Digital Dragons games conference in Poland, Babieno described how the Blair Witch deal came to be. Bloober was in talks with multiple major movie studios, but passed on offers. Then came Lionsgate.
Lionsgate expressed admiration for Layers of Fear and Observer. The studio offered a list of horror IPs and, according to Babieno, offered Bloober its choice of one.
&quot;We could [have chosen] Saw, which is more popular than Blair Witch, but we decided to take Blair Witch because the universe has many opportunities to build something new,&quot; said Babieno. &quot;That was the reason why we chose this project.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RhaDPDf-xsM
He goes on to say that being offered these licenses wasn&#x27;t a one-off, and the studio has received more offers since Blair Witch. Bloober Team turned them down though, due to other projects in the pipeline.
&quot;Unfortunately, for almost one year, we have [had to say] &#x27;pass&#x27; to almost everything, because we don&#x27;t have capacity to do any more titles at one time,&quot; said Babieno.
Time to play a game
It&#x27;s an interesting game of what-if to play, imagining Bloober&#x27;s version of a Saw video game. The team went on to tackle Blair Witch instead though, and has seemingly kept busy since.
Currently, Bloober is working with Konami, though the product of that partnership hasn&#x27;t been announced. That hasn&#x27;t stopped the studio from being the subject of Silent Hill speculation, though.
The team is also working on another project with Take-Two publishing arm Private Division, and another that Babieno teases is in pre-production.

I generally approach matters of shooting digital Nazis in the face with avid gusto. However, fate conspired to delay my spree through Sniper Elite 5. A storm ripped through my neighborhood and thoroughly savaged the power grid. The electricity is still down, and I’m writing from a hidden bunker in a remote location. Be thankful, Fritz. You’ve been spared a few more days to tighten your helmet strap.
In the meantime, I can give you the rundown of what I have played in the dim light of my underground lair. I doubt any of it will be very surprising.

Anyone who&#x27;s ever had a beloved old gaming console die on them knows the heartbreak that comes along with it. A trusty little device that has gotten you through long nights and tough times is suddenly no more, and having to let go of a console that has a lot of memories attached to it can definitely sting. While most of us are likely to take our dead device to an e-waste center and move onto the next one, some gamers out there seem to be a bit more sentimental — and technically skilled in dismantling old hardware.
In a post on the r/gaming Subreddit, user Wolve5000 showed off their memorialized Nintendo DS Lite, and it has to be one of the most beautiful ways I&#x27;ve ever seen someone recycle an old console. Essentially they dismantled the …</span>

Electronic Arts has finally launched its long-awaited Custom Pronoun update for its popular sandbox lifestyle simulator The Sims 4. The new update, available now on PC and console platforms, offers a selection of pronouns that players can now afford their community of in-game Sims.
When creating a new Sim, players can now select a new option labeled &quot;Hello, my name and pronouns are…&quot; in order to name their character and their respective pronouns. Players can currently choose from &quot;He/Him,&quot; &quot;She/Her,&quot; &quot;They/Them,&quot; or &quot;Custom,&quot; which allows full control over Subjective, Objective, Possessive Dependent, Possessive Independent, and Reflexive forms of the character&#x27;s pronouns.

The developer notes that the update is currently only available in English, a…</span>

Sony is trying to get PlayStation fans in the spending mood again with its annual PlayStation Days of Play sale. The promo will run for two weeks — it&#x27;s here through Wednesday, June 8 — and features hundreds of PS4 and PS5 game deals on the PlayStation Store, as well as discounted DualSense controllers, if you need to stock up.
Considering I just bought a Starlight Blue controller a few weeks ago, I&#x27;m a little bummed! But that&#x27;s how it goes. If you&#x27;re looking to pick up a secondary PS5 gamepad, the original White, Cosmic Red, Galactic Purple, Midnight Black, Nova Pink, and Starlight Blue controllers are down to $59 on Amazon right now. Normally, they&#x27;re $70-$75 a pop.

                              <span>Horsepower coming to consoles
It&#x27;s taken almost five long years, but indie outfit Mane6 has announced that its equestrian hoof-&#x27;em-up is kickin&#x27; the dirt, snortin&#x27; steam, and getting ready to let rip on console platforms — Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds will finally come galloping onto PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms this fall.
Originally released for Steam Early Access way back in 2018, before receiving its full PC release in the spring of 2020, Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds is a hyper-stylized 2D fighter that sees some very silly mares duking it out in some hard hoofin&#x27; one-on-one action. From crazy-eyed alpacas and magical unicorns, to yee-hawing ponies and even a grumpy lil&#x27; goat, TFH combines cartoon quality art and animation with solid, old-school mechanics for a unique fighting game experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;92rTB2wyPPo
Originally conceived as a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fan game, developer Mane6 quickly readjusted its design plans when Hasbro lawyers came a&#x27;callin. This proved to be the best thing that could happen for the project, however, and with fresh designs from Friendship is Magic creator Lauren Faust at hand, the Mane6 team embarked on its own original scrapper. A true passion project, Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds has seen more intensive and passionate developer support than many fighters 50 times its size and popularity.
The console edition of Them&#x27;s Fightin&#x27; Herds will launch for $19.99. A Deluxe Edition, available for $39.99, includes a season pass for four new upcoming characters, as well as new stages and other cosmetics. You can check out all of the details by moseying on over to the Maximum Games Store.

                              <span>I want to try it on the next run
A new Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail is coming at &#x27;ya compliments of YouTuber Bigotilyou, who uncovered yet another thing I haven&#x27;t seen before.
The discovery deals with the final memory: a questline in Zelda that involves Link running around Hyrule to learn more about the past. As the below video on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild detail points out, there are actually two ways the final memory can play out:
One involves Link finding the memory as normal (this is the path most players will take).
The other includes a subtle extra bit of footage, provided that players actually take a photo of the picture on the wall in Impa&#x27;s abode.
The short video showcases all of the differences, starting with the &quot;alternate&quot; cut, then showing the way 99% of the playerbase likely saw it: followed by a supercut of both endings in one, with the former lasting a tad longer in length.
Like many Zelda: Breath of the Wild discoveries, a lot of people are probably like &quot;so, what?&quot; But the fact that so many of these sorts of things exist is a testament to its enduring legacy. Folks are still uncovering little tricks of the trade, and in an era where nearly everything is spoiled online in a week and everything is forgotten quickly, that&#x27;s a feat.
While some are tired of the Breath of the Wild discourse, for once, I&#x27;m glad that a game can live on beyond the initial zeitgeist explosion.

                              <span>The developer cites the impact of the war in Ukraine
Replaced made quite an impact last year during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 press conference. Originally, developer Sad Cat Studios was aiming for a 2022 launch. But today, the studio announced Replaced has been delayed to 2023.
Sad Cat Studios is based out of Belarus, with a team of developers from Belarus and Ukraine. In today&#x27;s statement, the team cites the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying it has heavily impacted the development of Replaced, as most of the team resides in neighboring regions.
&quot;The priority for Sad Cat was for the safety of the team and their families,&quot; reads today&#x27;s statement. &quot;As a result, part of the team has now relocated and work has only recently restarted on Replaced.&quot;
Due to this, the publisher Coatsink, Thunderful, and developer all decided to move the release window to 2023. The team is continuing to work on Replaced, but says it is prioritizing the physical and mental health of its developers by not forcing the original deadline.

Enter the void
Replaced does look pretty rad, with some incredible pixel art and style to it. But the decision to take a little more time for the studios&#x27; well-being is a good one, and a little extra time is a pittance compared to making sure the team at Sad Cat Studios is doing okay.
The war in Ukraine has had an effect on many of the game studios in the region. In response to the situation, many publishers and developers called for aid, to help those affected by the invasion. Recently, Epic and Microsoft teamed up to donate Fortnite proceeds towards various charities, ultimately raising $144 million in support.
Other companies have also responded by removing their games from sale. CD Projekt halted sales in Russia and Belarus, and Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from several of its sports games.

Temtem is out in September, according to publisher Humble Games, and it&#x27;ll arrive on the PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms. A collector&#x27;s edition has also been announced, and will feature a statue of the three starters, a card set, pins, patches, and a collector&#x27;s box.
If you&#x27;ve never played or heard of it before Jordan has a great writeup here, but suffice to say it&#x27;s essentially a different take on the Pokemon formula. You play the role of a tamer [trainer], and attempt to catch creatures and battle them. The studio calls it a &quot;massive multiplayer creature-collection adventure.&quot;

Billed as the &quot;1.0&quot; edition following a lengthy early access period, the story campaign involves &quot;six vivid islands,&quot; with a narrative involving the &quot;evil Clan Belsoto.&quot; Of course, there&#x27;s chilling involved too, with activities like fishing and hanging around the open world. Unlike Pokemon, the team has embraced online play, and allows you to &quot;see other tamers around&quot; on the map and fight in co-op form. Player housing is in too, as well as outfit customization and competitive elements (which involves a round of bans and picks until you square off in a 5v5 format).
New stuff that&#x27;s coming to Temtem 1.0 includes seasonal updates and a battle pass system, with free and premium tracks. There&#x27;s also a &quot;final endgame island,&quot; which has new vendors, places to explore, and more battle opportunities. Quests will be updated &quot;weekly and regularly.&quot;
With the level of success this game has reached before 1.0, it stands to reason that it&#x27;ll be supported for some time after Temtem is out in September.

As we approach the first anniversary of gorgeous fighter Guilty Gear Strive, (yes, already), developer Arc System Works has announced that it will be dropping a major update at the start of next month, bringing with it a full roster rebalance, gameplay and mechanic tweaks, and a further optimized control system.
While no further details were announced in relation to this update, it appears much more than your common-or-garden everyday batch of buffs and nerfs. It appears that the patch will actually reapproach the core elements of Guilty Gear Strive&#x27;s combat, which is perhaps an effort to quell some of the complaints that have come around (mainly from the ultra-hardcore community) regarding Strive&#x27;s heavy-hitting, streamlined gameplay — a design decision that…</span>

                              <span>They&#x27;re out on May 31 with the new update
Developer miHoYo just put out a new Genshin Impact Yelan trailer, which shows off the core new five-star character that&#x27;s set to debut in update 2.7.
As usual, it looks like the studio has knocked it out of the park, as Yelan is essentially coming out of nowhere and making an...impact. As a five-star hydro archer, she&#x27;ll join Kuki Shinobu (a four-star electro support) as the main gang of update 2.7. A &quot;drumalong rhythm game,&quot; a new Archon Quest taking place in the Chasm, and Xiao/Arataki Itto banner re-runs are on the menu come May 31, too.
What I love about Genshin is how much variety there is when it comes to the cast. Anything is possible, from criminal underlords to magical girls, to stalwart shonen types. And somehow, the team manages to craft characters with a heavy mix of personality and unique gameplay abilities — but when those characters are tied to gacha elements, making them as enticing as possible is part of the craft.
Get a load of Yelan below, and a full rundown of her moveset here.
Here&#x27;s the cinematic Genshin Impact Yelan character teaser to get some insight into their personality:

                              <span>A surprise patch has dropped for the PC version of the action RPG that many missed out on last year, Ys IX: Monstrum Nox, which makes now would be a perfect time to get acquainted with the series.
While working on the upcoming localization of Trails From Zero (another Falcom game you should keep your eyes on), PH3 developer Peter &quot;Durante&quot; Thoman discovered how to increase CPU performance in that game. After finding promising results in Trails From Zero, he brought the technique over to Ys IX. Lo and behold, there was an impressive frame rate boost with the same implementation, with a 25% increase in parts of the game where the CPU can bottleneck performance. The update proved stable enough in testing to push it live for everyone playing the Steam version.

                              <span>Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds is the sixth entry in Level-5’s beloved JRPG series. The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. 


Like the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: 
“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” 
For all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. 
Kim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:
“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”


Hopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.</span>

                              <span>After finding success on PC, 2D fighter Them’s Fightin’ Herds is making its way to consoles this fall.
If the game reminds you of My Little Pony, it should. Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic&#x27;s launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. 


Them’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. 
The console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. 
Them’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.</span>

                              <span>End Global 7, a co-op company composed of prominent development studios like DC Universe Online dev Daybreak Game Company, revealed last November that it had a new Marvel MMORPG in early development. Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. 
This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. 
“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”
EG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” 
It sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future. For more, read about the graphics upgrade and massive expansion coming to DC Universe Online in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Hello Games just released the Outlaws update for No Man’s Sky back in April alongside news that its next project won’t be a sequel to the sci-fi title, and now, the studio has revealed that it’s launching another expedition…today!
Dubbed “Leviathan,” this expedition is the result of a community in-joke that No Man’s Sky is missing space whales because space whales is exactly what Leviathan brings to the game. However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. 


“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.
“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”

The story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet.

                              <span>coverage here.

Diablo Immortal is just around the corner. After its big release date announcement last month, we released an installment of New Gameplay Today all about the game, how it plays on both mobile devices and PC, and more. Today, we&#x27;re back with even more new Diablo Immortal footage and another developer interview. This time, we&#x27;ve got principal game designer Joe Grubb and senior game designer Scott Burgess joining your host John Carson to talk about the lore implications of Diablo Immortal, some of the big bads, returning characters, class changes, and even the game&#x27;s audio design. 


Diablo Immortal hits Android and iOS devices, as well as PC, on June 2 so hopefully, if you&#x27;re excited about the first-ever Diablo game made from-the-ground-up for mobile, this tides you over until then.
For more about Diablo Immortal, be sure to head to the official Game Informer Diablo Immortal hub, which contains first looks at the game, news stories, and more. For more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for early looks at Fueled Up, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, MultiVersus, Bear And Breakfast, and more.</span>

                              <span>Temtem is a popular online multiplayer monster-catching game that’s a lot like Pokémon and it’s been in early access for years. However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. 


That includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. 
“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”
However, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here. For more, read about Temtem’s PS5 arrival back in December of 2020, and then check out this installment of New Gameplay Today all about Temtem.

If a movie below isn&#x27;t available to view as part of a subscription, such as Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Disney+, etc., it&#x27;s most likely available to rent or buy digitally from companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Vudu, and more. 
The following list was created on May 5, 2022, and the availability of these movies may have changed.

What if there was a way to stop the aging process and only your family knew the secret? How far would you go to protect it? And at what cost? The Centennial Case isn’t your typical murder-mystery adventure game. It goes out of its way to be different, whether it’s swapping you to various murders over the course of 100 years or using live-action footage to make you feel like you’re participating in a movie.

                              <span>Offline servers are finally arriving for vampiric Steam sensation V Rising as part of a hotfix today. Developers Stunlock announced the changes on the V Rising Discord and Twitter this morning. It looks fairly straightforward to enable the new mode so I’ll run through that for you.

                              <span>Karl Fairburne, the titular Sniper Elite, is a pro at pinging baddies in the distance. The master of shooting Nazis in the balls across hundreds of metres. It’s a mystery, then, why the French Resistance constantly hand him objectives that require close-quarters combat. “Sneak into this chateau,” or “blow up that radar,” they say, probably with a smirk assuming that he won’t be able to pull it off. He can, of course, but it’s a monotonous series of missions that rarely asks you to get inventive with your trusty rifle.

It’s no lightweight implementation either, combining both ray traced reflections and sun shadows that can really spruce up the game’s already-gleaming murder sandboxes. It’ll please shiny floor enthusiast Katharine, put it that way.

Homebody will channel the slasher film aesthetic of the 1980s, a stark tonal shift from the hand-drawn cheesecake colourfulness of Game Grumps and Rogue Games&#x27; first collaboration, Dream Daddy. Some of the same team are back for this one though. Watch the eerie trailer below.

The remake of Infinity Ward&#x27;s famous (and infamous?) first-person shooter will release on October 28th, and Activision Blizzard decided to reveal some of its character art via the medium of a real world cargo ship.

                              <span>There are a handful of rhythm games on PC, but a lot of them are ultra-hard, anime-drenched tests of reflexes and memorisation. I like my rhythm games on the other end of the scale, containing playful minigames with silly concepts and stories. Think Rhythm Heaven. Think Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan.

Think, perhaps, Melatonin. It&#x27;s an in-development rhythm game about dreams merging with reality, and looks like exactly my thing. Watch the trailer below.

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce for testing the game Chewy: ESC From F5. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks.. escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
So if any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. Please note that the ScummVM version does have one obvious limitation, though.. the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work.

But then, just look at Temtem. It&#x27;s not exactly hiding its inspirations. Temtem is undoubtedly like Pokémon, but set in a world populated by other players. After a couple of years in early access, the developers announced today that they&#x27;re aiming for to hit 1.0 this September.

It&#x27;s fully 3D space-ish combat, this time with colourful stylised levels, somewhere between technicolour neon and oddly minimalist. I don&#x27;t want to start on a downer so let&#x27;s say that my opinion of it improved the more I played it.

                              <span>Vampiric survival sandbox V Rising has, according to Steam’s player counts, entranced itself quite a following. That includes RPS’ own Ed, whose otherwise glowing preview mentioned some performance issues on Nvidia GPUs. 


I’m duty-bound to investigate any potential hardware hitches, though since V Rising is only in early access, this isn’t going to be the usual appraisal of how it performs on various PC hardware. That can wait until it’s had more of the spit ‘n’ polish treatment that typically comes with the status of actually being finished. That said, I have done a full sweep of V Rising’s graphics settings and their performance impact, so if your FPS count is melting like a Nosferatu on an ill-considered Corfu holiday, have a look below to see if you can make some fruitful tweaks.

That’s the basis of Polish author Jacek Piekara’s series of novels, now set to become third-person action adventure I, The Inquisitor, from developers The Dust. Somebody probably ought to consult the Archbishop of Canterbury for the PEGI rating, like. Watch the trailer below.

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king&#x27;s abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.

This time around your Hunter, Warlock or Titan will get to become an ‘eater of fear’. Sounds tasty? “Where once we banished the nightmares,” the trailer says, “a new terror rouses them from their slumber.” Watch the video below and try not to check over your shoulder.

                              <span>Happy Volcano&#x27;s raucous comedy driving game You Suck At Parking has come a long way since we last saw it in the autumn of 2020. When Imogen (RPS in peace) last sucked at stopping her colourful cartoon car in its devilishly placed parking spots, she did so alone in an alpha demo for its single player campaign mode. Last week, however, James, Liam and myself went hands on with an exclusive build of its new 8-strong multiplayer mode, accompanied by five members of Happy Volcano&#x27;s development team to test it out - and let me tell you, if the battle modes of recent Mario Karts have left you feeling increasingly cold over the years, this is looking to be just the thing to grease those competitive wheels again.

Keighley made the comments in a Twitter Spaces cast over the weekend, probably to everyone&#x27;s great relief. Of course, he immediately followed up by explaining that the publishers with fewer games to show will be rolling their presentations into Keighley’s own Summer Game Fest, as well as first-party shows such as the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase.

Three members of the Game Workers Alliance (GWA) group voted against, while 19 voted in favour. The vote means legal recognition for the group at the Call Of Duty: Warzone developers, which first organised in January in response to layoffs at the end of last year.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7000 family of CPUs is preparing for launch in 2022, two years after the Ryzen 5000 series. AMD have spent a good chunk of that time on its laptop chips, but back in the realm of desktops, Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake chips have leveraged major design improvements to beat the Ryzen 5000 series on performance and features. One suspects it would take a considerable rejigging for these Ryzen 7000 chips to get back into the best gaming CPUs conversation – and so far, that’s exactly what seems to be happening. 


Now, AMD haven’t revealed all things Ryzen 7000 yet. There are no confirmed prices, for one, though we know roughly when the first batch of CPUs will release. For now, this is where I’ll be gathering all the reliably verified info on these next-gen components, from supported features and the new motherboard chipsets to those overhauled Ryzen 7000 specs.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy releases this holiday for multiple platforms, but PlayStation 5 players will experience additional technical magic thanks to the game’s suite of DualSense features.
A PlayStation Blog post revealed the different ways Hogwarts Legacy takes advantage of the controller’s haptic feedback. For starters, spells sport individual physical button resistances and feedback to make them feel unique from one another. In a nice touch, these haptic effects are isolated to the right side of the controller to simulate wielding a wand in one hand more accurately. Hopefully, this feature can be flipped to the other side of the gamepad so that left-handed players can experience the same immersion. 


The DualSense light bar displays various flash effects for each spell, but it also radiates the color of your chosen house. For the uninitiated, that’s red for Gryffindor, green for Slytherin, yellow for Hufflepuff, and blue for Ravenclaw. 
The controller will also simulate sensations such as crushing botany ingredients in potions class, deflecting and disintegrating incoming magic using the shield spell Portico, and soaring the skies atop a broom or hippogriff. Hogwarts Legacy also leverages the PS5’s 3D audio to pick up smaller sound effects such as a crackling fireplace and other environmental sound cues.  
To learn more and watch additional video clips of these features in action, be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog post. Hogwarts Legacy doesn’t have a release date, but it’s slated to arrive sometime this holiday. You can play it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can watch an extended gameplay demonstration in March’s State of Play video here.</span>

A few weeks after the confirmation of its existence, Activision Blizzard announced the release date of the next Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, in a tweet accompanied by a video showing off character art from the game.
#ModernWarfare2 Ships October 28th 💀 pic.twitter.com/OsgOspGh1j
May 24, 2022
The tweet reads, “#ModernWarfare2 ships October 28.” Get it? Ships...? The video in the tweet features a cargo ship? You’ll love the joke if you watch the clip. In the said video, there’s a reveal of many familiar faces from Task Force 141 showing up in Modern Warfare II. As the drone footage zips through the Port of Long Beach, the camera focuses on the sides of shipping containers displaying the portraits of Captain John Price, Simon “Ghost” Riley, John “Soap” MacTavish, Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, and, according to the YouTube description for the video, the introduction of Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas.
For a better look at the cast of Modern Warfare II, check out the gallery below.

While we now know Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II “ships” on October 28, we don’t know much of anything about the setting, story, and multiplayer, and still don’t have any known platforms for its release. PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC are a shoo-in, but PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are likely, but questionable additions as we move forward in the console generation.</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has secured its release date along with a new cinematic trailer. 
Gollum’s video game solo outing launches September 1 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Switch version will arrive sometime later in the year.


The game was first announced in 2019 and was originally slated to arrive in 2021 before being delayed into this year. The story follows J.R.R. Tolkein’s books rather than Peter Jackson’s film trilogy, detailing Gollum’s happenings during the first chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring after he loses the One Ring to Bilbo Baggins. Gollum embarks on a journey across Middle-earth, visiting locations such as Mirkwood and Barad-dûr. 
Gameplay-wise, Gollum is a stealth adventure game as players sneak around environments and can choose to avoid or engage enemies. The choice depends on if you indulge Gollum’s vicious nature or the more timid tendencies of his other personality, Smeagol. Climbing and platforming are also a big part of the experience as players can scale structures, adding verticality to exploration. 
We last saw The Lord of the Rings: Gollum in action in 2021 during a hands-off preview demo. You can read our impressions of it from that time here.</span>

Last week, we posted a rundown of the set and its mechanics, so check out that story to get the lowdown on the new and returning mechanics.
Wizards of the Coast has graciously allowed us to preview one of the cards coming with this set, and this creature may want all of the big-brain plays you can muster. Take a look at Intellect Devourer.

                              <span>When Sonic the Hedgehog 2 launched on Sega Genesis in 1992, it took the foundation laid with the Blue Blur&#x27;s debut entry and expanded it in myriad ways. In the 16-bit sequel, Sonic had new moves and a two-tailed fox friend to aid him, but with those upgrades came more significant threats from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Genesis was immediately regarded as a definite upgrade over the already strong first entry in the series. Similarly, Paramount&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.

                              <span>Marvel Studios has released a new Thor: Love and Thunder trailer that runs more than two minutes long and features a ton of new footage, especially compared to the teaser trailer released last month. 
The new trailer features extended looks at scenes from the teaser, like when Thor realizes Jane Foster is back and now wielding Mjolnir. It also contains new footage of Korg, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the villain of Taika Waititi’s latest Thor film, Gorr the God Butcher.


For comic fans, one look at Christian Bale’s Gorr, and it’s immediately apparent that this is a very different take. Gorr is typically more alien-looking but still humanoid. Bale’s Gorr looks very much like a human, and it’s not surprising because if you’re going to hire someone like Bale to play a villain, why not squeeze out as much as you can by reminding folks that this is Bale. 
However, regardless of where you fall on “he’s too human” or “I like it,” it’s hard to disagree that Bale’s Gorr is appropriately metal. Right off the bat, Gorr the God Butcher is an incredible title to hold if you’re a villain. Couple that with his first announcement – that all gods need to die, including Thor – and his design, which features black-tipped fingers, a planet-shattering weapon, and a black liquid that runs out of his mouth, and Gorr might be the most metal MCU villain yet. 

For more, watch the first Thor: Love and Thunder teaser trailer and then listen to this episode of From Panel To Podcast, which is Game Informer’s comic book podcast, to hear us talk about Thor: Love and Thunder.

                              <span>Take-Two, the publisher behind household name franchises like Grand Theft Auto, XCOM, and NBA2K, has officially acquired mobile juggernaut Zynga in the second-biggest deal in games history after Microsoft&#x27;s eventual acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
According to PC Gamer, the proposals were approved last Thursday, and the acquisition totals a whopping $12.7 billion. Zynga is notable for its globally enjoyed small screen titles like Farmville and CSR Racing 2, the most popular mobile racing game. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick voiced his company&#x27;s excitement about the deal, stating:
&quot;We are thrilled to complete our combination with Zynga, which is a pivotal step to increase exponentially our Net Bookings from mobile, the fastest-growing segment in interactive entertainment, while also providing us with substantial cost synergies and revenue opportunities. As we bring together our exceptional talent, exciting pipelines of games, and industry-leading technologies and capabilities, we believe that we can take our portfolio to another level of creativity, innovation, and quality.&quot;
Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau responded in kind, &quot;We are excited for Zynga&#x27;s next-generation mobile platform, free-to-play expertise, diverse offering of games and incredible team to join the Take-Two family. We are eager to continue building an unparalleled portfolio of games that will reach broader markets and lead to continued growth for this next chapter of Zynga&#x27;s history.&quot;
Perhaps we&#x27;ll see more mobile ports or versions of Take-Two titles in the coming years. This deal comes hot off of financial reports that revealed the launch of more than 69 Take-Two games over the next three years. Only time will tell what fruit is born of this monumental merger. Acquisition culture is growing in the games industry. Sony recently hired a Corporate Development Director to spearhead growth opportunities through acquisitions, and Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer reiterated Xbox&#x27;s commitment to buying studios that are &quot;a good fit.&quot;

                              <span>Gloomhaven is a dungeon-crawling board game that required a little muscle from the player, as its massive box weighs over 20 pounds. That heft is the conversation starter that helped Gloomhaven find the audience it rightfully deserves. It&#x27;s a great board game experience that was recently adapted into an equally as notable turn-based tactical RPG for PC. And now developer Flaming Fowl Studios and publisher Asmodee Digital have plans to release this digital version on consoles in 2023.
Asmodee is working with Saber Games and Embracer Group on this console port. No specific systems are known at this time, but Asmodee&#x27;s tweet announcing this project shows an image of an Xbox controller. You can see it below along with a teaser video for the console versions:

It’s said that even the best-laid plans often go awry, and that is fully evident in Mini Motorways. What starts as a pleasant city-planning simulation evolves into a frantic puzzle you must solve before time runs out. The stress of having your carefully planned city infrastructure crumble before your eyes is undeniable. However, it’s in that often-sudden transition from meditative to manic where Mini Motorways shines, offering players a unique take on both the puzzle and city-planning simulation ge…</span>

                              <span>Je rok 1924 a 33letý Man Ray fotografuje svoji přítelkyni, francouzskou modelku a zpěvačku Kiki de Montparnasse. Snímek vyvolá, zvětší, přidělá houslová efa, vše znovu vyfotí a pořídí první zvětšeninu, přičemž signuje tužkou svým jménem a letopočtem 1924. První komerční digitální fotoaparáty přijdou na trhu tři čtvrtě století poté, ona vlastně ani první kinofilmová Leica ještě není na světě, Kodak sotva představil světu první barevný film a uběhly pouhé tři roky od chvíle, kdy se Švédská královská akademie rozhodla udělit nobelovku Albertu Einsteinovi primárně za fotoeletrický jev, protože teorie relativity byla stále příliš bombastickou novátorskou myšlenkou, jakkoli experimentálně ověřenou právě za pomoci expedic s velkoformátovými fotoaparáty.</span>

The Game Workers Alliance, a union of Raven Software quality assurance employees, has successfully voted to become officially recognized by Activision Blizzard. That makes them only the second formal union in the North American video game industry, following Video Games unionizing in December 2021, and the first within a major U.S. game publisher. 
According to the Washington Post, the Milwaukee branch of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) counted mailed-in ballots submitted by eligible Raven employees. Out of 22 ballots, 19 voted Yes, and 3 voted No. Parties have until May 31 to file an objection. If no one does, then the result becomes official. 
This story began last December in the wake of the ongoing Activision Blizzard sexual misconduct scandal. The publisher u…</span>

                              <span>I was just telling a friend that I would love to see a Lobo television show that draws inspiration from The Mandalorian and Deadpool. Picture an intergalactic bounty hunter with an attitude problem – that&#x27;s basically Lobo. He first appeared in an Omega Men comic book in 1983, and after bouncing through dozens of DC comic book series for decades, finally made his live-action debut in an episode of Krypton. The point being: We need more Lobo.
He&#x27;s a wild character who almost starred in his own video game in 1996. Ocean of America was hard at work on a fighting game starring Lobo for Super Nintendo and Genesis. As the fact sheets below show, the developer apparently had most of the gameplay details worked out. The canceled project included moves like &quot;Ram Grenade Down Throat,&quot; &quot;Blow Opponent in Half,&quot; and &quot;Fire Hole Through Opponent.&quot; The setup is what you would expect: Lobo must kill everyone who stands in his way. He even has to murder a clone of himself. Below are a number of fact sheets from Game Informer&#x27;s archives that outline the project, and a gameplay video from a prototype.
I doubt we&#x27;ll ever see Lobo in a game, but there&#x27;s a chance more DC characters like Wonder Woman will get their own projects. Which DC hero do you think deserves a shot at a game next? Let us know in the comments section below.</span>

Here are Game Informer, we loved Sonic The Hedgehog 2, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 and while 2022 is void of much competition in the video game adaptation space, save for Uncharted, it’s one of our favorite video game movies in a while. Sonic fans clearly showed up, too, because not only did Sonic The Hedgehog 2 score the best opening weekend for any video game movie ever, but it’s also the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the U.S. as well. 
In the meantime, check out this story about the scrapped “Ugly Sonic” movie design that makes a cameo in Disney Plus’ new Chip ‘n Dale movie.

                              <span>Fighting game fans and brawler fans rejoice! The mashup you’ve pictured in your head a hundred times – Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – is becoming an action figure reality. That’s because Playmates Toys is releasing four SF vs TMNT character sets and two are coming later this year. 
The four sets respectively are:
Ryu vs. Leonardo – the leaders face off
Chun-Li vs. Michelangelo – authority vs. exuberance
Guile vs Raphael – strength vs. strength
Ken Masters vs. Donatello – restraint vs. intellect

The two releasing this fall are Ryu vs. Leonardo and Chun-Li vs Michelangelo, and it is then that they’ll hit retail shelves. Unfortunately, as you can see above, those are the only two sets with images so far. As for where, Playmates Toys doesn’t say in today’s news, but it’s likely they’ll end up where Playmates Toys figures are typically sold near you. 
“Each figure in the collection stands six inches tall and is highly poseable with multiple points of articulation – from ball joints at the head, shoulders and hips, to split joint elbows and knees, and at the wrist, ankles, upper arms, and thighs,” a press release reads. “Authentically detailed and decorated as seen in the Street Fighter II video game, Street Fighter vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is packed out in an ‘80s video game console-shaped window box packaging.”

                              <span>Hot Wheels Unleashed is getting some content soon featuring some looney new vehicles and tracks. In a new partnership with Warner Bros., Looney Tunes are coming to the high-octane toy racer in July.
A brief teaser trailer shows off the ACME warehouse, and as the camera pans down, we hear the telltale sounds of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote before they&#x27;re seen giving chase in car form on a Hot Wheels track. The Looney Tunes Expansion contains five new Tune-flavored cars, a themed track builder module, themed profile and basement customization items, along with the Looney Tunes Adventure Park environment to cruise around. The Adventure Park features four environments with different themes, one of which being a desert area to recreate Roadrunner and Wile E. chases of your own.
Hot Wheels released a set of six physical Looney Tunes cars in 2017, with the two vehicles shown in the trailer among the group. The others not announced from that set include Bugs Bunny, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, and Daffy Duck. If I were a betting man, I&#x27;d assume the other three cars will come from these remaining four collectibles as well.
The Looney Tunes Expansion will be available on July 14 and can be purchased as a piecemeal DLC for Hot Wheels Unleashed but is also tied to the upcoming Hot Wheels Pass vol. 3 (available for purchase on June 9), which includes more vehicles, customizations, and Track Builder Modules. For more on Hot Wheels Unleashed, read our review of the racer here, and for more Looney Tunes nonsense, check out our preview and videos of MultiVersus.</span>

When I booted up Citizen Sleeper for the first time, it immediately enthralled me with its premise. Its dystopian transhumanist pitch – surviving as a digitized consciousness of a human body implanted into a robot designed to work for a mega-corporation – is refreshing in the cyberpunk genre of games. Its slick, clean, and unique art style, coupled with its score, a Tycho-esque take on sci-fi beats, told me I was in for a good time, assuming the gameplay would click. And at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to because its early …</span>

                              <span>2D Action RPG Lost Epic is graduating from Steam Early Access and going 1.0 this July. The launch also brings the game to PlayStation platforms, marking the game’s first appearance on consoles. 
Lost Epic first launched in Early Access in June 2021, and it blends Metroidvania-style exploration, Souls-inspired fast-paced combat, and a vibrant anime presentation. Players control a God Slayer on a quest to defeat a pantheon of divine gods threatening humanity. The hack ‘n slash combat encourages thoughtful combo-building and utilization of a parry mechanic to slay Lost Epic’s challenging enemies. God Slayers are fully customizable thanks to a deep skill tree, and you can craft enchantments and other items to bolster your arsenal. You can even tackle the campaign alongside friends in three-player online co-op. Check out the release date trailer below to see Lost Epic in action. 


Before launch, Steam Early Access players can now enjoy a new update, Ver 1.3.0, that adds a new world: the Abyss. This patch adds new bosses and the Eyes of God item used to uncover additional unseen paths leading to the game’s final world. You can watch the video for that below. 


At launch, Lost Epic receives a new world called the Sky Spire. The new area contains a powerful raid boss to tackle alone or alongside allies. Players can wield new weapons such as the Regalia blade, staff, shield, and new weapon enhancement materials. Lastly, characters from developer Team Earth Wars’ previous title, Earth’s Dawn, will become playable.  
You can play the final version of Lost Epic on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on July 28. The developer also plans to raise the game&#x27;s price at launch. The new price isn’t listed, but Lost Epic is $19.99 on Steam (though it’s currently discounted to $14.99 until May 27). That means you’ll want to grab it on PC now if you think the game is up your alley.</span>

                              <span>Executive vice president and head of Marvel Games Jay Ong has revealed in a book that both Xbox and PlayStation were approached about making Marvel video games but only one of the console makers accepted the offer. 
A look around the gaming landscape reveals exactly which one, too: PlayStation, the company with an exclusive Spider-Man franchise, and an upcoming Wolverine game. And over on the Xbox side, you won’t find any new Marvel games developed by an Xbox studio because according to Ong, the company declined Marvel’s offer, opting instead to focus on its own IP, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


The book, Steven L Kent’s The Ultimate History of Video Games Vol 2, houses an excerpt where Ong explains this deal and how it led to Marvel prematurely terminating a contract it had wit…</span>

                              <span>Sony unveiled its new and revamped PlayStation Plus service that combines Plus with PS Now back in March. Then, Sony revealed some of its PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and classic games lineup, including a selection of PS1 games, that would be coming to the service. That list wasn’t exhaustive, though, and now, two more classic games have seemingly leaked, as reported by Eurogamer. 
Funnily enough, it appears to have been PlayStation itself that accidentally leaked the two new classic games – Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey (PS1) and Ridge Racer 2 (PSP) – because fans found both listed on the Malaysian PSN store. At the time of this writing, the Abe’s Odyssey page is still up but the Ridge Racer 2 page takes you to a window that says “Not available for purchase” and nothing else. You can also view the Malaysian PSN’s listing of two previously announced PS1 games coming to PS Plus next month – Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. 
As Eurogamer notes, in the ResetEra post where these (seemingly) accidental leaks were first found by players, you can view multiple screenshots from the Ridge Racer 2 listing. 
Over on Video Games Chronicle, you can view nearly 10 minutes of Abe’s Odyssey in action, including a look at its emulation and how the rewind feature works.  
While PlayStation has yet to officially confirm whether Abe’s Odyssey and Ridge Racer 2 are coming to PS Plus, it seems all but guaranteed. The Malaysian PSN page for Abe&#x27;s Odyssey even shows “PS1 Emulation” in the title. While waiting to see if these two games hit the revamped PS Plus service here in the West, read Game Informer’s breakdown of all the games announced for PS Plus so far and then read about the three different PS Plus tiers to determine which one is the best for you.

                              <span>The Logitech MX Master is an incredibly popular series of office mice, and today the latest MX Master 3 has dropped from its usual price of $100 to just $55 at Office Depot. That&#x27;s a massive discount, achieved via a combination of an Office Depot price drop to $75, a 25% off code (SELFMADETECH) and a 30% back rewards code (90893995). 
This isn&#x27;t the best mouse for gaming, but based on my experiences with the original MX Master and its successors, plenty of PC gamers will use something like this for surfing the web, working and playing single-player games, then switch to something lighter if needed for multiplayer gaming.

                              <span>Every kid is a goddamn dork. Some people - the cool kids of school - think they’ve got it all figured out, while others just mope about in their groups of indie kids, emos, and nerds, to name but a few very atypical retinues. It’s all a lie, though: in reality everyone’s an idiot as a kid, blissfully unaware of adult problems as they struggle through the most painfully awkward years of their lives. 


Floppy Knights revels in that dorkiness. A tactical card-based game that’s been in early access since last June, Rose City Games’ adventure stars Phoebe, an absolutely adorable and excruciatingly optimistic nerd who delights in tackling problems facing her community.

                              <span>The Steam Deck only had a few weeks of getting to know Final Fantasy XIV before the latter’s 6.08 update wrenched them apart. In less undeservedly romantic terms, it was the MMO’s newly added launcher that – unlike the rest of the game – didn’t work well at all with the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. Two months later, however, Valve have released an update on Proton’s experimental branch that fixes the launcher, making FFXIV playable on the handheld PC once again.

Reddit user Sagezu was flummoxed by the bug over the weekend and shared their woe at crashing out of Lost Ark’s first Legion Raid, Valtan, which arrived as part of the May update. Judging by the comments, many other Lost Ark players were encountering the same bug.

                              <span>A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year&#x27;s Google Summer of Code.
We are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.
Pragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh&#x27;s main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.
Michael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.
Emanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.
Avijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet&#x27;s task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.
The team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.
Please give a warm welcome to our new students! Let&#x27;s make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!

                              <span>Battlefield 2042 continues to receive updates as EA Dice attempt to fix a game that felt woefully incomplete at launch. Which makes it a little odd that the marquee change in patch 4.1 is the removal of a feature: Breakthrough mode can no longer be played with 128 players, and is now limited to 64. 

Not that Battlefield 2042&#x27;s website or digital store pages have been updated to reflect that change yet.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve emerged from the depths of the BioShock series to begin a fresh season of Video Gameography! We&#x27;re doing things differently this time as we&#x27;re discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020&#x27;s Hades. 
Unlike Supergiant Games&#x27; previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that&#x27;s developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it&#x27;s being made.

The ‘Destined For Destruction’ update also brings a brand-new Guardian Raid, Deskaluda, which looks like a dragon made out of Victorian iron fencing and ooze-green Dulux. Axe-wielding goat lad Valtan arrives this month to finally incorporate team-based Legion Raids into the Western version of Lost Ark too.

                              <span>We did a lot of cool things during our time at this year&#x27;s PAX East. We attended a wonderful talk by &quot;Skyrim Grandma&quot; Shirley Curry. We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show&#x27;s official trading event.


I’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge.

                              <span>The RX 6800 XT is one of the best AMD graphics cards, outperforming the RTX 3070 in rasterised titles by around 10-15% according to my own testing while costing around the same price. Therefore, after we&#x27;ve covered plenty of discounted Nvidia cards, we ought to let you know that an RX 6800 XT is going cheap on Amazon.com right now.

                              <span>A new collection of indie puzzle games released today aims to give a broad and gentle introduction to many puzzling subgenres. Wrapped up in that idea that they&#x27;re all pulled from a mysterious alien games console, CosmOS 9 packs nine games that are each meant to take 30-90 minutes. I&#x27;ve played a few and they seemed puzzle game staples, having me drawing paths through blocks, figure out how a mysterious computer interface worked, and such. See the breadth of the cosmic puzzling experience in the trailer below.

I&#x27;d launch Windows 3.1 just to watch screensavers, marvelling at Mystify and staring at Starfield. How wonderful that our computer needed to dream as preventative medicine! I relived this today with a new collection of customisable 3D screensavers, watching shoals of fish, taking a road trip through a museum of global electricity pylons, watching housing estates rise and fall, and seeing so many swirly colours.

                              <span>After some of the stuff we talked about in last week&#x27;s episode, I decided to take us further down the giggle chute to talk about funny games in general. What games are funny? Why, and how? Is it easier for games to be funny when they&#x27;re not trying to be? Should self-described funny games be avoided entirely?
Because of this, we end up talking about Blorko again. We also nearly come to war about the difference between randomly improvising funny stuff and deciding that saying &#x27;egg&#x27; a lot of is funny. There is a difference, but you know it when you see it. Matthew&#x27;s life is like a sitcom, and also we apologise to Henry Cavill for forgetting his birthday. Sorry Henry. Please come on the show.

                              <span>Being a father changes you. After years of resolutely hating on Sonic, my son&#x27;s interest in the characters, games and cartoon has softened me up. I will now begrudgingly admit that Sonic Boom is alright, and the first Sonic live action movie is better than expected. 

So here I am, looking at the new footage of Sonic Origins, which collects and remasters the blue hedgehog&#x27;s original platform games.

                              <span>Game Pass is particularly ideal for two kinds of games: indie games you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like enough to commit to the upfront cost, and decent-not-great blockbusters you know almost certainly aren&#x27;t worth the cost but would quite like to play for at least a bit.

There are plenty of games that fit into both of these categories joining the subscription service before the end of May, including Vampire Survivors, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Sniper Elite 5 and Jurassic World Evolution 2.

                              <span>Three or four times a year, someone at Square Enix says that news is coming about Final Fantasy and we all get our hopes up. This is one of those times. Tetsuya Nomura, Final Fantasy VII Remake director, has said that &quot;various&quot; announcements are coming next month related to Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Will it be news about the second part of the FF7 Remake - or will it be, I dunno, a livestreamed concert and some phone wallpapers?

This should make the newly launched Core i9-12900KS, in a way, the realest deal of all: it’s structurally identical to the Core i9-12900K, originally the top-spec CPU in the series, but made with an even more discerning binning process. A component of the highest quality components, if you will, and as such can brush past the Core i9-12900K’s maximum boost clock speed of 5.2GHz to reach a scorching 5.5GHz.

It&#x27;s currently going for $1799, a $601 drop from its MSRP of $2400. That&#x27;s still a lot of money, but it&#x27;s a great deal on a flagship-grade gaming laptop.

                              <span>Video games are arguably the only form of entertainment you need these days, but hey, who doesn&#x27;t like an extra bit of pop culture on the old tellybox now and then, eh? Maybe you&#x27;re actually seated on a throne of graphic novels and comic books while you read this. Stranger things have happened. If that sounds like an accurate description of your fine self, then behold! Our corporate family at Reedpop have just launched Popverse, a new site dedicated to covering comic books, movies (films if you’re British) and anime and manga. 
There’s already a starship&#x27;s load of features about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC movies and Star Wars on there, so go have a readathon. The relaunched site also covers the professional wrestling scene, which is surely even more fantastical than Tolkien’s greatest works.

The game&#x27;s first PvP beta drew to a close today, but we should find out what&#x27;s next for the hero shooter at next month&#x27;s event. The blog post doesn&#x27;t give much away, all told, but according to the game&#x27;s official Twitter account the event will include more details about its next PvP beta. Fingers crossed for an invite this time.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that little inconsequential choices are better than controlling a turret. I am pleased that quite a few people did actually pick turrets. But this week, in the name of experimentation, I&#x27;m trying an approach that seems frankly inefficient. What if we... picked between two similar things? While I can&#x27;t imagine many will think this good, let&#x27;s give it a go, for science. Tell me, what&#x27;s better: random critical hits, or controlled critical hits?

I just hope the water in the kettle doesn’t come from the bathhouse.

                              <span>Time travel stories can have pretty high stakes, because usually you only travel in time when you really need to change something. A killer robot is trying to kill a lady because of something her son will eventually do, that kind of thing. My favourite episodes of Doctor Who, by contrast, were always the ones where the Doctor met a miserable dog-alien thousands of years in the future, and the dog alien is like &quot;Not only is the planet about to blow, but my marriage is in trouble,&quot; and then the episode was mostly about the latter issue rather than the former. This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. 
To save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about. The beat of a butterfly&#x27;s wing, indeed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been about eight months since I first had a hands-off sneak peek at the new and about-to-be-rebooted Saints Row, and six since we&#x27;ve heard it was being delayed to August this year. With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you&#x27;d expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.
Barring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It&#x27;s a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like &quot;cops&quot;, &quot;switch car&quot; and &quot;plan&quot;, leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can&#x27;t think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.

                              <span>3D gaming is… well, if not dead, then at best being kept in an iron lung by a teensy niche of enthusiasts. However, Acer will be making another attempt to take it semi-mainstream when it releases the Predator Helios 300 SpatialLabs Edition gaming laptop in September 2022. Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.

                              <span>From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.
This is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren&#x27;t exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn&#x27;t an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though.

There&#x27;s no release date just yet, but have a watch of the teaser trailer below. It looks a real treat.

                              <span>Wetlands, the newest supported game of the Hypno engine, is ready for public testing!
This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.
Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive.
ScummVM currently supports the English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean releases of the game and features improved controls as well. You can support ScummVM by buying Wetlands from GOG.com via our referral link. Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
