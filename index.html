Every now and then companies will send out surveys to diehard fans asking what kind of games they would like to see in the future based on certain franchises. We&#x27;ve seen Atlus and others like Capcom do this, and most recently it seems Nintendo has issued one, specifically about Pokémon.
As highlighted by a post on the MysteryDungeon subreddit (via My Nintendo News), Nintendo has begun sending out surveys to anyone signed up to receive My Nintendo promotions and newsletters. The survey wants to know what kind of games Pokémon fans would like to see from the series in the future.

                              <span>The new rewards roll out in October in North America
Sony&#x27;s new loyalty program is going live next month in North America. PlayStation Stars is rolling out for PlayStation users, starting today and spreading to more regions over the coming weeks.
The Stars launch kicks off in Asia first, where regions there will see the program go live on September 29. North and South America will get PlayStation Stars on October 5, while the program heads to Europe and Australia on October 13.
If you missed the initial announcement, PlayStation Stars is a loyalty program for owners of Sony&#x27;s console. While it&#x27;s free and doesn&#x27;t require PlayStation Plus to enroll, Plus users will get some extra bonuses to their Stars.
By completing campaigns and activities, Stars users can earn rewards. Some might ask you to get a specific trophy, while another might be becoming the first player to platinum a game in their region. One of the first campaigns, dubbed &quot;Hit Play/1994,&quot; has members who correctly guess launch games based on song-based clues get a special collectible.

Rewards for Stars
What can you use these rewards for? Well, one type of reward is loyalty points. These can be redeemed in a catalog that may include PSN wallet funds, digital collectibles, or certain PlayStation Store products. Plus members automatically accrue points for purchases on the Store, too.
Those digital collectibles are the other reward, and don&#x27;t worry. Sony VP Grace Chen told the Washington Post that these are not NFTs. As today&#x27;s blog post reiterates, these cannot be sold or traded. They might be rare, but they aren&#x27;t one-of-a-kind and they don&#x27;t use any blockchain technology. These little collectibles will be visible on a display case within the PlayStation app, which can be viewed by other users.
You can get more info and make sure you&#x27;re signed up when it goes live over at the PlayStation Stars page.

Getting to play a game&#x27;s beta before its release is definitely exciting, but it&#x27;s not without its downsides — because said game isn&#x27;t out yet, it can come with a whole slew of bugs that still need working out, which can range from minor inconveniences to game-breaking issues. While the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II beta was a blast to play, of course, a few problems have stood out to players more than others. Specifically, players complained about imbalanced footsteps audio, as well as issues with enemy visibility.
No need to fret, though, because Infinity Ward has announced that they&#x27;re already on the case to fix these bugs, and more, before Modern Warfare II&#x27;s full launch. &quot;While sentiment around footstep audio was more positive i…</span>

Horror is a fun little genre. It’s like drama, but it tries to open up your bowels. And we, as humans, are afraid of so many things. Some things we’ve come up with on our own terrify us. Sometimes we’ve decided that things intended to cause joy instead cause fear. It’s great! You don’t even need something tangible, life itself is one long horrifying experience!
The Fridge is Red is a bit of a departure from the usual grotesque slasher horror I’ve been indulging in lately. It’s psychological beyond just, “look out, that cat has got a knife!” It’s downright surreal, nailing what dreams would probably be like if I could dream about something aside from noodles. Unfortunately, while it happens to be consistently arresting with its vis…</span>

Bandai Namco is the latest developer/publisher to announce the formation of its own in-house music label. Emanating out of its European offices, the amusingly titled &quot;Bandai Namco Game Music Label&quot; will publish soundtracks of the studio&#x27;s games in a physical and digital capacity.
&quot;Since the first video games and all throughout the history of the industry, music has always been a core component of the gaming experience,&quot; said the studio in a press statement. &quot;Music made the games’ memories last longer and followed the players into their daily lives with amazing soundtracks to go back to and relive the stories they played.&quot;
&quot;We strive to delight our fans with more than just games, so we decided to bring video game music to as many listeners as possible, with the release of two digital albums of game background music.&quot;
The first two releases from the label are the soundtrack to the smash-selling RPG Elden Ring, which launched digitally earlier this month, and Motoi Sakuraba&#x27;s soundtrack to anime adventure title Tales of Arise, which launches today. Both records can be purchased via several music streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and the iTunes Store, among others. The Bandai Namco Game Music Label intends to build upon this catalog of memorable and evocative scores.
Most recently, French publisher Microids also announced the formation of its own record label. You can read all about it in our previous article right here.

If you didn&#x27;t pick up Hot Wheels Unleashed at launch (and recent sales didn&#x27;t tempt you), then October should be a good month for PlayStation Plus. Milestone&#x27;s well-liked arcade racing game joins the lineup for PS Plus Essential subscribers alongside NetherRealm&#x27;s superhero fighter Injustice 2 and the minimalist action-shooter classic Superhot.

We&#x27;re not that far removed from the massive Genshin Impact 3.0 Sumeru update, but 3.1 is already upon us. The core focus is a new desert zone to compliment the lush scenery of Sumeru, as well as three characters (Cyno, Candace, and Nilou). So there are a few things to keep in mind that are happening in tandem with the update.

                              <span>When the bough breaks...
Endless nightmares, hand-drawn weirdness, and twin-stick shmup action sound like a pretty bizarre list of ingredients for a video game concept, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped Japanese indie studio Neotro from mixing &#x27;em up and creating the fascinating new release, NeverAwake, which launches today on PC.
NeverAwake is a twin-stick shmup set within a terrifying, never-ending sleep. A young girl, Rem, is plagued by a litany of daily troubles, all of which have suddenly chosen to manifest themselves into her dreams as unholy nightmares. Now trapped within a dungeon of her own plights and worries, Rem is forced to face each and every one of her fears, conjuring up an array of firepower and other abilities to take down the nasties.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;M-HMu7sdhas
Be it violent neighborhood dogs, the mean girls from high school, trips to the surgeon, or even those horrid vegetables she has to eat at mealtimes, Rem must steel herself against her own brain spiders, conquering these demons once and for all if she is ever to escape this literal nightmare and return to the waking world. NeverAwake boasts around 80 looped levels of action, complete with an array of grotesque bosses, hand-drawn visuals, an arsenal of dynamic weaponry, and even multiple endings, all painted against relentless, blood-pumping shmup action.
NeverAwake is available now on PC via Steam. You can also purchase the new title bundled with a digital artbook and the game&#x27;s soundtrack. For console fans, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports of NeverAwake will launch in January 2023, with physical editions to follow on both platforms.

                              <span>Setting sail for a more distant port
Ubisoft&#x27;s multiplayer piracy game Skull and Bones is getting another delay. Today, the publisher confirms that it&#x27;s charting a course for Skull and Bones to launch on March 9, 2023.
The team attributes work being done polishing and balancing the experience ahead of its release. &quot;To give you the best possible experience we&#x27;ve decided to take a little more time to make sure we can deliver exactly that,&quot; the statement reads.
Kotaku, which broke the news just ahead of its official confirmation, reports that a recent Skull and Bones technical test ended on September 19. A source who was involved in the test told Kotaku that while the gameplay was &quot;more refined&quot; than previous ones, overall player progression still seemed &quot;shallow.&quot;
Ubisoft confirms it plans to host an open beta of Skull and Bones in the near future. No date&#x27;s been set for that yet.

A pirate&#x27;s life for me
Skull and Bones had finally locked in a firm date for this year, set for November 8. The piracy sim has spent years in development, experiencing several delays and pushbacks along the way. Its studio, Ubisoft Singapore, was also the subject of reports about its internal culture, alongside broader issues reported at Ubisoft.
While it&#x27;s been floating around in the water for a while, the November release seemed optimistic. Skull and Bones was one of the games featured at the recent Ubisoft Forward. With a good chunk of gameplay and showcase spotlight, Skull and Bones seemed set to sail.
Ubisoft also rolled out a bunch of its plans for Assassin&#x27;s Creed and more at that showcase. As for this year though, there is still Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. And yes, the Rabbids talk in this new one.
Skull and Bones is still planned as a current-gen console game, arriving on PC, Stadia, Luna, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on March 9, 2023.

                              <span>Wiglett wobbles but it won&#x27;t fall down
A new Pokemon has been revealed for upcoming Switch entries Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and it&#x27;s a tall, wiggly one. Wiglett is a new Pokemon for the Paldea region.
Teased today in a new video on the World Pokemon Ecological Society site, Wiglett joins the Paldean lineup. You can sit through the lecture online, which also shows some other regional Pokemon like Paldean Wooper, or just check out the video below via Serebii.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;pQoVAMGli0E
Now, astute viewers may note that Wiglett shares some similarities with longtime Generation 1 mainstay Diglett. The burrowing Pokemon has a recognizable look, and Wiglett does indeed look a lot like Diglett. The video calls attention to this fact, too.
As it goes on to stress though, this Pokemon is clearly different. It&#x27;s longer, for one. And it lives near water, in the sand.
&quot;The form and movements indeed look like Diglett, but they are probably different Pokemon,&quot; the video states. So there you go.
A new region to explore
We&#x27;ve seen a bunch of the new monsters in store for this new mainline Pokemon entry. There&#x27;s the neon monkey Grafaiai, the absolute perfection of Lechonk, and the two new box art Legendary Pokemon. Those two even act as your rideable mounts for the new game, helping you travel across the land of Paldea.
The extra travel will help, as there&#x27;s a lot to do in Scarlet and Violet. There are essentially three main storylines, with one following the usual Gym battles and others dealing with different situations in the region.
As for Wiglett, it&#x27;s an interesting design, if a little unsettling. It looks like Diglett was rolled out like dough. Still, the little mole Pokemon was a fun one to have around in the original generation, and these goofy monsters seem fun too.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet launches for Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.

Another Splatoon 3 patch is scheduled to be released on September 30, thanks to heads-up on Nintendo of Japan&#x27;s support site.
The core focus of this patch is to address communication errors (disconnects), which reared up quite a bit after launch, into the most recent Splatfest. Three fixes address specific weapon/button combination bugs, amid other issues (like game crashes when using the locker system in a specific manner). Thankfully, this patch will retroactively fix several problems, including a catalog (a seasonal reward track) bug.
As a reminder, Nintendo plans on updating Splatfest matches more in the future. Keep in mind that the below patch notes are roughly translated, but they get the point across. Once the patch is actually out, typically in the early m…</span>

                              <span>Shinier demons for all
Two titles from Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology have received current-gen upgrades on PlayStation and Xbox — As noted by VGC, the upgrades appear to be free to all players who currently own the requisite PS4/Xbox One editions of 2019&#x27;s Man of Medan and/or its 2020 follow-up, Little Hope.
The new PS5 and Xbox Series X editions of the creepy horror releases will feature improved visuals and reduced load times. In addition, a new update released for all versions of the games includes a litany of tweaks and features. These include an improved U.I.; new difficulty and QTE settings; improved walking speeds for certain sequences and characters; updated event triggers; and some new accessibility options, which include more sizing choices for the games&#x27; subtitles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SD60VTe7VC8
Man of Medan also receives a revised chapter, &quot;Flooded&quot;, which introduces new gameplay elements and a selection of possible new deaths for the seafaring adventure&#x27;s climax. The third title in the horror anthology, House of Ashes, is already available on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is thus unlikely to receive a similar tech upgrade. As for the future of the franchise, several titles were trademarked by Supermassive earlier in the year, including O Death, The Craven Man, Directive 8020, Intercession, and finally Winterfold.
I really want to play them all, truly. But I am, unfortunately, a massive scaredy cat.
The Dark Pictures Anthology is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Hunting games are rising in popularity even more so thanks to the success of Monster Hunter World and Rise, and now more companies are getting back into the genre that once flourished on platforms like the PSP. Thanks to its debut trailer, we now have a better idea of what to actually expect.
Described as &quot;the land of the beast,&quot; the game&#x27;s world (Azuma) seems to be fairly varied, with several different biomes. We see that the area is &quot;fraught with danger,&quot; as the player character fights giant monsters (Kemono, which were once peaceful) with unconventional weapons like umbrellas and …</span>

SNK has announced the release date for the next team of DLC fighters headed toward its fab scrapper The King of Fighters XV — Team Samurai, consisting of Samurai Shodown stars Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Darli Dagger, will be available to download on PC and console platforms from October 4.
The new faction is, obviously, something of a crossover affair, and will see the SamSho posse step up to the plate against KoF&#x27;s finest. I&#x27;m not 100% sure how Queensbury Rules Darli&#x27;s enormous saw-sword is in a fistfight, but given that the KoF krew have literal superpowers, we can probably let it slide. While Haohmaru and Nakoruru are series veterans, this is only Darli&#x27;s second gaming appearance, having made her debut in the ace 2019 Samurai Shodown release.

Team Samurai will represent the fourth batch of DLC characters to join KoF XV&#x27;s enormous roster since the title&#x27;s initial launch earlier this year. The next season, which will kick off in 2023, has already promised to bring about the return of some KoF veterans. These include Kyo Kusanagi&#x27;s well-meaning protege Shingo Yabuki, and the honorable taekwondo expert and criminal reformer Kim Kaphwan. Given Street Fighter 6&#x27;s imminent launch and its wickedly redesigned Juri, it looks like it is going to be a fine year for windy, billowing taekwondo pants.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms — Additionally, Samurai Shodown 2019 will receive a rollback netcode update next spring, which will hopefully bring about a resurgence of interest in the solid, if misunderstood, fighting title.

Yesterday saw Player First Games&#x27; brawler MultiVersus receive a brand new update, bringing with it bug fixes, balance changes, the arrival of new fighter Rick Sanchez and, of course, a fresh new batch of character rumors, brought about by those crafty, crafty PC dataminers.
Much like with the previous update, tinkerers have been playing around with the source code of Version 1.03 of MultiVersus and have found secrets buried within. These secrets come in the form of a new &quot;Announcers Pack,&quot; that contains narration recorded by DC Comics&#x27; Clown Prince of Crime himself, Joker. This would, obviously, suggest that Gotham City&#x27;s deadliest is getting set to join the MV roster somewhere down the line — This is an inevitability that will surely come as no surprise to anybody.
You can check out the unearthed dialogue in the tweet below, posted online by @LaisulMV.
https://twitter.com/LaisulMV/status/1574811514489405440?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;ZGFG1IqOumrxd_N_YojfQA
While this is unconfirmed at this time, the dialogue appears to have been recorded by Mark Hamill, who famously played Joker in the award-winning Batman: The Animated Series, and is considered one of the very best portrayals of the psychopathic criminal in the canon. Splashing out on authentic voices and top-tier characters is partly responsible for MultiVersus success, giving the platform fighter a distinction above some of the other Smash Bros. clones on the market.
Previously, dataminers had uncovered voice lines for two more unannounced stars, The Wizard of OZ&#x27;s Wicked Witch of the West, and The Ghost with The Most: Beetlejuice. To date, neither of these roster additions have been referenced in any official capacity, so these characters may be waiting in the wings for further seasons. At least sweetie-pie Harley will finally be getting a measure of revenge on ol&#x27; Mr. J.
MultiVersus is currently in free-to-play open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Today on Spot Dodge the crew discusses Nintendo’s downright unmatched game release cadence as a publisher.
Nintendo is one of the very few publishers that seem to work way ahead of schedule — the company has been known to “sit on” fully completed games until it can find an open slot to put them in its release schedule. Not only is that almost unheard of in today’s gaming economy, but most publishers are quick to release games before they’re done cooking. We’ve seen it time and time again — Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite, No Man’s Sky, Cyberp…</span>

                              <span>It was only a matter of time
In my opinion, Trombone Champ is one of the best things to happen to gaming all year. It&#x27;s easy for anyone to pick up, it&#x27;s well-designed, and it&#x27;s laugh-out-loud goofy. I was skeptical when I heard someone say it&#x27;s a Game of the Year contender, but it only took a few minutes into playing it to make me a believer. Now that the game&#x27;s popularity has launched into the stratosphere, thanks to word of mouth on social media, we&#x27;re starting to see the mods slowly roll in, which is exciting for someone who is very much a fan of mods.
Mods don&#x27;t just include putting Trombone Champ in VR or adding custom song maps, however — it also means that players who modify their game to take custom controller inputs are back on the scene. In this case, it&#x27;s my man Rudeism, a streamer known for his modified controller setups. At this point, I&#x27;m basically his full-fledged fan. This time, he hooked up a real trombone to play its virtual counterpart in the game.
https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1574760613683023879?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;rEXbyltnL1uM9nxDgm62pA
According to his Twitter post, an &quot;ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting.&quot; I have no idea what any of that means, but he clearly got it working in Trombone Champ, so good on him. Rudeism also states in his post that he wishes he could play the trombone IRL, which has me wondering: did he full-on buy a trombone for this bit? Those things aren&#x27;t exactly cheap, so that level of commitment is admirable, to say the least. Who knows, maybe this will be the beginning of an illustrious career for him as a concert trombonist.
Either way, this real trombone Trombone Champ setup did exactly what it was supposed to — make me happy — and isn&#x27;t that all we can ask for from our internet content these days? Now if anyone needs me, I&#x27;ll be trying to top my high scores until someone mods K-pop songs into the game.

                              <span>Turns out early access isn’t just for games. The Amazon Prime Early Access Sale is taking place this October 11th-12th, a full six weeks before Black Friday 2022, and from a PC gaming standpoint will offer the same kinds of component and peripheral deals as that annual pre-Christmas shoppingfest. Just earlier.
That said, the Prime Early Access Sale isn’t purely a prelude to the anything-goes chaos of Black Friday. It’s more like a Prime Day 2, in that it’s an Amazon-only event, with all the best deals set to be require Amazon Prime membership to access. That’s right, it’s one of those.

                              <span>What appears to be an announcer pack voiced by Mark Hamill and leaked from Warner Bros licensed brawler MultiVersus indicates that The Joker might be arriving in a future update. Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it&#x27;s a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we&#x27;re now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director&#x27;s cut special editions. We&#x27;ve included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month&#x27;s Time Capsule, but there&#x27;s another notable exception we&#x27;ve decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016&#x27;s Special Edition?

                              <span>There&#x27;s a definition of &quot;pure&quot; that&#x27;s proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I&#x27;m genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many &#x27;retro&#x27; inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

                              <span>It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Seems it’s that time of year again: the annual Intel CPU refresh is upon us, with CEO Pat Gelsinger announcing the 13th Gen &quot;Raptor Lake&quot; processor family onstage at Intel Innovation 2022 last night. These chips will stick to the hybrid Performance core/Efficiency core design introduced by the 12th Gen Alder Lake range – probably wisely, given that includes some of the best gaming CPUs ever – but ups the E-core counts, L2 cache capacities and clock speeds. Raptor Lake will go on sale on October 20th, a few weeks after the just-launched AMD Ryzen 7000 series.
The showcase also included a few key details on the Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition, the top-ranking graphics card in the long-delayed Arc Alchemist lineup of gaming GPUs. This will also launch next month, on October 12th, and cost $329. Honestly, part of me was wondering if we’ll ever see the day, but yes: there really will be an Intel graphics card on the market. Even if it is more of an RTX 3060 rival than a cheap RTX 4080 alternative.

                              <span>Shoehorning in appearances by pop-culture favourites du jour isn’t something you’d normally associate with Overwatch, but Blizzard are considering it in some form or another for Overwatch 2. Overwatch VP Jon Spector discussed brand crossovers during an interview with Game Informer, saying that Blizzard is “interested in exploring” partnerships like those you might see in Fortnite. Although, he did qualify that it would have to be in keeping with the Overwatch franchise.

This means you can mete out justice with your fists and do some important detective work... and do some drone racing... and participate in some robot wars. It&#x27;s Yakuza with a murder-mystery twist that&#x27;s well worth your while even if you&#x27;re not actually that big on Kiryu or Ichiban&#x27;s antics. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

                              <span>It&#x27;s tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob&#x27;s Barrows&#x27; arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn&#x27;t care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It&#x27;s a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob&#x27;s Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn&#x27;t a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina&#x27;s eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

It&#x27;s five years to the day since Jupiter&#x27;s long-running puzzle series first made the jump to Switch with Picross S, and please forgive us if we get a little nostalgic.
With the eighth entry in the S saga coming to the Switch eShop in a matter of hours, there&#x27;s no denying that each new entry amounts to a fresh DLC pack featuring dozens of new nonograms to dive into, yet we&#x27;ve got real affection for this most dependable of puzzlers. Given its quality and the calm mood it puts us in, we&#x27;ll happily lap up another selection of the same-old every six months.

                              <span>Voodoo you think you are?
You may have heard of a little game releasing on Switch this month – a point-and-click graphic adventure featuring Voodoo mysticism, set in the Caribbean and with music by Peter McConnell, composer on Monkey Island 2? That’s right! It’s Voodoo Detective, the magical, mystical debut from Short Sleeve Studio, hot on the heels of fan-craze juggernaut Return to Monkey Island. Timing-wise, this Switch release is like arriving at a fancy dress party with a rubber glove on your head and yoghurt pot on your nose, only to meet Mel Gibson wearing the rooster suit from Chicken Run.
However, having taken advantage of that particular monkey in the room for an intro paragraph, we can confess that Voodoo Detective is very much its own thing – not simply the comedy Caribbean voodoo graphic adventure a grandparent bought you by mistake. The setting is Zo Wanga Isle, an island increasingly overrun by tourists thanks to the growing commercial operations of a corrupt corporation, Island Ventures. Native Zowangians like Voodoo Detective (that’s his name – competing for silliness with his brother Donut Hole Billy) are squeezed by real estate development and profit-digging commerce, cashing in on the local climate and culture.

Gameloft has given Disney Dreamlight Valley players a heads-up as to what updates to expect in the game over the coming weeks — yes, it really is October very soon (less than a week, even!). And perhaps the biggest thing to note is that the iconic villain from The Lion King, Scar, is coming to the game &quot;in around 3 weeks&quot;.
Previously announced for Fall 2022, it looks like Scar will be hitting that window comfortably. Though the developer can&#x27;t promise the exact date of Scar&#x27;s arrival in the game, he will be coming alongside a slew of bug fixes for the game.

Ah, Sonic Frontiers... The game isn&#x27;t even out and yet it seems everyone and their nan has given their own hot take on Sega&#x27;s latest entry.
After some pretty poor gameplay demonstrations earlier this year, public opinion has slowly become more positive as we get closer to that November 8th release date, with incremental updates from Sega indicating that, actually, maybe this isn&#x27;t the dumpster fire that many are fearing it to be.

The fabulous folks over at Playtonic Games, the developer behind Yooka Laylee and Yooka Laylee and the Impossible Lair and publisher of Demon Turf, BPM: Bullets Per Minute, and Lil Gator Game, will be holding a charity auction next Friday, 7th October, to raise money for SpecialEffect&#x27;s &#x27;One Special Day&#x27; event.
Special Effect is a UK-based charity in the UK that was founded and set up in 2007 to help physically disabled kids play video games. The organisation is a pillar in the gaming accessibility space and has been a part of the cause to create controllers that can use inputs from any part of the body, among many other things.

                              <span>But it has now been removed from sale.
We never really expected to write about anything like this, but Automaton Media has reported on a rather unusual fan-made Kirby card game. That seems relatively harmless on its own — despite the fact that it&#x27;s a card game featuring Kirby, a pretty huge Nintendo property, that was being sold on the Japanese marketplace BOOTH — but when we tell you there&#x27;s a micro bikini-clad Chef Kawasaki, you might raise an eyebrow.
Chef Kawasaki’s Microbikini Karuta is based on &#x27;karuta&#x27;, a type of Japanese playing card that was introduced to the country by Portuguese traders back in the 1600s. There are two types of karuta — Uta-Garuta, the former working with a much larger deck with the latter aimed more at children. Nintendo itself used to sell these kinds of cards as far back as 1890. Tofuga has a pretty excellent summary of just what karuta cards are if you&#x27;re curious about the details.

However, Twitter account has since been spotted — and verified — for the movie!
Without making a single post, the @supermariomovie account has already amassed 13.6k followers (by our latest count). This, combined with the account&#x27;s verified status, definitely makes us think that we are looking at the real deal here, and thousands of followers seem to agree. If you thought that the anticipation had gone down the warp pipe, think again.

More than twenty years after its initial inception, chances are you know by now whether or not the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise is for you. Featuring rhythmic gameplay via four methods of control (buttons, touch screen, motion controls, or the drum accessory itself), the new entry from Bandai Namco — Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival — does little to freshen up the tried-and-tested formula, but instead focuses on providing more of the same for existing fans.
It’s a largely successful approach, but those hoping for a more in-depth gameplay experience similar to something like Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythmic Adventure Pack may find Rhythm Festival a tad lacking.

Harvestella is one of about ninety (haha, joking) farming sims launching on the Switch in the coming months, so naturally Sqaure Enix will be keen to show off more of the game and get the hype train rolling ahead of its official release on November 4th.
We&#x27;ve already been treated to a demo (and be sure to tell us what you think of it!), but Square Enix has now lifted the lid on a whole heap of features, focusing on the beautiful season of Summer and introducing us to a couple of new job classes, a new location, and some yummy food.

Publisher Forever Entertainment has announced that Magical Drop VI will be launching on Nintendo Switch this Winter, marking a return for the Japanese puzzle franchise after the most recent entry, Magical Drop V, released way back in 2012 on Steam.
The Magical Drop series features classic colour-matching gameplay and has previously seen launches on consoles like the Neo geo Arcade, Super Famicom, Sega Saturn, and Game Boy Color. The latest entry for the Switch look to be sticking to the tried-and-tested formula, albeit with multiple modes including Story, Arcade, Path od Destiny, and online play.

The astronomical rise of Splatoon 3 was always going to result in players finding exploits in the game, but we didn&#x27;t think that one such problem would let you splat players through walls.
Glance over Twitter, however, and it not only seems that this issue exists, but that players are using it to their own advantage. Because of course they are. The problem stems from the Sloshing Machine — a mainstay in the Splatoon franchise which is used to quickly spread ink via projectile and following splash damage - specifically, the large hitbox that the weapon possesses.

We&#x27;re not sure what it&#x27;s meant to be exactly yet, but it definitely looks like Gen I&#x27;s little mole-like &#x27;mon. Serebii, always quick on the mark, shared the discovery over on Twitter.

Overwatch 2 will arrive as a free-to-play game on the Nintendo Switch and other platforms very soon — on October 4th. Replacing the original Overwatch servers in the process, the sequel is set to introduce a huge number of new players to the online game increasing the prospect of disruptive behaviour and gameplay amongst the community.
Blizzard has now laid out its plan to tackle these issues via the introduction of the Defence Matrix — a new system designed to improve player interaction and deter disruptive behaviour which will release simultaneously with Overwatch 2.

                              <span>Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it&#x27;s slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game&#x27;s development. 
Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer&#x27;s cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been delayed again.

                              <span>Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo have revealed Wild Hearts, a new Monster Hunter-like game coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year. 
More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game&#x27;s reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You&#x27;ll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s a fan of Capcom&#x27;s long-running Monster Hunter series.

&quot;I&#x27;m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!&quot;
Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his &quot;Ask me about Loom&quot; badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you&#x27;re a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It&#x27;s the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the serie…</span>

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game&#x27;s modes and chat functions – this happens &quot;rapidly,&quot; Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing &quot;approximately 100 matches,&quot; a…</span>

                              <span>There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, &quot;ooo yes, very nice&quot; and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, &quot;oh, why do you exist?&quot; There&#x27;s also a rare third class of Pokémon I call &quot;weird lil things&quot; when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class&#x27; newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it&#x27;s just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii&#x27;s video below: 


I&#x27;m most excited to see Wiglett&#x27;s evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I&#x27;ll see that in another trainer&#x27;s party because I&#x27;m not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 differs from its predecessor by being free-to-play, which means it will be more vulnerable to players who are up to no good. Blizzard today outlined how they intend to prevent &quot;disruptive behaviour&quot; from players, including the use of SMS verification and machine learning. More awkwardly, game modes will be locked for first-time players, and Overwatch 1&#x27;s original heroes will only be unlocked &quot;over the course of approximately 100 matches.&quot;

The Altar Of Hope update is already live in the game’s experimental branch and is coming to the main game when devs Red Hook are satisfied with its stability. You can catch a glimpse of the bounty hunter in the teaser below.

                              <span>I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you&#x27;ll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the &#x27;git gud&#x27; kool-aid either. While I&#x27;ll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I&#x27;ve been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars&#x27; reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it&#x27;s become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I&#x27;ve chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

                              <span>Rhythm FPS Metal: Hellsinger only came out a couple of weeks ago, but if you’re already getting tired of its relentless heavy metal soundtrack then the game’s new modding tools should help. You can now pop in whatever music you want to listen to, not just metal. What genre did devs The Outsiders choose to show off this new feature? Lucifer’s very own favourite, jazz, of course. Brace yourself for some syncopated shenanigans before you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT&#x27;s concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

                              <span>As players of Image &amp; Form&#x27;s excellent SteamWorld Dig games will know, there is something innately calming about chiselling your way through a hunk of rock. In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that&#x27;s pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

The character will be floating down the River Thames, and HoYoVerse are staging an opportunity to get up close at Tower Bridge. Oh, and they’ve chosen the date of the extremely busy London Marathon as the start of Paimon’s journey along the Thames. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>The RPS squad has once again made the trek to London for EGX 2022. There was plenty to see at this year’s show and, as always, we ran some of our own booths. The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

There’s a few notable tweaks to MultiVersus in the patch, including a major change to XP between levels 3 and 15. You’ll need twice as much now. Developers Player First Games have tried to rein in infinite combos, too. You can get a look at Rick by watching the trailer below.

And it works! Making the act of evidence disposal an action-packed affair that makes it a great game to play in bursts.

                              <span>When Grounded released into early access a little over two years ago, it immediately became a personal favourite. The story wasn&#x27;t complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch. With two years of updates layering new enemies, items, biomes, dungeons, and quests onto that healthy foundation, Grounded has blossomed into a perennial survival game that sits comfortably among the very best of the genre.

                              <span>Developers aren&#x27;t hiding things from you, I promise
In the wake of the GTA VI leaks last week, a lot of people online made it very clear that they don’t know anything about how video games are made and embarrassed themselves online. One particularly egregious comment stated that visuals are the first thing finished in game development — which is just laughably false. Look, I’m as privy to making false assumptions as the next person, but &quot;fans&quot; going out of their way to harass game developers because they refuse to use Google’s most basic functionality is no one’s fault but their own.
I don’t mean to be harsh, and it is true that game development can be exclusive and gate-keepy — especially to those of marginalized backgrounds. But when it comes to situations where player expectations clash…</span>

                              <span>Drug arrest actor finally faces Judgment
Once Judgment hit the PC scene, it was inevitable that players would start to poke around with the title&#x27;s source code, as the PC krew are wont to do — case in point, this new mod, which restores the voice and visual likeness of actor Pierre Taki, who was patched out of the RPG shortly after its initial release.
The controversy came about way back in the spring of 2019, when the (then) 51-year-old actor was arrested for cocaine use. While no illicit substances were found at Taki&#x27;s home, the actor registered positive when tested for samples. Japan&#x27;s drug laws are among some of the world&#x27;s most stringent, and the event led Sega to immediately halt sales of Judgment in order to remove Taki from his role as the Tojo Clan&#x27;s subsidiary captain, Kyohei Hamura. Judgment would eventually return to the market, with Hamura sporting a brand new face and a re-recorded voice.
Clearly, however, his likeness and vocal performance remained buried within the source code of the PlayStation edition, as modder Timo654 has successfully adapted a similar PlayStation mod to now work with the new PC/Steam launch. The Pierre Taki mod for Judgment can be accessed via the NexusMods website, and is compatible with the popular trainer Ryu Mod Manager, which is utilized for the modding of titles within the Ryu ga Gotoku series.
As for Taki himself, the Tokyo District Court handed down a sentence of 18 months in jail for cocaine use. The sentence has a three-year suspension period. The actor has continued to work in film and television since the arrest.

The launch of Overwatch 2 is just a week away, and today Blizzard is announcing some new systems for its multiplayer shooter. Specifically, it&#x27;s addressing disruptive behavior and the first-time player experience in Overwatch 2.
One major part is the First Time User Experience, or FTUE. It&#x27;s designed for brand-new Overwatch 2 players, who make an account after the game has launched.
According to Blizzard, a consistent piece of feedback is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s modes and hero pool. Under the FTUE, new users will gradually unlock pieces of Overwatch 2.
This starts with modes and chat, in the first phase. Then phase two will have players unlock all of the original Overwatch heroes. Blizzar…</span>

                              <span>Anybody call for a web-slinger?
Sony Interactive Entertainment and Insomniac Games have released a short trailer teasing the arrival of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PC. The new port of the smash-selling PlayStation title will come wall-crawling onto Steam and Epic Games Store platforms sometime this fall.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;D3wEP8kJ6Vo
Released in November 2020 as a PS5 launch title, The Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man pseudo-sequel follows the adventures of young Miles Morales, who is forced to step up his game as Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man when his home district of Harlem is severely threatened by the collateral damage of a war between greedy capitalists and a violent criminal element, led by the malevolent Tinkerer. Having only just discovered his calling as Spider-Man, Morales is pushed to hit the ground running in order to save his community from annihilation.
Much like its beloved predecessor Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, Miles Morales was celebrated by both video game and comic-book fans for its authentic replication of the Spiderverse and its popular cast of characters. Critics praised the follow-up&#x27;s slick and engaging gameplay, fluid combat, and improved range of side-missions and activities. This new port will represent the latest in an increasing catalog of PlayStation titles that are making the leap to the PC platform — a library that also includes games from popular Sony franchises including Uncharted, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn.
Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will launch on PC this fall. It is available now on PlayStation platforms. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered is also available on PS5 and PC.

We took the entire Splatoon 3 amiibo line for a spin at launch, but there&#x27;s still three missing! A trio is due out this &quot;holiday season,&quot; and while we don&#x27;t have a full picture of what they&#x27;ll unlock, we can see them up close thanks to a new YouTube video from Gaming Boulevard.
Taken at the Heroes Comic Con/Made in Asia convention in Brussels, Belgium, this past weekend; and were on display thanks to the Made in Asia portion of the convention (which features manga, anime, video games, YouTubers and cosplay).
As a reminder, these are the three that are still due in the future:
Octoling (Blue)
Inkling (Yellow)
Smallfry
The general quality of amiibo has skyrocketed over the years (especially compared to the launch lineup), and you can really see the difference with these close-up shots. Smallfry (the companion in Splatoon 3 that also serves a mechanical purpose in-game) is probably going to be a fan favorite figure, as that pose looks even funnier with the real thing on display.
If I had to guess, the idol trio (Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, who all comprise &quot;Deep Cut&quot;) could come out sometime in 2023 as Splatoon 3 amiibo: potentially coinciding with some sort of Splatoon 3 update/expansion. All Splatoon idols have been represented so far in amiibo form.
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

Publisher Atlus has taken the somewhat brutish step of filing suit against a party of Shin Megami Tensei fans who allegedly created an unofficial server for the now-defunct SMT MMO, Imagine. In related news, a fan server, titled &quot;ReImagine&quot; has been operating since 2020, but has now, understandably, been taken offline. The suit was initially spotted by Twitter user &quot;Marsh&quot;.
According to the lawsuit, (viewable here at CourtListener) Atlus is seeking around $25,000 per copyright violation, citing the &quot;irreparable damage&quot; that the Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine recreation has caused to the publisher. The defendants are identified &quot;Rekuiemu&quot; and &quot;COMP_Hack&quot; which the suit alleges are responsible for the creation of the unofficial MMO, its engine, and its front end.

                              <span>&quot;So that everyone has the same experience&quot;
According to the game&#x27;s producer, the approach to difficulty in Wo Long: Fallen Kingdom will be similar to how From Software (and Team Ninja itself) has handled many of their games in the past: there&#x27;s one non-negotiable setting.
Speaking to MP1st, here&#x27;s what producer Masaaki Yamagiwa had to say on the matter: &quot;We’re thinking it’s good to have one set difficulty so that everyone has the same experience of overcoming a really intense obstacle and they all have that feeling of achievement, like &#x27;I did it.&#x27; But the caveat there is giving players all different ways that they can do that.&quot; They go on to comment that you could &quot;talk to your friends&quot; about beating a boss, and share that experience.
They also clarify that Wo Long is &quot;not an easy game,&quot; but they want to give players &quot;as much freedom and agency to play it as they want.&quot; Part of that freedom and agency is the morale system, which Yamagiwa explains: &quot;One thing that comes to mind is the morale system. You have a morale rank and as you keep increasing it you get stronger and you can use that to choose which enemies to fight, or raise it up so you can take on a harder enemy and maybe they’ll be a little bit easier now that you’re stronger.&quot; That system was actually present in the demo, and while it&#x27;s confusing at first, it&#x27;s another tool in the tool kit in terms of squaring up opponents. Think of it like a micro-leveling system, where you (or your enemies) can raise your power level.
In any case, the &quot;single difficulty setting&quot; conversation is bound to have a lot of different takes, but at least we know where Wo Long stands either way. Given Team Ninja&#x27;s recent takes on action adventure romps, this isn&#x27;t a surprise.

                              <span>Multi-monitor support and a bevy of graphics options
The Bat-Family&#x27;s new escapades aren&#x27;t far off now. Today, WB Montreal released a new trailer highlighting some of the options PC players will have for their crimefighting ventures in Gotham Knights.
In a special PC trailer, we get to see some more of the crew in action, as well as footage captured using the PC version. Gotham Knights will support 4K resolution and ultra-high frame rate options, as well as ray traced reflections.
WB Games also confirms that Gotham Knights will have Intel&#x27;s XeSS A.I.-enhanced upscaling as an option. More options are shown in the trailer, including a menu full of toggles like resolution render and FPS limits, as well TAA upsample and more.
Particularly cool is the option to support ultrawide and multi-monitor PC setups for Gotham Knight. You know, so you can play the new Bat game on a Batcave-style computer layout.

Basically, there are a bunch of tools and toggles for making the Bat-family&#x27;s fight for Gotham look really pretty.
The fight for Gotham
Gotham Knights is the new title from WB Games Montreal. Rather than following Batman like other Arkham-style games, though, this one sees the associated Bat-crew taking up his mantle after Bruce&#x27;s untimely departure.
Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood are all playable, and the story looks set to focus in on the mysterious Court of Owls. Still, today&#x27;s trailer is a reminder that we won&#x27;t just be seeing owl masks all the time; other villains like Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn will also be showing up to cause some chaos.
The added PC options are nice to see, especially as Gotham Knights is focusing on the current generation of console hardware. Hopefully it results in a good-looking Gotham to roam around in.
Gotham Knights lands for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21.

Ember Labs&#x27; beautiful and ethereal adventure title Kena: Bridge of Spirits is now available to purchase on the Steam platform, following on from its 2021 release on PlayStation and one-year exclusivity deal with Epic Games Store. This anniversary re-release also brings with it some fun new bonus items.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;axkJPUVpjWU
Kena: Bridge of Spirits is something of a mood piece, following the zen-like adventure of the titular young spirit guide as she embarks upon a journey to guide the recently departed from the plains of reality to their eternal resting place in the spirit realm. While the title does feature world traversal, puzzle-solving, and combat elements, it must be noted that the adventure is more a trek to be enjoyed than a challenge to overcome. In any regard, Kena is a very attractive and charismatic venture, and deserving of the plaudits directed toward its visuals, audio, and satisfying mechanics.
In addition to the Steam launch, a new &quot;Anniversary Update&quot; is available to download for free on all platforms. The package adds a New Game+ feature, Spirit Guide trials, new Charmstones, and various accessories and outfits for our lovely protagonist. Deluxe Edition owners will get an exclusive bonus outfit. If you&#x27;re yet to pick up Kena, and are intrigued by this release, then note that the Steam release is currently available to purchase at a discounted price for the first week of sale, so move fast!
Kena: Bridge of Spirits is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

A Capcom Fighting Collection update is on the way, and will feature several quality-of life enhancements like viewable hitboxes.
Due out on all platforms on September 27, Capcom has boasted the following updates:
Viewable hitboxes
New gem colors for Puzzle Fighter
The option to see your opponent&#x27;s connection status
So the first one is obviously the crown jewel, as it&#x27;ll allow players to view more technical information when training, presumably across the entire array of games in the collection. It&#x27;ll be fascinating to see if any new tech arises from some of the more obscure titles in those scenes. Gem color options for Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is just how it sounds, and seems like an aesthetic update, but will actually add more options for colorblind players. …</span>

In the Crossbell criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important, groups: the police, who everyone hates, and the government, who are more corrupt than a backwoods southern lawyer. These are their stories.

                              <span>New IP rights retained by studio
Developer People Can Fly (Outriders, Bulletstorm) announced that it has had its cooperation agreement terminated by publisher Take-Two Interactive. This motion severely affects the current development plans for People Can Fly&#x27;s &quot;Project Dagger&quot;, a title that has been in production at the developer&#x27;s New York studio for the past two years.
The news was revealed in People Can Fly&#x27;s latest financial update, where it is stated that Take-Two, the publisher behind such behemoths as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, had essentially pulled out of the project entirely, leaving Project Dagger with a developer, but no publisher to handle its eventual marketing and release. Take-Two seemingly chose not to purchase the rights to the project, which will be retained by the studio.
Addressing the turbulent situation, People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says that he &quot;assumes&quot; the two companies will part on good terms, and expresses the studio&#x27;s desire to continue development on the title, with an eye to finding a new publisher, or perhaps even self-publishing. Project Dagger, which remains under wraps, had been described previously as a &quot;groundbreaking adventure game&quot;, and is currently in the process of transitioning from Unreal 4 to the dazzling new tech of Unreal 5.
&quot;We strongly believe in the Project Dagger&#x27;s potential and are now committed to continue its development within our self-publishing pipeline,&quot; confirms Wojciechowski. &quot;The game is still in pre-production – our team is now focusing on closing combat and game loops and migrate from UE4 to UE5. I&#x27;m conscious that this decision will add investments on us, but self-publishing is part of our strategy.&quot;
&quot;Of course, we are not ruling out working with a new publisher if this creates a compelling business opportunity.&quot;

That TV show that caused some totally normal people to smash up a Mcdonald&#x27;s is seeing new representation in Player First Games&#x27; brawler MultiVersus. Rick Sanchez, of popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty fame, is now available to purchase in-game, joining his grandson Morty, who was added to the roster back in August.
Both mad scientist and troublemaking grandpa, Sanchez will be bringing his laboratory skills to the battlefield as a Mage-class fighter. Choosing the far ground as his ideal point of attack, Sanchez utilizes a number of ranged abilities in order to work over the opposition from afar, and is even able to beat a hasty retreat thanks to his use of reality-bending teleportation portals, which operate in a similar fashion to Bugs Bunny&#x27;s tunnels.

O MGLRU jsme psali už v lednu, v červenci došlo na přehnaný optimismus o možném začlenění do jádra 5.20 (tedy 6.0), který následovaly informace o zahrnutí kódu do vetvě mm-unstable Andrewa Mortona. Zde MGLRU prodělal další ladění kvality kódu a nyní to opravdu vypadá, že začlenění je na spadnutí. Projekt se totiž přesouvá do větve  mm-stable.</span>

Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home planet to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin. As a fan of “little person in a big world” experie…</span>

                              <span>Overwatch 2 introduces a bevy of new characters, maps, and modes when it launches early next week. However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel&#x27;s new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass. The pass&#x27; free track allows players to unlock a new support character named Kiriko, while its premium track – which costs $10 or 1,000 Overwatch Coins – offers unique cyberpunk-themed cosmetics like weapon charms, souvenirs, and legendary skins. Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch&#x27;s new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins. 
We recently interviewed Overwatch 2&#x27;s leadership group to learn about their philosophy while developing the Battle Pass and Mythic Skins&#x27; role in the sequel&#x27;s revamped monetization …</span>

                              <span>At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity&#x27;s collapse a la the game&#x27;s prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what&#x27;s to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester&#x27;s impressions of that title here.</span>

                              <span>In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a &quot;world class event to serve the global gaming industry.&quot; The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea&#x27;s Game Rating committee, and it&#x27;s possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it&#x27;s unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama&#x27;s new game, Slitterhead.

                              <span>Marvel has stepped up its gaming output these past few years. Following the success of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man in 2018 by Insomniac Games, the team later announced Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, due out sometime next year. Insomniac is also working on a Wolverine game. Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it&#x27;s working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig&#x27;s new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There&#x27;s also Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year&#x27;s excellent Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
All of this is to say that Marvel has been pumping out a steady stream of games with more to come. However, despite that, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the company to create a co…</span>

                              <span>Night School Studio has delayed Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. 
Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn&#x27;t mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel &quot;truly special&quot; and to add more localizations. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s full statement on the delay:

                              <span>A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

                              <span>A great many new Cyberpunk 2077 mods are adding bits and pieces from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new ultraviolent spin-off anime series. Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

Certain Affinity exec Paul Sams made the comments in an interview with VentureBeat, adding further fuel to the rumours that a battle royale mode might be coming to the live-service game in the future. Certain Affinity have contributed to many projects in a support role, including Amazon’s New World and the upcoming Potter ‘em up Hogwarts Legacy.

The left-winger and lifelong reader of Rail magazine got his thumbs a-twiddlin’ for a special arcade version of the mod while at The World Transformed, a festival being held in Liverpool that celebrates radical politics, art, and culture. This is what he’s doing instead of singing God Save The King at the party conference then.

There hasn’t been an in-person E3 since 2019, and just one digital event bearing the E3 name has taken place since then. That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they&#x27;re this site’s parent organisation.

Taki-san&#x27;s performance as character Kyohei Hamura was removed from the Japanese version of Judgment after he was arrested for possession and use of cocaine in 2019, never making it to the West. Now, the Judgment Pierre Taki Restoration Patch finally brings the scrubbed actor back for the very first time, over here at least.

As such there are a few Phoronix articles today looking at these Zen 4 processors under Linux and many benchmarks whole several more follow-up articles will be coming over the weeks ahead. For the launch-day review I have the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X and 7950X processors. Let&#x27;s take a look at the significant performance improvements to find with the AMD Ryzen 9 7900 series under Linux.</span>

                              <span>While much of AMD&#x27;s briefings for the Ryzen 7000 desktop series were focused on gaming and other consumer workloads, one of the most exciting aspects for me with the Ryzen 7000 series is AMD now supporting AVX-512. But rather going for a 512-bit FPU data path and the possibility of reduced clock frequencies and power/thermal concerns, they employed a 256-bit &quot;double pumping&quot; strategy. When getting the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in the lab, exploring the AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 performance was one of the areas I was most excited to evaluate. From the benchmarks about to be shown, AMD&#x27;s initial AVX-512 implementation is promising and has me all the more excited for finding it on AMD EPYC &quot;Genoa&quot; processors.</span>

                              <span>The U.S. Trade Representative has started collecting input for its annual list of notorious piracy markets. In 2022, there&#x27;s a special focus on the impact of online piracy on US workers. This will likely lead to detailed reports on hundreds of thousands of estimated job losses. But will jobs created by piracy get a mention as well?

It had an ethics policy that prevented newly released content from being shared but that stood for nothing when the owner&#x27;s home was raided in 2018. Despite the site closing down in 2019, legal action continued for another three years as copyright holders attempted to take down a solitary remaining hyperlink.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don&#x27;t usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it&#x27;s a fun silly idea; 2) it&#x27;s very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It&#x27;s a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn&#x27;t frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted that a source has told him that the teenager’s detainment was related to the Rockstar hack and another involving Uber. Keys claimed that the suspect is connected to hacking group Lapsus$, which organises through Telegram channels.

                              <span>Steam now has a fancy charts section that shows the top selling and most played games in real time. If you want a broader picture of what’s trending on Valve’s storefront then you can check out the new weekly rankings of top sellers, along with the top new releases each month. It’s a useful way of seeing what’s trending across the platform if you’re really into that kind of thing.

                              <span>Sega’s team-based space shooter Hyenas is welcoming Europeans into its closed alpha from September 23rd, which just so happens to be today. If you signed up to the alpha anytime in the past few months since the game was announced then you might want to keep an eye on your emails for an invite. The FPS is currently only playable on PC, but the Hyenas team have said that’s set to change in the near future.

                              <span>The remake of classic stealth ‘em up Splinter Cell will be rewritten and updated for a “modern-day audience”, according to a job posting for the project. Ubisoft Toronto are looking for a scriptwriter for the new Splinter Cell, which they say uses the original as a “foundation” and aims at a “new audience of Splinter Cell fans”. I hate to break it to you Ubisoft, but I’m not certain that the kids dig Tom Clancy military espionage hijinks.

My money’s on Rick And Morty’s Rick Sanchez, but Stripe from Gremlins and the DC Universe’s Black Adam are still set to arrive too. You’ll have to wait until 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST to find out who the next fighter is, according to a tweet from the MultiVersus team.

Kindly, they&#x27;re going to check in across the day, texting us all with updates on what they&#x27;re seeing, doing, and (I imagine) eating. And Ollie might join in from home with cat photos.

                              <span>After a copyright blunder led to a major boost for the horror genre, George A. Romero&#x27;s Night of the Living Dead became a public domain classic. But in a terrifying new twist, YouTubers are now completely surrounded by a horde of Content ID notices claiming ownership and monetization rights. Screams for help are being ignored as Universal Music-owned Ingrooves gorges on the spoils.

Research by Parks Associates reveals that this percentage has increased significantly in recent years. According to some experts and insiders, this can in part be explained by the fragmented streaming landscape.

                              <span>Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. film will get its first teaser trailer next month. It also has a new premiere date for the movie following its delay in April. 
The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won&#x27;t have an Italian accent.</span>

                              <span>The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team&#x27;s play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it&#x27;s clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet&#x27;s original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

                              <span>Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a &#x27;lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

                              <span>Nvidia stuck to the high-end goods for their GeForce RTX 40 series announcement, revealing their next graphics card generation with only the premier RTX 4090 and two flavours of RTX 4080. All three are coming soon with varying degrees of price bumps over the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, though Nvidia reckon the performance and feature improvements of the 40 series’ Ada Lovelace architecture will make them worthy investments. Especially with the aid of DLSS 3, a new and significantly upgraded version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler that will only work with RTX 40 series GPUs at launch.

CD Projekt have revealed in a tweet that the game has seen one million players every day this week so far, across all platforms. They say this figure includes players new to Night City, as well as those returning. I’ve never played it, so don’t look at me.

Oh, and they&#x27;re cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.

Maybe it’s the selection of classic bangers such as Old Grey Mare and Take Me Out To The Ballgame, or perhaps it&#x27;s the constant prompts of NASTY and PERFECTO, but devs Holy Wow seem to be on to a winner. If you haven’t already witnessed the game in action then please do yourself a favour and watch the trailer below.

FromSoftware confirmed that PvP multiplayer for the Steam version of the game had gone offline in a tweet, and said they’d provide an update once details were available to share. When I published this post, no explanation was forthcoming about what the cause of the downtime might be.

                              <span>Have you ever played a game and thought, &quot;Are we actually the bad guys here?&quot; Usually, the whole &quot;we&#x27;re fighting on the wrong side of history&quot; line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you&#x27;ve achieved so far. I don&#x27;t say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you&#x27;re looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there&#x27;s an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they&#x27;re, err, pro democracy. Of the cast&#x27;s central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he&#x27;s repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, &quot;Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.&quot; It&#x27;s an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

The developer&#x27;s claims include copyright infringement, but nothing in its complaint is going unchallenged. It transpires that Bungie&#x27;s target is a teenager, one that in typical fashion has an answer for everything, with help from his lawyer, of course.

                              <span>The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team&#x27;s biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors&#x27; likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t indicated if we&#x27;ll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent&#x27;s signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent&#x27;s chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond&#x27;s home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club&#x27;s manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.</span>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that impossible geometry is better than games playing the music CD left in your drive. As someone definitely not attempting to rig the vote, I respect people on both sides yet am pleased by this outcome. This week, ah sure, why not have another crack at pitting two similar-ish things against each other. It feels against the spirit of the competition but I&#x27;m curious. Let&#x27;s try two sounds. What&#x27;s better: ding! or the Howie scream?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover &#x27;charms&#x27;. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it&#x27;s something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

Creator Derek Yu said that more updates are planned for Spelunky 2, but the next step is to get feedback on multiplayer to improve the experience now its basic features are there. Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

The hacker then fired off a message to some accounts that contained a malicious link.

                              <span>The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon&#x27;s Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon&#x27;s trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here&#x27;s the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That&#x27;s how it feels to play, too.

                              <span>Of all the games I sampled at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, Scorn surprised me the most. For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.

If you’re easily spooked like me then you’ll need to pester a friend or family member to play along with you, as one person plays in the past while the other plays in the future. Watch the trailer below, and stop checking your shadow.

This is not the case. Developers know that, so some have shared early footage of well-known games that you and I have most likely played in a very different form.

                              <span>As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

Today, Marvel Games and Motive Studios have revealed they’re working together on a new game starring the armoured Avenger. Marvel announced the project with a single shadowy image of Iron Man and his shiny gamer highlights on Twitter. They described the game as an “all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure title”. The dev team is being led by Olivier Proulx, who previously worked on Eidos-Montréal’s Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy. Motive are known for 2020’s Star Wars: Squadrons and the upcoming Dead Space remake.

Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate. The head of series developers Ryu Ga Gotoku, Masayoshi Yokoyama, has since confirmed the change in a recent interview (thanks IGN).

                              <span>For what is now the fifth time in a row, Valve have announced that waiting Steam Deck reservation holders will get their SteamOS handheld earlier than anticipated. That’s thanks to yet another uptick in production speed, according to a Steam Community post, so everyone whose delivery estimate was in Q3 2022 should now have received their confirmation email. Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

Paradox have added a new difficulty setting aimed at easing in new players aboard Stellaris’ long-running interstellar skiff, along with some new adjustments they’re hoping will challenge more experienced players. The update also rebalances relics, improves UI and AI, and brings back Culture Workers.

Well, that’s exactly what’s happened for some of us today. Hyper Demon seems to be all about the disembodied, infernal craniums too, but don’t call it a sequel. Brace yourself as you watch the nightmarish trailer below. It&#x27;s a wild one.

What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

It’s also emerged that the same hacker may have been responsible for a breach of rideshare platform Uber last week. Uber say they’re in contact with both the FBI and the U.S. Department Of Justice over the hacks.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog brand&#x27;s expansion throughout multimedia has given fans plenty to enjoy in recent years. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn&#x27;t show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it&#x27;s bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.</span>

The as-of-yet untitled game is a single-player, third-person, action title starring everyone&#x27;s favorite genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist: Tony Stark. Electronic Arts heralds this game as the first of several new games developed in a new collaboration with Marvel.
According to the announcement, Motive Studio hopes to tap into the rich history of Iron Man and Tony Stark. The studio hopes to channel &quot;the complexity, charisma, and creative genius of Tony Stark, enabling players to feel what it&#x27;s like to truly play as Iron Man.&quot;

                              <span>To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won&#x27;t be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

                              <span>The RTX 4090 is all but confirmed now, based on the sheer volume of leaks, rumours and speculation showing off the next-gen Nvidia GPU in a variety of guises but sharing the same specs. That&#x27;s pushed the prices of current-gen GPUs way down, and that&#x27;s especially true for high-end cards. Ergo, it&#x27;s not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green&#x27;s flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

                              <span>EVGA may be getting out of the graphics card business, but they&#x27;re still one of the premiere brands for high-quality power supplies. One massive 1600W 80+ Platinum unit has been highly discounted over in the States, where the EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ is down to $200 from its original price of $500. That&#x27;s an awesome deal on a power supply ideally suited for high-end, multiple-GPU systems - and doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a Platinum-rated 1000W PSU.

                              <span>A huge number of videos purporting to show in-game development footage for GTA 6 have been plastered across various internet forums this morning, because apparently no one can wait until a video game is actually anywhere near finished before they feel compelled to spoil it for all and sundry. 
The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won&#x27;t find a link to them here, because the truth is, they&#x27;re simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn&#x27;t going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it&#x27;s actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

I may enjoy it even more in future, since its developers announced that they&#x27;re going to support music modding soon.

                              <span>Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game&#x27;s upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she&#x27;s all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It&#x27;s not yet clear what role Lady D&#x27;s castle has to play in Rose&#x27;s journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren&#x27;t for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it&#x27;s on my shoes. Great. And the gate&#x27;s locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

                              <span>Here we are, the final weekend of summer! I feel I wasted this summer a bit and as much as I do like autumn, I really am not ready for the winter which will follow. Why do I always let my holiday days slide down and clump at the end of the year. Better make the most of comfortable swimming and cycling while I still can.
We&#x27;re away on Monday so we&#x27;ll see you again on Tuesday. Until then, what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show is in full swing, especially now that the general public has invaded the Makuhari Messe convention center this weekend. Blake Hester and I have been touring the show floor, checking out games, and taking plenty of pictures. We shared our first batch of TGS photos yesterday (check them out here) and have even more images to help make you feel as close to the event without being here as possible.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of this week&#x27;s announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …</span>

                              <span>Logitech&#x27;s G29 racing wheel and pedals is down to $230 at Amazon, offering a great chance to pick up a highly-regarded budget wheel at a fair price. 
The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There&#x27;s also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that&#x27;s available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That&#x27;s more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you&#x27;re getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show provided an opportunity to try out the latest build of Street Fighter 6. Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic. She’s also set to play a pivotal role in t…</span>

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying.

                              <span>I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…</span>

                              <span>Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won&#x27;t tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we&#x27;re getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it&#x27;s E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there&#x27;s some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you&#x27;ve never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we&#x27;d love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!</span>

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that it will hold a Resident Evil-focused showcase in October, presumably to discuss both Resident Evil Village&#x27;s upcoming DLC, The Winters&#x27; Expansion, which comes out next month, and Resident Evil 4 Remake. And speaking of Resident Evil 4 Remake, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed during Tokyo Game Show that the remake will also be coming to PlayStation 4, as reported by GameSpot. 
When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Now the company has confirmed that the game will be available on PS4 when it launches on March 24, 2023. There&#x27;s no word if Resident Evil 4 Remake will come to Xb…</span>

                              <span>Konami has revealed Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here&#x27;s hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game&#x27;s Steam page:

During today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That&#x27;s when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that&#x27;s all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


&quot;[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game&#x27;s four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.&quot;
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

                              <span>Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass&#x27; free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko&#x27;s Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they&#x27;re mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that&#x27;s faster and stronger. And sure enough, that&#x27;s exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; marketing thus far. It&#x27;s also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they&#x27;re out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties&#x27; inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it&#x27;s remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new &quot;Ambush&quot; trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it&#x27;s looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game&#x27;s announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu&#x27;s life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he&#x27;s seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp.

                              <span>The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it&#x27;s called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he&#x27;s back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it&#x27;s Hero time – remember, he&#x27;s a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.</span>

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>
