Next week sees the release of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak - the new DLC for Capcom&#x27;s latest Monster Hunter entry.
We&#x27;ve already seen (and played) some of this new DLC, but Capcom is still finding some new things to show off ahead of Sunbreak&#x27;s release on 30th June. This time we&#x27;ve got a look at the &quot;additional camera features&quot; that have been added in.

It&#x27;s an incredibly busy week for the Switch with the release of titles like Fall Guys, Roller Champions and Sonic Origins. Alongside all of these games we&#x27;ve also got the first-party title Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes.
This is another spectacular Musou game by the team at Omega Force that sees you (the player) take control of the brand new character Shez, as they prepare to face off against the Three Houses protagonist Byleth. From here you join forces with Edelgard, Dimitri and Claude and are invited to set off on an all-new adventure.

IGN&#x27;s &#x27;Summer of Gaming&#x27; continues tomorrow and apparently an exciting &quot;world premiere exclusive&quot; will be presented by Sega.
In a teaser video, all there is an odd sound clip that lasts for about eight seconds. Some are saying it kind of sounds like a Dolphin... leading to calls for Ecco the Dolphin to return, but we&#x27;ll try not to speculate here as it could be for anything.

Last week, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made a return in their new video game outing Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. While most players are probably having a blast in the game, there have been a small number of issues popping up here and there.
Dotemu and Tribute Games appear to have the situation under control - rolling out a new patch that addresses some of the issues reported by players so far. Once again, it&#x27;s all minor stuff, but if you haven&#x27;t already booted up the game, be ready to install Version 1.0.2 next time you launch it on your Nintendo Switch.

The Ghostbusters are back in town and will soon light up specters in a new asymmetrical multiplayer game from IllFonic, the development studio behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds. In an exclusive new look at the studio&#x27;s forthcoming Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, we see four proton packs charge up and ignite against a purple Slimer-like ghost with far too many eyes. This battle unfolds within a prison setting that IlllFonic felt was a must for this game.

It&#x27;s wild to think that we were talking about Junker Queen in the original Overwatch five years ago — where has the time gone? With the sequel coming into focus and trying its best to justify itself (now as a free-to-play, battle-pass-powered game), the long-time-coming tank hero has stepped &quot;out of the lore and into the light,&quot; as Blizzard puts it.
&quot;Tanks play more aggressively in Overwatch 2,&quot; and as one of the first new characters for the game&#x27;s Season 1 launch, Junker Queen has to exemplify that shift. Players can charge into battle, wound their opponents, and stay in the fight with a life-leech passive.

Insane, custom gaming builds are a favorite of the internet, hence why they tend to go viral pretty much every time. A new project has been making the rounds on Reddit, and it&#x27;s one of the coolest builds I&#x27;ve seen in a long time: a giant working Xbox Series X. According to his YouTube channel, a user called PhantomSpectre, or Michael Pick, was inspired after seeing the Xbox Series X refrigerator (and subsequent mini-fridge) that was created by Microsoft back in 2020 as a response to comments online that the new console was built like a fridge.
While that refrigerator was indeed running (and then spawned a series of lackluster mini fridges that also looked like the Series X), Pick thought it would be cool to have a console that big that actually worked as a console. The bu…</span>

                              <span>I am continually on the lookout for the next management game to obsess me, and Good Company looks like a good candidate. It&#x27;s a tycoon factory builder about forming a technology company and leading it, from product design through hiring staff and all the way to replacing those staff with robots. It looks cute and, as of its departure from Steam Early Access today, robust.

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It&#x27;s not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

                              <span>I love the name &quot;SpellForce&quot;, mid-word capital letter and all. It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

                              <span>Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

                              <span>So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

                              <span>Last time I played Raft, it was a small but solid survival game about hauling rubbish from the ocean to expand your little slab of planks into a roaming home and farm while fending off hungry sharks. That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified &quot;violation of related laws and regulations&quot;.

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

It doesn&#x27;t look quite as cool as a Razer Blade or as beautifully thick as an XMG Apex 15, but it&#x27;s got it where it counts: inside. Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP.

                              <span>Big enough for the whole Bat Family
WB Montreal&#x27;s Gotham Knights is sounding like a pretty big game. Or at least big in square mileage, when it comes to the city of Gotham.
In an interview with Game Informer, Gotham Knights game director Geoff Ellenor emphasizes the Batcycle&#x27;s usefulness for getting around Gotham.
&quot;It&#x27;s pretty big. I haven’t put one map over the other, but our Gotham is a big place. I tend to spend a lot of my Zoom calls on the Batcyle driving around Gotham. It is one of the fastest and most chill ways to move around the city. It feels like a big place.&quot;
Gotham Knights executive producer Fleur Marty follows it up with a more direct comparison to how big this portrayal of Batman&#x27;s home will be.
&quot;For sure it’s the biggest version of Gotham that has been represented in video games,&quot; said Fleur. &quot;The most important thing for us is its density and verticality. It has a lot of layers. The Batcycle is the long-range mode of transportation.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sFtYcS3DPfM
Knight court
That&#x27;s a big Gotham then, if we&#x27;re comparing it to the likes of Arkham Knight. Good to know the Batfamily may have lost Bruce but kept some wheels around.
As for other tidbits from Game Informer&#x27;s coverage, the pair also addresses what happens when two players pick the same character. It sounds like it&#x27;s not only possible, but has some funny ramifications.
&quot;We’re leaving it up to players.,&quot; said Fleur. &quot;We know some people will want to have different characters, but some won’t care. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there’s a funny moment in the game if you are playing as two of the same character.&quot;
I&#x27;m hoping for a &quot;two Robins walk into a bar&quot; joke somewhere. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on Oct. 25, 2022.

                              <span>Gaara and more join the battle royale
This week, Fortnite gets even more Naruto characters in the mix. Four more characters from the manga and anime series are dropping into Fortnite&#x27;s Item Shop on June 23, this Thursday.
The four candidates chosen this time around are some recognizable faces, even if you&#x27;re not too familiar with Naruto. Itachi Uchiha and Orochimaru bring some menacing presence to the field, while Gaara is the rival-turned-ally of the group. Also joining the crew is Hinata, a Hyuga clan Shinobi who grows close to the cast, especially Naruto.
Add these to the already added Naruto characters in Fortnite, like Sasuke and the titular shinobi, and you&#x27;ve got a lot of options for fans of the ninja-themed series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;np7xNgjFqdw
Alongside the skins themselves, there are also a bunch of backpacks, gliders, and emotes to pick up as part of this &quot;Rivals&quot; drop. There are bundles too, packing together some of the characters, cosmetics, and some loading screens as well. You can find the full rundown here.
Return to the village
Additionally, from 8 p.m. ET on June 23 to 8 p.m. ET on July 7, the gates to the Hidden Leaf Village Map will open up again. The adventure area has plenty of locations to explore, as well as quests to complete and unlock more areas. Nindo Community Challenges are also back, oepning up today to earn some cosmetic rewards.
Now, I&#x27;m not the biggest Naruto fan, so these admittedly do little for me. But if I may still make a humble request: if we&#x27;re going to keep adding Naruto characters to Fortnite, Rock Lee needs to be in the picture.

Expansive Worlds is building upon its successful hunting sim theHunter: Call of the Wild with a new open-world fishing game later this year, and while solitude can really fit the serene side of this hobby, sometimes, it&#x27;s just plain better with friends. In the upcoming PC and console game Call of the Wild: The Angler, you&#x27;ll be able to fish with 11 other players in online co-op, which sounds all sorts of cozy.

&quot;Call of the Wild: The Angler represents a new vision from our team that goes beyond what you’d expect from a fishing game in a lot of fun ways,&quot; said game director said Paul Rustchynsky. &quot;Whether you love the thrill of the sport or the quiet joy of explor…</span>

                              <span>Art exhibition coming to Tokyo this summer
This year sees the 20th anniversary of the cult JRPG franchise .hack//. To celebrate two decades of dystopian sci-fi action, publisher Bandai Namco has announced several different endeavors that will look back at the video games, manga, anime, and novels set within CyberConnect2&#x27;s new millennium.
The original run of the .hack manga has been digitally republished and is available for Japanese fans to purchase between now and July 4 directly from the CyberConnect2 website. In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release .hack//Infection through collectible card title .hack//Enemy. Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9ulUhubUdYc
A special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of .hack&#x27;s evocative and melodramatic score.
But what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the &quot;Last Recollection&quot; trademark, which the publisher filed back in April of this year. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and finally .hack//Quarantine. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.

                              <span>Choose Your Fighter
It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but we are now one week away from the launch of Nexon&#x27;s cool-looking fighter, DNF Duel. Y&#x27;all excited? I know I am, just for the roster at the very least. The publisher has chosen to stoke the hype fire one last time by releasing the game&#x27;s opening cinematic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ruRh8RGLRVM
Originally announced in 2019, (and widely covered by yer boy since), DNF Duel is a one-on-one fighter adapted from the popular Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online. DNF Duel repurposes an arsenal of DFO classes as individual roster members, including Fighter, Grappler, Inquisitor, Dragon Knight, Kunoichi, and many others. With gameplay designed by Guilty Gear&#x27;s Arc System Works, and some very impressive visuals, DNF Duel is looking to make an impact in the coming FGC summer season.
DNF Duel will feature rollback netcode on PS4 and PC, though will sadly not support crossplay, at least not at launch. In addition to online battles, the fighter will include a single-player story mode, training facilities, survival mode, a gallery, and more. There is no denying that it is an unknown IP in the fighting game world, and is up against stiff competition from current and upcoming games. But it looks like Nexon&#x27;s underdog hopes to come out swingin&#x27; and carve a niche all of its very own.
DNF Duel will launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28. Be sure to check out the dynamic character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.

                              <span>Falling, free falling
The frenetic platformer royale Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout goes free-to-play and adds some new platforms today. The Free For All season is live now, and Fall Guys is officially launched for Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.
News of this update arrived last month, revealing Mediatonic&#x27;s gameshow-style competition is coming to new platforms. With today&#x27;s update, Fall Guys is now free to play on all platforms. It also has cross-play across all platforms, so the party doesn&#x27;t stop when you swap over. Mediatonic also confirms in an FAQ that the new season makes Fall Guys cross-progression as well.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1539235705460776962
Today&#x27;s update also marks the launch of the new Season Pass. Everyone gets access to 50 levels, while legacy players—those who bought Fall Guys when it first launched—get the whole thing free.
Grab a hold of the ledge
Some more updates are in store for Fall Guys today as well. Alongside the new cosmetics in the Season Pass, some new courses are being added. Hex-A-Ring, Volleyfall, Speed Circuit, Track Attack, Bounce Party, The Swiveller, and Blast Ball are all added in to the game.
An Auto Grab option is also available, letting players automatically grab ledges. You can also now dive-grab Tails and Crowns, which is sure to make some of those protect-your-tail rounds more interesting. Voice Chat is also enabled in Parties.
One note is that while Steam owners will continue to be able to play Fall Guys and get all the updates, the platformer royale won&#x27;t have a Steam store page anymore. Any new players picking up Fall Guys on PC today will need to play through the Epic Games Store.
With all the new cosmetics and courses, as well as cross-platform play, it really does seem like a good summer to get back into Fall Guys. Time to get my hot-dog suit out of the closet and chase some Crowns.

                              <span>It&#x27;s out on Steam on June 23
A Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands Steam release is imminent as Gearbox has just revealed that the game is coming to the platform on June 23. That&#x27;s this week!
Originally released on March 25, 2022, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands came out on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and...PC, but only on the Epic Games Store. While many games have longer exclusivity windows, Wonderlands will hit Steam in less than three months, which isn&#x27;t bad in the grand scheme of things. Gearbox has announced that the exact release time for Wonderlands Steam is actually 10AM PT on June 23. It&#x27;ll debut with a standard edition for $60, or the special [Chaotic Great] edition for $79.99 (which includes the season pass) — if you buy in on Steam through July 7, 2022, you&#x27;ll get the golden hero armor pack.
So, a few quick things about the Wonderlands Steam edition. Gearbox says that save data can be transferred between Steam and Epic, &quot;but will need to be moved manually.&quot; Annoyingly, the publisher says that &quot;players run the risk of potentially losing save files,&quot; and suggests that users &quot;make a backup copy.&quot; This kind of goes without saying, but it&#x27;s good to reiterate every now and then. The Steam version will also support cross-play, and will not be left out of that party. Oh, and the Molten Mirrors DLC is out this week, which will be live alongside of the Steam edition. It&#x27;s the third (of four) &quot;Mirrors of Mystery&quot; DLC packs, which comprise the season pass.
You can find the Steam page for the game here. Again, it&#x27;ll be live on June 23 at 10AM PT.

Modder CraftyBoss managed to do something that probably should have been done a long time ago: a Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod.
Housed on their Discord server, the mod (which requires a modded Switch) allows up to 10 people to play Mario Odyssey together, with different costumes to differentiate everyone: that actually sync while playing. The mod itself is a work in progress, as is the custom game mode concept, but for now, the basics seem to be working.
Interestingly, moon collection (collectibles that dictate game progress) &quot;is shared between all players.&quot; Meaning, you could have an entire crew jump into a level, and either play it separately to divide and conquer, or hang out together and go for the same objective. It reminds me of Castlevania: Harmony of Despair&#x27;s core gimmick (man that game needs to come back on modern platforms!).
While Mario Odyssey felt more than complete on its own, something like this, even if it was just a few players at a time, gives it new life. &quot;What if [X] had multiplayer&quot; is something people have been pondering for decades in the realm of gaming, and mods have typically been the way to deliver on that dream.

                              <span>Legendary studio has something in store
Treasure, the acclaimed studio behind such franchises as Gunstar Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Bangai-O, and Ikaruga, has announced that it is currently hard at work on a mysterious new game, which it hopes to announce later in 2022 as part of the developer&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebrations.
While the studio — which was originally founded in 1992 by ex-Konami coder Masato Maegawa — has offered no direct information in regards to the new game&#x27;s IP, form, or genre, Treasure has noted that the project is something that its fans have been requesting for quite some time, which has got the company&#x27;s dedicated, long-time fanbase buzzing with excitement and intrigue.
https://twitter.com/TreasureCoLtd/status/1538446520977985536?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;9OJMkYLupw94PAZdA8yaxw
&quot;On June 19, 2022, Treasure celebrated its 30th anniversary!&quot; wrote the developer on its official Twitter. &quot;On this 30th anniversary year, we are working hard in development to announce the highly requested &#x27;that&#x27;. Please continue to give Treasure your support going forward.&quot;
While the tweet makes it sound like the title will be a known entity, such as a sequel or remake, that still leaves a whole lot of mystery up in the air. After all, Treasure&#x27;s catalog of franchises are all incredibly popular, and fans would be pleased with a sequel to any of the aforementioned games. Of course, we could simply be looking at a major remaster or remake of one of its enduring classics — Ikaruga for example — but frankly, at this stage, I think the fans are just happy to see the studio back at it.
Let the speculation commence. We&#x27;ll be sure to give you the good word when Treasure shows its hand.

                              <span>For cloud, console, and PC
Microsoft has just revealed this morning that a Far Cry 5 Game Pass release is on the horizon. It&#x27;s not one of those let-down &quot;oh it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass, but cloud only&quot; (cue Microsoft exec laughs) deals either. It&#x27;s hitting Xbox Game Pass on July 1 on everything: cloud, console, and PC.
It&#x27;s not alone, either. The Shadowrun Trilogy is set to debut on Xbox Game Pass today, on both cloud devices and consoles. It&#x27;s significant in that it&#x27;s actually three games: Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director&#x27;s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. The rest of the week is rounded out by Total War: Three Kingdoms, FIFA 22, and Naraka: Bladepoint. As usual, Game Pass is getting down with a degree of variety with its offerings: tactical RPGs, sports, and AAA shooters. Not bad!
Microsoft also reminds folks that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge recently came out on Game Pass, which is perfect for the service for those who are on the fence about a beat &#x27;em up.
Xbox Game Pass week of June 20:
Shadowrun Trilogy, June 21 (Cloud and Console)
Total War: Three Kingdoms, June 21 (PC)
FIFA 22, June 23 (Console and PC)
Naraka: Bladepoint, June 23 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Xbox Game Pass week of June 27:
Far Cry 5, July 1 (Cloud, Console, and PC)

I try not to have opinions about the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It’s dangerous. What’s wrong with the series? Why does it have such a ravenous fanbase? What games are good? Which ones are bad?
Well, we certainly go back to the Sega Genesis titles a lot, which is what Sonic Origins is. I’m pretty sure I’ve accidentally bought Sonic the Hedgehog more times than I’ve intentionally bought any other game. Sonic Origins promises to be more of a remaster, but that&#x27;s a weird way to use that word. It’s widescreen now. I guess that’s something.

When we last left Fire Emblem Warriors, it was but the learner. Now, with Three Hopes, it is the master.

Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (Nintendo Switch)

My review process with Three Hopes was a bit of a rollercoaster.
At first, I was worried. Some of the more rote elements of the Warriors formula shined through the brightest at the start, and during the prologue, before most of the systems come into play, it wasn&#x27;t grabbing me as much as I&#x27;d hoped. But then another five foundational mechanics came into play. And another five. And...you get the picture. A few chapters in, the game really starts to take shape, and I was hooked.
Three Hopes kinda never stops throwing stuff at you, which is going to appeal to a certain kind of person and scare others away (namely fo…</span>

Fans of SNK&#x27;s foremost fight franchise The King of Fighters are waking up to some surprising and unexpected news this morning, as it appears that The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Match Final Edition is now available to purchase on PS4, mere hours after it popped up on the PEGI ratings board.
Already available on PC via Steam and GOG.com, The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Match Final Edition is (allegedly) the last revision of the classic KoF entry, still considered by many to be the most iconic and definitive release in the storied series. KoF &#x27;98 Final Edition, originally released in 2014, features a fresh rebalance of the game&#x27;s 64-strong roster of classic characters, along with rollback-netcode-powered online play, and a selection of additional modes including Endless, Mission, and Training.

In addition, boutique publisher Pix&#x27;n Love has announced that it will open pre-orders on a selection of physical releases next Monday. Options available will include a standard boxed edition of King of Fighters &#x27;98 Final Edition on PS4, a Collector&#x27;s Edition (limited to 2500 copies) with classic Neo Geo-style packaging, and finally, a Deluxe Edition (limited to 200 copies) that also includes an aluminum plate featuring a reproduction of the KoF &#x27;98 Final Edition artwork.
All physical releases will launch later in 2022, but if you want in on the limited editions, but sure to put down your pre-order, exclusively on the Pix&#x27;n Love store, on Monday, June 27, at 08:00 PT/ 11:00 ET /16:00 BST.
The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Match Final Edition is available to download now on PS4 and PC.

Skateboarding extraordinaire and world&#x27;s most familiar man Tony Hawk has noted that a &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 + 4&quot; remake was on deck, but was ultimately canned when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard.
As you&#x27;ll recall, in 2020 Vicarious released its critically acclaimed Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2, rebuilding the two classic PlayStation titles from the ground up while maintaining 1:1 gameplay to the legendary original releases. The remake would go on to become the fast-selling entry in franchise history, raking in a million sales in just its first week of release. Naturally, this led fans to hope that both Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 and Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4 would receive similar attention in the near future.

The sequel to the vastly underrated AI: The Somnium Files is almost here, and with it comes a little more information on what to expect. We&#x27;ve already seen some of the new Somnium psyncing features, the cast members, and we spoke to the game director himself to find out more about the returning characters, the developing story, and the new mechanics in the game, and now we have even more teaser info.
Ahead of the release on June 24th, developer Spike Chunsoft has revealed more extras included in nirvanA Initiative: Eyeballie, and the bonus content &quot;Tama&#x27;s Room&quot; and &quot;Aiba&#x27;s Room&quot;.

&quot;What&#x27;s in a name?&quot; Shakespeare once wrote. &quot;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot; He was, of course, talking about the blood feud between two warring families, and the thirteen-year-old daughter of the Capulet family wishing that her crush could be called something other than Montague so she can smooch him in the open.
He probably wasn&#x27;t also referring to the somewhat common (and slightly annoying) practice in games of describing a video game by comparing it to another game, since video games weren&#x27;t even invented until a few years after his death. This practice is frowned upon by many readers, and some journalists, too, and yet we persist in calling games &quot;Stardew-likes&quot;, or writing about a new game by calling it a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to some other game that everyone knows.

AK-xolotl, as the name implies, is about an axolotl, and an AK. That&#x27;s a type of gun. It&#x27;s a rather adorable top-down roguelike in which one grumpy axolotl goes on a rampage to find food to feed themselves and their babies, and thanks to its successful Kickstarter, it&#x27;ll be coming to Nintendo Switch!
The roguelike aspect is where it gets interesting, of course: You&#x27;ll be taking care of baby axolotls, which grow up into playable axolotls, which means that you can customise their traits and weapons as they grow. Plus, you can use the spoils of your runs to cook meals which unlock permanent upgrades to your little family, which includes... HATS.

Sonic the Hedgehog fans have had plenty to talk about of late. The staggered gameplay reveals and initial reactions to Sonic Frontiers have been one of the big talking points throughout this not-E3 2022 period, but we&#x27;ve also had the impending release of Sonic Origins to look forward to. While the former game looks to be taking the blue one quite literally into fresh 3D frontiers, Origins is a compilation of Sonic&#x27;s 2D 16-bit hits that has fans from the Mega Drive days eager to revisit the classic zones and characters that made us fall in love with the series in the first place.
Reviews from other platforms are in (and we&#x27;ll be working to deliver ours as soon as Switch code is available), and it seems that critical reaction to this Sonic collection is pretty positive; reassuring news for fans of these classic 2D platformers.

But today, Super Mario Wiki shared some interesting information that highlights that the job might have started taking its toll on the Whomp for quite a while now.

Sega&#x27;s compilation of all four classic Mega Drive/Genesis titles — Sonic Origins — arrives this Thursday on Switch (and other platforms!), and the reviews have been coming in as fast as the blue blur himself.
This collection sees Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD all grouped together with a plethora of modes to appeal to newcomers, classic Sonic fans, and, well, basically anyone who wants to revisit or check out the hedgehog&#x27;s history. Players will be able to speed through in Classic Mode, which presents the games in the original 4:3 format, while Anniversary Mode brings widescreen, the drop dash, and removes lives, to the classic quadrilogy. There&#x27;s also a Sonic-exclusive Story Mode, Boss Rush, a museum, and more.

Back when the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis was first released, it came with a 3-button pad which – in 1988 – felt like the future. It wasn&#x27;t square and boxy like the NES and Master System controllers but had a rounded, ergonomic shape which was more comfortable to hold, and it had one extra action button. Bliss!
However, by the time the SNES arrived, it was clear that Sega&#x27;s pad was no longer the cutting edge; with just 3 action buttons, it couldn&#x27;t offer the same degree of control options, and when Street Fighter II hit the market and changed things forever, Sega had to release a separate pad which had the required number of buttons for the game. That pad was also smaller and boasted an improved D-Pad, and it&#x27;s the design that Sega has stuck with over the decades (although the Genesis Mini was bundled with the 3-button controller in North America and Europe – Japan got the 6-button variant instead).

                              <span>Run down.
Harebrained Schemes&#x27; superlative Shadowrun Trilogy first released back in 2013 after a successful Kickstarter campaign that saw its intriguing cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world drop onto PC and mobile devices. Set in the same universe as the long-running Shadowrun tabletop RPG series, this is a trio of games that take place in a delightfully atmospheric near-future world where elves, orcs, dwarves and humans live side by side in a complex and troubled society.
The first entry in the series, Shadowrun Returns, wastes no time in blasting you through its simple character creation suite before plonking you down onto the rain-soaked streets of 2054 Seattle where you&#x27;ll indulge in lots of well-written conversations with a cast of interesting NPCs whilst engaging in delightfully breezy XCOM-lite style battles. Yes, that&#x27;s right, breezy. One of the main draws of Shadowrun Returns, and one of its biggest surprises given the genre, is this quick and easy breeziness that filters through every aspect of how it conducts itself. It gets to the point quickly, funnels you through its linear story and world without wasting a second of your time, makes upgrading and purchasing gear a doddle, and the whole thing is done and dusted in around about ten hours.

Sonic Origins is just around the corner, launching on Switch on this coming Thursday. It&#x27;s no secret at this point that the music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was likely to be altered for the new release, owing to complications with the rights, and now we&#x27;ve got confirmation that this is indeed the case.
It&#x27;s sad that we have to report this, but it looks like classic tracks from the original release, such as Carnival Night Zone and Ice Cap Zone, have been completely replaced in Sonic Origins. As explained in the below video from GameXplain, it looks like the tracks have been replaced by revamped versions of the &#x27;90s music from the prototype release of Sonic 3, so it&#x27;s not a total bummer.

                              <span>It’s a Graveyard Smash.
Capcom was a king of the nascent arcade industry back in the 1980s. An innovator, a game-changer, its invention within the fighting game genre remains unsurpassed. The company isn&#x27;t new to releasing retro collections, with close to thirty compilations across various platforms. With newer hardware, however, there’s a more reliable chance that arcade games will be accurately preserved, and in a more streamlined format. Essentially, this is exactly what Capcom Fighting Collection offers.
Be aware, though, that the featured titles are strictly arcade-only, meaning Donovan’s corrupt alter-ego from Vampire Savior (PlayStation and PSP compilations), three rather excellent console-exclusive characters from Cyberbots (Sega Saturn/PlayStation) and three appearances unique to console releases of Super Puzzle Fighter II X aren’t present.

After spending some time in Steam&#x27;s Early Access program, publisher tinyBuild has announced that Despot&#x27;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder will launch on the Switch this Summer.
Featuring stylised pixelated visuals, the game sees you in command of a army of &quot;puny humans&quot; as you work to build them into the most formidable force possible. You&#x27;ll have access to over 50 weapon types, including conventional swords, stale pretzel throwers, and refrigerators.

With the success of the likes of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Persona 5 Strikers and, of course, 2017&#x27;s Fire Emblem Warriors on Nintendo Switch, it should come as absolutely no surprise to anyone that Omega Force, the developer behind the long-running Warriors franchise, is intent on continuing to serve up more zany crossovers that mix its spectacular Musou mayhem with aspects of whichever series it happens to be teaming up with this time around.
The first Fire Emblem Warriors was a mostly successful melding of Warrior&#x27;s signature mass brawls and the relationship-building and strategy elements for which Intelligent Systems&#x27; tactical RPGs are best known. Now, some five years later, we&#x27;re being treated to a follow-up that takes the entire cast of the hugely popular Fire Emblem: Three Houses and flings them headlong into hack-and-slash battle. Is it mostly more of the same? Well, yes — Musou gonna Musou — but crucially this second bite at the cherry fixes the first game&#x27;s biggest flaw by providing a twisting, turning narrative that&#x27;s a huge improvement over the serviceable but uninspired story delivered in 2017.

                              <span>Our best look at a &quot;realistic&quot; Samus.
We&#x27;ve seen plenty of fan art for the Metroid franchise over the years, including some absolutely stunning cosplay creations just a few weeks back. The latest to grace the internet is courtesy of Luis Nieves, who works as a senior character artist at Xbox studio &#x27;The Initiative&#x27;, presumably plugging away at the reboot of the Perfect Dark series.
Luis&#x27;s artwork depicts a hyper-realistic version of Samus Aran, complete with what appears to be both her Chozo Suit and Varia Suit (or the huge shoulder pad things, at least). We&#x27;re particularly impressed with the attention to detail here along with the more grounded take on the character. Being able to see Samus&#x27;s face has frequently been a point of discourse with fans of the franchise, but we think its use here is sublime.

Nintendo and Cygames&#x27; mobile hit, Dragalia Lost, is receiving its next chapter later this week, which will be the conclusion of the game&#x27;s story.
Back in March, Nintendo announced that the action RPG would be shutting down later in the year, with Chapter 26 marking the end of the story. This final chapter will be split into two parts, with part 1 releasing on 23rd June at 11pm PDT / 24th June 2am EDT / 5am BST / 6am CET and part 2 on 24 July.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…</span>

                              <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, &quot;Chaotic Great Edition.&quot; The latter includes the game&#x27;s season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. &quot;This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,&quot; Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland is really good. As we said, it&#x27;s &quot;upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. 
Of course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there&#x27;s more to it than PlayStation&#x27;s ever-growing list of really expensive games.
I had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. 
To my delight, it&#x27;s full of weirdo games you probably haven&#x27;t heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of &quot;Does this look weird and/or interesting?&quot; It&#x27;s been a blast. 
I finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It&#x27;s also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. 
I also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It&#x27;s an objectively bad game but I can&#x27;t help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she&#x27;s evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it&#x27;s bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.
Next up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can&#x27;t wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you&#x27;re finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that&#x27;s a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.


Join Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn&#x27;s dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what&#x27;s happening on the moon.
While that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can&#x27;t go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you&#x27;ll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.
If that&#x27;s not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.

                              <span>Remakes of Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. 
According to Hawk, the &quot;plan&quot; was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. 
&quot;The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn&#x27;t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,&quot; Hawk says in the clip. &quot;Like, &#x27;What would you do with a THPS title?&#x27; And they didn&#x27;t like anything they heard, and then that was it.&quot;
You can watch the full clip below: 
Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔

At the very least, it doesn&#x27;t sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision&#x27;s interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that&#x27;s been a bad idea.  
The news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  &quot;the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.&quot; Alas, history proves otherwise. 
But actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there&#x27;s Vicarious Visions&#x27; Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater reboot. There&#x27;s also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.</span>

                              <span>Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won&#x27;t hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you&#x27;ll get his lightsaber as a reward.
Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It&#x27;ll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.
Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He&#x27;s also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. 
His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don&#x27;t know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it&#x27;s awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here&#x27;s hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!</span>

                              <span>RiotPWR has revealed a new controller specifically designed for Xbox cloud gaming on mobile devices, and it looks great. 
RiotPWR is no stranger to creating controllers with mobile gaming in mind, but today’s reveal is the result of a collaboration and partnership with Xbox. The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. 


“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” 
This controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1.

                              <span>Starting today, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can dive into the wonderful Shadowrun Trilogy on cloud and console. Developed by Hairbrained Schemes and Codeglue and published by Paradox Interactive, these strategic RPGs draw heavily from the boardgame universe and have great stories to tell. The trilogy consists of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director&#x27;s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition.
In Game Informer&#x27;s review of Shadowrun Returns, Matt Miller says the &quot;isometric view, turn-based combat, point-and-click controls, and text-driven dialogue deliver a jolt of nostalgia for longtime PC gamers. Fifteen years ago, games like this established the foundations of today’s Western RPGs. Even so, there’s nothing here that should turn away newcomers thanks to smart updates t…</span>

While fans often debate the merits of modern Sonic the Hedgehog video games, the consensus is that the ‘90s were the franchise’s most consistently great years. Sonic Origins gathers the four games most attributed to that notion, delivering a stellar group of classic titles at its core. But through several modernizations and updates, Sonic Origins makes a strong case for being the best official way to experience Sonic’s heyday in 2022.

Prozatím jde zjevně o řešení pro nadšence, Lenovo samo upozorňuje, že spektrum aplikací běžících nativně na ARM verzi Windows se teprve rozšiřuje. Berme ale tento model jako zajímavou vlaštovku, kterou možná PC svět reaguje na příchod Apple M1 (Pro, Max, Ultra) a M2.</span>

                              <span>The Arctic P12 is one of the best value high-performance case fans - and now you can get five for £23, some 20% off their usual (already good!) price.  
These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I&#x27;ve found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

                              <span>One of the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City itself, a loud and colourful place full of interesting details and decorations. I explored loads on foot, I explored more with the mod adding trains V can ride, and today I&#x27;ve explored even more with a mod adding hovercars. It&#x27;s very cool, and I have only crashed about a hundred times.

                              <span>I realised earlier that today was the last day of Steam Next Fest, and I panicked. I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn&#x27;t the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I&#x27;ve left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

                              <span>The blue hedgehog is back! He goes very fast in his latest instalment, Sonic Frontiers! And lots of fans – naturally – think it looks terrible! The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I&#x27;d like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance &#x27;em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron&#x27;s tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that&#x27;s your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they&#x27;re shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

                              <span>Dinosaurs are cool and scary right? Spiders aren’t so great but they’re definitely biologically intimidating to humans too. Combine the two and you get Shantae developers WayForward’s Spidersaurs, which describes itself as a 2D co-op run’n’gun action game. It’s coming to Steam soon, say WayForward. Try not to get the theme tune stuck in your head when you watch the trailer below.

The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

Elite Boss Tech have agreed to pay Bungie $13.5 million (£11 million). The agreement includes a permanent injunction against Elite Boss Tech that prohibits them from making more software that infringes on Bungie’s.

                              <span>A US court has ordered the former operators of pirate IPTV service Nitro TV to pay more than $100m in piracy damages to broadcaster DISH. While the defendants are likely to be somewhat upset, major Hollywood studios are absolutely fuming. Despite their lawsuit against Nitro being filed months earlier, it&#x27;s still not over, allowing DISH to strike first against any available cash.

We’ve seen it with some Nintendo games, but now we’re seeing it with a PlayStation platformer as well.

                              <span>Hot off the reveal that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 is called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about remakes, their purpose in video games, and what games need and don’t need them. 
As a bottom line, I’m not opposed to any remake. If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that.

                              <span>It’s been a wild month of video game announcements, updates, trailers, and more courtesy of June’s gaming showcase schedule. Between the 2022 Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase, Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, and the third-party PlayStation State of Play, people have been expecting Nintendo to announce its own June gaming direct. 
And it finally has, but it might not be the more general one you were expecting. That’s because Nintendo has revealed that a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 direct is happening this week. 
Tune in on 6/22 at 7am PT for a livestreamed #XenobladeChronicles3 Direct presentation featuring roughly 20 minutes of information about the upcoming RPG adventure for #NintendoSwitch. pic.twitter.com/x3pRs0EYRA
June 20, 2022
As you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. 
While waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July.

Montreal&#x27;s Gotham Knights, a story-based action/RPG that begins with Batman&#x27;s death. As criminals try to take advantage of Batman&#x27;s absence, his understudies are trying to keep order. Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing unite to maintain order, but quickly learn Gotham now bends to the will of the mysterious Court of Owls.

                              <span>Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. 
Now, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. 
Check it out for yourself below: 

As you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 
For more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West.

                              <span>It&#x27;s roughly 20 minutes
A Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Nintendo Direct is set to arrive on June 22 at 10AM ET, Nintendo has revealed early this morning. Given that it was revealed at a Nintendo Direct earlier this year, and is out soon, it only seems fitting!
Here&#x27;s all we know about it at the moment:
It&#x27;ll take place at 10AM ET on June 22
It&#x27;ll feature 20 minutes of info on the game
You can watch it here or below
Now the general lack of English-language Xenoblade Chronicles 3 info kind of makes sense. By and large, we&#x27;ve been reporting on tons of info from the Japanese side of the equation. Nintendo of Japan has provided an extensive website deep dive, as well as various bits of nonstop Twitter info. Now, we&#x27;ll get a full English language Direct that will likely collate everything we&#x27;ve seen so far, including party member info, combat details, and the gem system.
Will we get another &quot;proper&quot; Direct soon? Given the failed predictions from &quot;leakers&quot; that there would be a Direct last week (there&#x27;s more rumors swirling for June 29), it seems as if we&#x27;re at the phase where someone will &quot;predict&quot; a Direct every single week until one actually happens.

During the summer streams over the past few weeks, the flood of new games that were being thrown at us seemed never-ending, and I mean that in the best way possible. We still have a couple more upcoming news streams, but the bulk of it is behind us. The one downside of this is that any titles that were missing from the streams likely won&#x27;t be seeing much love for now, and while we can&#x27;t completely write off individual trailer drops or news posts, there isn&#x27;t anything concrete to look forward to in the near future.
We want to know, what missing games are you still waiting to see that weren&#x27;t fully shown off during June&#x27;s streams and showcase events?
I know I certainly have my answer. In our staff post about which games we were hoping to see during the streams, I came ri…</span>

Good morning, good day, good weekend, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing! You find yer boy and the end of an incredibly hectic fortnight, having somehow fooled himself into writing for this here website every day for two weeks straight. Such is the lot of a game jurnalizt when the fateful month of June comes around. Still, &#x27;tis Saturday, and I such I hope to find myself doing no work whatsoever — at least that&#x27;s the plan, I do enjoy talking about Street Fighter 6.
I hope that you have a pretty empty weekend ahead, or, if it is full, that it is full of joyful, fun, and exciting escapades. If you&#x27;re working, don&#x27;t sweat it, just make sure to really capitalize on the free time that you do have, and fill it with things that keep you happy, engaged, and/or well rested.

                              <span>Riders on the VOID
OlliOlli World was one of the biggest surprises for me this year. I respected the two previous games in the series, but I had bounced off both of them. I was afraid I was going to do the same with OlliOlli World, but now it stands as one of my favorite releases this year.
It’s great to have an excuse to revisit it and feel insecure about how rusty I’ve gotten. VOID Riders is the perfect excuse to do so. It’s a rather sizeable collection of levels and a whole heap of new customization items to unlock. A new mechanic has been slotted in for good measure, as well, giving your thumbs new reason to get confused and disappoint you.

Okay, so this last tarot prediction entry is running late, but we still have weeks of streams so we&#x27;re mostly safe. My life has been in positive upheavals with minor injuries. Sprained wrists, red wine, broken pinky toe, rose incense, rugburn, neat Etsy stuff, and breaking the next toe over. That last one was this morning.
My life has been an Alanis Morissette song as I&#x27;ve tried to get these summer stream tarot readings done. No, not that one. It&#x27;s &quot;Hand in My Pocket.&quot;
Anyway, here&#x27;s the last set of readings. A whopping nine to close this out. If you missed the previous posts, you can find Part 1 here and Part 2 here.

                              <span>Throwback first-person shooters are penny a bushel at the moment, but while most aim to replicate the boomsticks of Quake, Agent 64: Spies Never Die mimics the PPKs and hacking gadgetry of another 90&#x27;s classic. Maybe the name gives it away: it&#x27;s Rare&#x27;s GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64, and there&#x27;s currently a demo available to play as part of the Steam Next Fest.

The demo for Thirsty Suitors starts off strong. Sitting on a long bus ride, there isn&#x27;t much to do but think about life, love, and who your Thirstsona is. And from there, it&#x27;s a long night of dealing with your past, your inner perception, and battling your ex in an RPG duel.
I got to play a slice of Outerloop Games&#x27; Thirsty Suitors as part of the Tribeca Games spotlight this year, and it was hard to slot into a genre. It doesn&#x27;t neatly fit one, and I don&#x27;t think it needs to either. Its blend of adventure, RPG, and even skateboarding simply clicks together, in a fun and very relatable experience.

It seems that Capcom can&#x27;t stop showing us Street Fighter 6. The studio has been feeding the community a steady stream of tidbits ever since its official gameplay reveal during last week&#x27;s Sony State of Play presentation. With the spirit of a parent holding their newborn baby, Capcom has excitedly rolled out character reveals, music videos, test sessions, and a wide variety of minor details and elements.
Despite blatantly stating this past weekend that the developer would be going &quot;dark&quot; on the title, Capcom simply cannot help itself, offering up new clips and information pertaining to everyone&#x27;s favorite Family Man, Guile — first revealed during Thursday&#x27;s Summer Game Fest. We were treated to the news that Guile&#x27;s iconic Sonic Boom now features a &quot;perf…</span>

                              <span>Genre-blending classic returns
Today we&#x27;re going back, waaaaaay back for this week&#x27;s Arcade Archives release. Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it&#x27;s Taito&#x27;s very early, genre-blending shmup Space Seeker.
Released to the arcade market in 1981, and developed several years after the company&#x27;s seminal Space Invaders, Space Seeker features several experimental features and modes of gameplay, with Taito attempting to create a true space action epic. Space Seeker consists of two distinct modes: a Star Wars-inspired rail shooter, in which the player guns down enemies from the gunner seat of their vessel; and a side-scrolling shmup, which utilizes varying scroll speed, a wide palette of color, and air and ground-based enemies.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;p1nkxCKX_ak
While Space Seeker did not quite go on to enjoy the pioneering legacy of Taito&#x27;s other arcade releases, it&#x27;s still a very interesting title — viewed as an experimental effort. With its varied gameplay, technical achievements, and even little touches such as its interactive map screen, Space Seeker was trying to be something special, adding both gameplay variety and technical advancements in the space shooter genre. Today, it is obviously quite dated — and undeniably garish — but it still retains a rep as one of the shmup genre&#x27;s strongest early efforts to rewrite the rulebook.
Space Seeker is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

I have returned (again) but it&#x27;s been an exciting week away! I moved to Calgary for the time being and it&#x27;s been so busy getting everything set up here. Hopefully there&#x27;s nothing crazy to iron out once the stream starts, and the game we’ll be starting with tonight is Fran Bow. It caught my eye because it looks a lot like Samorost 3 but has horror vibes to it too — otherwise, your cute type of point-and-click puzzle adventure, which sounds perfect right now.

Ask me all about the move and tell me how you&#x27;ve been while I was away! See you there tonight!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel every Friday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

Xbox has &quot;reimagined&quot; a pair of classic Xbox 360 Gamerpics for the modern era, and I was not prepared for all the memories these images would kick up. The team dropped a set of new avatars this week, and two of them — a bubble-gum punk with a beanie and a happy panda — should look familiar. Their roots go back to the early days of Gamerpics.

At the risk of strolling too far down memory lane and collapsing into a pile of dust, it&#x27;s fun to think back on the original Xbox 360 Gamerpics — which profile pic did you use?
If you aren&#x27;t a digital avatar hoarder (or if it&#x27;s simply been way too long), here&#x27;s a refresher.
Classic Gamerpics from the early Xbox 360 days

                              <span>Those looking for a different flavor of horde survival might find it in 20 Minutes
The horde survival genre, I guess you&#x27;d call it, has had quite the year so far. Vampire Survivors lit the world on fire, and of course, there have been imitators. But what sets 20 Minutes Till Dawn apart from the crowd isn&#x27;t just its similarities to Survivors, but its key changes that make quite a difference.
I checked out the demo version, cleverly titled 10 Minutes Till Dawn, earlier this year and came away impressed. Well, after a decent number of runs in 20 Minutes Till Dawn&#x27;s Early Access launch, that enthusiasm hasn&#x27;t gone away. Developer flanne&#x27;s roguelike survival still has room to grow, but its core concept is pretty darn solid.

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.
Releasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come.

                              <span>An amusing irony of working an anti-piracy job is that people immediately render themselves redundant when they&#x27;re 100% effective. With that scenario unlikely to ever raise its head, anti-piracy jobs are in abundance. Whether you prefer site-blocking,  IPTV disruption, or just want camcording movie pirates brought to justice, there is no shortage of jobs in the UK right now.

                              <span>Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot&#x27;s announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You&#x27;d be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM&#x27;s Toomgis? How about with the McDonald&#x27;s Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. 
The Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. 
Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. 
Another Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It&#x27;s far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin&#x27;s best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development.

                              <span>E3 2022, of course, didn&#x27;t take place. Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there&#x27;s something about the current setup for the game industry&#x27;s biggest info dump of the year that&#x27;s leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.
What I&#x27;d like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…</span>

The first original IP developed by the prolific studio in over 25 years, Starfield is expected to redefine science fiction RPGs with unparalleled ambition, boasting considerable customization options and scale. I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. 
Sunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets. All open for you to explore.” On cue, the camera zoomed out, revealing countless nodes on an overwhelmingly extensiv…</span>

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is coming to consoles and PC later this year as an Early Access free-to-play title. With that change in business model, Blizzard Entertainment is now offering a bundle for the unreleased game with plenty of cosmetics and extras, including beta access. However, it&#x27;s going to set you back about the full price of a game.
Clocking in at $39.99, Overwatch 2&#x27;s first content bundle, dubbed the Overwatch Watchpoint Pack, does include a game you can play right now. It&#x27;s the Legendary Edition of the original Overwatch which comes with some additional skins for characters and is probably necessary for the next piece of the bundle; purchasers will also be granted access to the upcoming Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28. When the game launches into Early Access proper in October, the Watchpoint Pack covers the cost of the initial season pass and grants skins, in-game currency, and more.
Here are the entire contents of the Watchpoint Pack: 
Guaranteed access to the Overwatch 2 PvP Crossplay Beta (Beta begins June 28th, 2022)
Overwatch: Legendary Edition (includes five (5) Legendary Skins and five (5) Epic Skins)
Additional content granted to purchasers at the release of Overwatch 2 on October 4th
Premium Battle Pass: Season 1 - Two (2) Overwatch
2 Legendary Hero Skins - Space Raider Soldier 76 and Space Raider Cassidy
2000 Overwatch 2 Virtual Currency - Overwatch
2 Player Icon (Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack pre-purchase exclusive)
The Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack is available on all platforms Overwatch 2 which will be available: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Early Access of OW2 starts on October 4, and includes a new character, The Junker Queen. Our own Brian Shea spoke with the Overwatch team about this upcoming game and shift to free-to-play, and you can read his preview of it here.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, Rebirth, during today&#x27;s 25th Anniversary presentation. It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?
It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.

                              <span>At long last, the second chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed during today’s 25th anniversary stream. It’s called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it launches next winter, or towards the end of 2023, for PlayStation 5. 
A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today&#x27;s video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what will be a three-game series.

                              <span>As part of Capcom&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 10th-anniversary celebrations, a sequel has finally been announced. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.


The announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that&#x27;s passed since Dragon&#x27;s Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game&#x27;s director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma II,&quot; which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.
Before the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma. It&#x27;s a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.
There&#x27;s no date for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company&#x27;s RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.

Overnight, Google, EFF, and industry group CCIA intervened to express concern over the scale of the injunctions.

                              <span>There&#x27;s something so intriguing about a new survival game. You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

                              <span>As I might have mentioned once or twice, one of my joys in life is dipping and drifting around rivers and ponds, lochs and seas. I am delighted to see some of the gentle pleasure and wonder of that captured in Naiad, an upcoming game about a water spirit adventuring downstream. It has a free demo in the Steam Next Fest, and it is quite lovely. I believe it to be what the youth call &#x27;wholesome&#x27;.

                              <span>I confess, I was worried about revolutionary robot Soulslike Steelrising. I&#x27;d seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it&#x27;s all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

Thank you once again from the bottom of our massive elephant hearts to our lovely supporters, who let us have lovely silly chats like this.

Capcom last night announced Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, following a nice presentation where the devs reminisced about making the first game.

                              <span>Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that &quot;an objective review&quot; from external advisors &quot;determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence &quot;suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board.&quot;
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that &quot;there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units&quot; in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, &quot;based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.&quot; You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.

                              <span>Grab a pizza slice, kick back, and watch us take on the Foot Clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge! Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.
Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”

We’ve been hearing about Overwatch 2 since 2019, but nearly three years later, the game still hasn&#x27;t been released. Through tumultuous development and terrible company-culture news out of Activision Blizzard, the Overwatch 2 development team has continued working on the game. As revealed on Sunday, the competitive multiplayer component will launch into early access on October 4. Today, Blizzard gave fans an additional glimpse of what to expect when this highly anticipated shooter sequel launches. We also hopped on a ca…</span>

                              <span>This past week, we&#x27;ve witnessed an obscene amount of trailers featuring promising upcoming games, many of which are coming from talented independent developers. Events like Steam&#x27;s Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.
The ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of &quot;show floor&quot; demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren&#x27;t complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.
Xbox isn&#x27;t ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.
Batora: Lost Haven
Broken Pieces
Severed Steel

                              <span>During his Summer Game Fest Showcase, Geoff Keighley was going to surprise reveal The Last of Us Part I, the long-rumored remake of the 2013 title. However, PlayStation seemingly had other (accidental) plans as the publisher leaked everything about Part I hours before its official reveal. 
Keighley and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann took shots at PlayStation during the showcase, and it was clear the two were upset about the leak. Nonetheless, The Last of Us remake is real, and it’s out on Sept. 2. With all that behind it now, fans have begun to focus on the visual updates of Part I, which has seemingly split the community.

Assets seized during the raid will be returned.

First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All&#x27;s well that ends well, though. In response to &quot;overwhelming community response&quot;, Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

                              <span>I am, at present, the world record holder on one level in Neon White. Admittedly, &quot;world record&quot; is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I&#x27;ve had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I&#x27;ve stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

                              <span>My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it&#x27;s a little short on narrative flavour, unless you&#x27;re really into exploring the setting, it&#x27;s got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

Imogen (RPS in peace) spoke with him earlier this year about the game&#x27;s gaslamp fantasy setting and why they chose to enter the survival genre gauntlet, among many other things. At this year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game&#x27;s recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

Rebecca from our guides team has been doing exhaustive work doing live chats and roundups for almost all the streams, and Edders was actually out in Los Angeles to play some games and chat to people.

We play as a potato dodging around waves of aliens while blasting them with sticks, stones, guns, knives, rocket launchers, and weird mutations. I mean it as a great compliment when I say the roguelikelike arena survive &#x27;em up feels like a Newgrounds game.

It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it? Anger Foot is a game about kicking doors at muppet men. That’s it. That’s the pitch. It rules.

                              <span>Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

We touched on the game&#x27;s &quot;beta paths&quot;, its gore system, upgrades, and batteries. There was a lot of chat about batteries. Forgot to ask if they were AA or AAA, though.

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn&#x27;t know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

You might have to wait for some years to see anything from it though, as The Elder Scrolls 6 is only in “pre-production”. We’ll all be sporting Methuselah-length beards and have popped all the achievements in Starfield’s umpteenth DLC by then.

                              <span>V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting&#x27;s first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

                              <span>Intel have finally launched the first of their Arc Alchemist graphics cards, the Arc A380, but only in China for now. VideoCardz spotted the press release for the small-scale launch, which confirms some of the A380 specs, its comfort zone of 1080p / 60fps on medium quality settings, and a recommended price: 1030 yuan. That’s about £130 / $150, not accounting for regional tax maths.

                              <span>How much should a 1440p 144Hz monitor cost, a good one, when it&#x27;s on sale? Normally the answer is around $300, but today Monoprice have gone one further. Their Zero-G 27-in 1440p 144Hz curved monitor has dropped from $250 to $190 - mere pocket change*! 
Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

                              <span>The RTX 2060 isn&#x27;t the new hotness that it was a few years ago, but a global pandemic and chip shortage means that the card is still a surprisingly capable option three years later. The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you&#x27;re willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That&#x27;s a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

As much as I want Arkane Studios to return to the Dishonored series, this talented developer repeatedly shows it may be better off exploring new ventures. Prey and Deathloop support this theory with thunderous success, and the studio’s next experiment, Redfall, looks just as promising.
I recently sat down with Arkane Austin’s studio director, Harvey Smith, and co-creative director, Ricardo Bare, to learn what players can expect from this vampire-slaying experience.
“We’re taking on a giant creative challenge,” Smith says. “We want to hold onto Arkane’s core creative values while taking on an open-world game. It’ll still have the rich narrative design accompanying eve…</span>

In 2021, while interviewing creator Ben Esposito about then-upcoming Neon White, he told me he wasn&#x27;t trying to make a game appealing to everyone. He wanted Neon White to appeal to &quot;really specific people.&quot;
Put another way, as Esposito said in one of the game&#x27;s trailers, it&#x27;s a game made for &quot;freaks.&quot;
I guess that makes me a freak, then. Because Neon White is my favorite game I&#x27;ve played all year – by a large margin.
You assume the role of Neon White; a dead assassin pulled from Hell for a divine competition. Demons overrun Heaven, so the powers that be task White and a host of damned…</span>

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles carved its perfect niche in video games by way of the cooperative beat ‘em up. Titles like the 1989 arcade game and Turtles in Time let fans fulfill the fantasy of kicking shell alongside their friends, but it’s been a long time since our green heroes were the stars of a great video game. Shredder’s Revenge ends that drought, serving as a lovingly crafted homage to TMNT’s glory days that gives fans what they remember while sanding down most of the rough edges.

                              <span>Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. 
Following that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. 


“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.&#x27;&quot;
Smith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. 
Of course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase.

                              <span>Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. 
The studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.
Yes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN
June 13, 2022
As you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. 
I’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. 
Starfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.

&quot;Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.&quot;
Following up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield&#x27;s main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. 
The game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. 
Starfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

                              <span>Movie company Voltage Holdings has a reputation for filing lawsuits against alleged BitTorrent pirates, usually based on IP address evidence backed up by creative interpretations of copyright law. A well-considered and highly logical decision handed down by a judge in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court this week will also be of interest to those facing Voltage lawsuits elsewhere, the UK in particular.

That mostly involved middle aged men in jeans talking through their marketing bulletpoints, but there were also a couple of new announcements in between. One of them was that co-op survival-me-do Valheim is heading to PC Game Pass this autumn.

Called The Forgotten Saga, it has Eivor battling against waves of enemies in Niflheim, and try-die-repeating in order to attain unlocks which persist between runs. You&#x27;ll find a trailer for it below.

                              <span>It should be a rule that any game which shows a slick, edited trailer at E3 (or not-E3) has to then release a longer, more illustrative piece of footage, too. That way we&#x27;ll be able to take our dose of hype, then follow it with a dash of reality. 

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

                              <span>A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a &quot;farmadventure&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it&#x27;s very peaceful, and there&#x27;s no death (a &quot;survival game without survival&quot;). It&#x27;s all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

                              <span>Barbarian-tinged match-3 puzzler Grindstone is abandoning its exclusivity to the Epic Games Store and venturing into the untamed wilderness of Steam on June 20th, developers Capybara Games have revealed. All updates to the game that released on other platforms such as Apple Arcade and Nintendo Switch will be included. There’s a helpfully explanatory animated trailer to watch below.

                              <span>The collective JRPG fandom did a little squee and cartwheeled when Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Portable were announced for PC at Sunday’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase. There was no word on whether either game would make their way to Steam like Persona 4 Golden, though. Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve’s storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

                              <span>If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

It’s worth putting aside at least 10GB ready for the install if you’re planning to take a crack at it. Hop onto your canine mount and check out the trailer below for a glance in advance.

                              <span>While the official way to win 20 Minutes Till Dawn is to survive 20 minutes of monster attacks, I disagree. Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter&#x27;s real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I&#x27;ve beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I&#x27;m delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn. I finally won.

Revealed as part of their not E3 livestream, the Winter&#x27;s Expansion will include three seperate additions to entice fans back into its world of tall vampire ladies and weird dog men.
The first is Shadow Of Rose, a story expansion set after the events of the base game that focuses on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters. In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious &quot;powers&quot;, Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village. Players will guide Rose through a number of spooky locales, including what appears to be Castle Dimetrescu from the game&#x27;s main campaign.

                              <span>When Capcom announced Exoprimal, an action game devised by your six-year-old self where players jump into badass exosuit and then machine-gun roiling hordes of dinosaurs, Alice0 believed that you fought the big lizard-birds with the help of an AI. In a new trailer and deep dive from tonight&#x27;s Capcom Showcase we learned that in fact the dino-rain is happening because of the AI. It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.
If this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here. Entry is open until the 30th of June, and  to avoid disappointment make sure you take note of the entry requirements.

This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.
This version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it&#x27;s floating above its stand. While I haven&#x27;t seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.

This San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a &quot;2022 Summer Convention Exclusive&quot; sticker or the &quot;2022 San Diego Comic-Con&quot; sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn&#x27;t guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention&#x27;s grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.</span>

                              <span>Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show&#x27;s end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.


The Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.
The other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it&#x27;s nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don&#x27;t expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.
If you can&#x27;t wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it&#x27;s available to purchase right now on Steam.</span>

Industria’s inspirations are clear from the jump: Half-Life 2, David Lynch movies, and more. It’s something the six-person team at Bleakmill has mentioned when discussing Industria online that had me excited. You play as Nora, a worker for the East Berlin-based company Atlas, just before the end of the Cold War. Your lover disappears, and you set off to find him, only to wind up in a parallel dimension where machines have taken over what used to be home. Sadly, the four hours following this mysterious and intriguing start fail to live up to t…</span>

With the defendants relying on a fair use defense, both sides are now asking the court to decide the case in their favor, without need for a full trial.

                              <span>There has been no shortage of anti-piracy initiatives in Denmark in recent years. Shutdowns, raids, arrests, and site-blocking orders have repeatedly made headlines. Against this backdrop, it&#x27;s surprising to see that piracy has become more popular, with YouTube and Facebook now the top sources to access content illegally. Meanwhile, password sharing is a growing concern too.

                              <span>Google definitivně vypne prastarou službu Google Talk, kterou provozoval od roku 2005. Byla postavena na protokolu XMPP a dnes je možné ji používat už jen přes klienty třetích stran jako Pidgin a Gajim. Služba ale bude i zbývajícím uživatelům vypnuta 16. června.</span>

                              <span>280mm is my favourite AIO liquid cooler size - cheaper than 360mm coolers while offering better performance per square inch - you just need a case that can accommodate the slightly larger fans. Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around £100 to £180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just £50. That&#x27;s an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting.

That&#x27;s a historic low price on a keyboard that editor-in-chief Katharine called &#x27;probably the loveliest keyboard I&#x27;ve ever used&#x27;. 
High praise indeed, and it was enough to earn a coveted RPS recommendation - even at its original price. Now you can pick up this delightfully clicky keyboard with low profile mechanical switches, a full-size UK layout and a beautiful metal build for £50 less.

                              <span>Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a &quot;story generator&quot; sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.


There&#x27;s no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.


It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you&#x27;ll have a great time doing it.

It’s the latest in a line of games based on the SCP Foundation wiki, a collection of mainly horror-focused stories and faux-reports around a shadowy cleanup organisation and the weird, nature-defying shit they capture and cover up. Judging so far, it’s also shaping up to be perhaps the most complete attempt at an SCP game yet.

                              <span>Starfield is the next big new game from Bethesda Game Studios, and it&#x27;s a pretty big deal because they haven&#x27;t made something that isn&#x27;t a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game in like... ever. So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.
Now, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda&#x27;s brand new IP made it look like they&#x27;ve accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.

                              <span>My favourite spot in Berband&#x27;s colourful night city is a tiny quiet backalley bar at a hole in a wall, and my first task in Nivalis will be attempting to recapture that mood. Nivalis is a slice-of-life sim set in the same cyberpunk city as hovercar courier game Cloudpunk, where we&#x27;ll get to run bars and restaurants, grow ingredients, fish, make friends, and maybe even find love. So like a cyberpunk Stardew Valley? Have a look in the new trailer.

                              <span>We finally glimpsed our first look at some in-game footage from interstellar RPG Starfield at yesterday’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, and it had the feel of a less retro Fallout 4. Everyone knows that the true heart of any RPG is the character creation screen though. It’s just science. Speaking of which, Starfield’s character creation menus are modelling themselves on some real-life science, namely molecular biology. That’s cool, I think.

NotE3 was in full swing this weekend but wasn&#x27;t the only gawp-o-rama around, with Screenshot Saturday still giving looks at birds, a goth Deus Ex, and a vision of an open-world Sonic the Hedgehog chillout.

                              <span>The Wholesome Direct showcase had a whole lotta games once again, but one that really stood out to me was Paper Trail, because it looked and felt quite different. I&#x27;ve already elaborated on the key wholesome themes this year being witches and plants, and Paper Trail is neither of those. It is origami and puzzles. There&#x27;s a very cool free demo out now too, so you can see for yourself.

                              <span>There was a lot going on in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Paradox&#x27;s grand strategy game Victoria III aims to simulate pretty much all of it, starting in 1836 and giving you a century to play with. A big selling point is that every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, from lowly farmer to high rolling capitalist, each having preferences and beliefs. Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.

                              <span>The Flight Simulator series turns 40 this year, which is somehow a distressing thought making me realise how fast time is passing, so Microsoft are preparing to celebrate. Come the 40th anniversary in November, they plan to release a big Microsoft Flight Simulator update with helicopters, gliders, iconic historical aircraft including the Wright Flyer, and more. But that&#x27;s the future. Right now, the game has received a taste of far future with the release of Halo Infinite&#x27;s Pelican aircraft as a real plane you can really fly in Flight Sim.

The tribunal, which is part of the Copyright Office, allows parties to resolve &quot;small&quot; copyright disputes relatively cheaply outside of the federal court system. Damages available under these claims are capped at $30,000 and the entire process takes place online, without the need to hire an attorney.

A second lawsuit ensued when DISH discovered that the men had violated an injunction by launching a new pirate platform called ExpediteTV. That lawsuit has now concluded with a second injunction attached to a $130 million damages award.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.
