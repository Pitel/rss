                              <span>It gets to live on in a new era
Wave Race 64 ruled the roost in so many houses across the world, and now, over 20 years later, it&#x27;s back via Switch Online.
Set to arrive on the service on August 19, Wave Race 64 joins a smallish group of Nintendo 64 classics that are all part of the &quot;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&quot; family. While the rate of games is incredibly slow, the choices have been fairly on point most months, especially when it comes to this beloved oddity.
I mean, the intended effect of putting a lot of these games on modern platforms is...content and adding value to a subscription service. But games like Wave Race 64 just highlight how many franchises Nintendo is sitting on and doing nothing with. It&#x27;s been over 20 years since we&#x27;ve seen a true sequel, and a return could easily work as a downloadable arcade-esque game. Just announce it at a Nintendo Direct, potentially during E3, and you&#x27;re good to go.
You can watch the trailer below! Speaking of, these types of trailers rule, because they&#x27;re bringing old games back in a new way. It&#x27;s a different type of game preservation, and I dig it.

                              <span>Secret of Nevermore
In my four decades of gaming, there have been very few &#x27;new&#x27; genres, and even fewer that have proven to have lasting staying power. Aside from the phenomenon that is Battle Royale, there is probably only one 21st-century-birthed genre that has proven itself with consistent and cemented success with developers, player communities, and cash registers: The Soulslike.
A sub-genre of RPGs, Soulslikes generally feature grim, deep lore, an emphasis on exploration, build-heavy protagonists, and a typically gloomy, gothic aesthetic. Oh, and they&#x27;re also hard as nails. And yet, despite their punishing difficulty, steep learning curve, and joyless demeanor, the Soulslike genre has enraptured a huge community of devotees, won over by FromSoftware epics such as Demon&#x27;s Souls, Bloodb…</span>

I&#x27;m a Senior Editor and I can consider anything as Front Page news. Here is some Front Page News.
Capcom has released a new walkout video for Street Fighter 6, giving us a quick glimpse of the recently revealed World Warriors Juri and Kimberly as they make their way to the field of battle. The intro vid-cum-loading screen will follow the two selected fighters as they step into the ring accompanied by some characterful animations and SF6&#x27;s dopey, but adorable, &quot;Game Face&quot; staredown screen.
In the clip, we see the Korean taekwondo expert and former assassin Juri as she &quot;chats mad shit&quot;, (Flanx&#x27;s words), to her opponent. Newcomer Kimberly has no time for such mind games, instead taking the moment to hype up the crowd and perform some fancy ninja acrobatics. In a cute tough, Kimberly overshoots the camera and has to awkwardly scurry back into shot. That&#x27;s fun.
https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1559329092675047425?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;RegOKDHCGSEuw2ArBLaX9g
The Game Face screen then slams into view, with Juri&#x27;s punk rock sneer and puffed, grumpy cheeks meeting Kimberly&#x27;s sarcastic gurn and knowing smile. It&#x27;s a weird old mechanic, that&#x27;s for sure, but I&#x27;ll absolutely take it all over Street Fighter V&#x27;s charisma-free presentation style. It will be fun to see all of the SF6 roster interact in such a fashion, though I imagine, for the most part, Juri is going to be going ignored by her opposition for most of these walkouts.
Street Fighter 6 launches in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms — While you wait, please check out our previous coverage, including our looks at Juri and Kimberly, our comments on Capcom&#x27;s approach to sequel&#x27;s marketing, and our popular Five Do&#x27;s and Do Not Do&#x27;s feature.

Ship of Fools is the latest co-op game to catch my eye, and if you liked Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, this &quot;aquapocalypse&quot;-canceling adventure might speak to you too. Sailing alone or with a mate, you&#x27;ll fire off cannons and swat creatures on deck.
Team17 and Fika Productions released a new trailer and announced the big day. Ship of Fools lands on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on November 22, 2022.

This is a roguelite game, so the stakes are high if (when?) your ship goes down. You&#x27;ll need to make repairs as you go and smartly chart your course on a shifting map screen.
There are &quot;100+ trinkets and artifacts to collect and combo for winning strategies,&quot; according to the developers, and …</span>

                              <span>Retrace the Myths of Midgard in this rhyming explainer
The holiday season is coming, and with it Ragnarok. Or, at least, God of War Ragnarok. And since it&#x27;s been a few years since 2018&#x27;s God of War, a story recap might be of some use to folks as they gear up for the winter.
PlayStation published a new video today, which recaps the story of Kratos and Atreus from the 2018 God of War. The storyteller walking us through it? None other than The Guild&#x27;s own Felicia Day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ZjucT-UZzgg
The rhyming tale takes a brief tour through the main story beats of God of War, pausing for a few jokes and asides from in-universe character Mimir. And while it doesn&#x27;t cover every single beat, it does a pretty good job summing up Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey, as well as some of the conflicts that arose and still persist headed into Ragnarok.
Winter is coming
It&#x27;s a good refresher to have too, as even though God of War was only a 2018 game, it does feel like eons ago to me at this point. Remembering the reason why Freya, for instance, has a bone to pick with Kratos seems like some important topical study material given some of the Ragnarok teases we&#x27;ve seen.
God of War Ragnarok is locked in for November 9, 2022. It&#x27;s also one of the few games still in the holiday window, as more and more have been delayed out into the next year. Open-world wizarding RPG Hogwarts Legacy recently pushed back to February, and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is on an undetermined delay as of this writing.
Regardless, I&#x27;m really interested to see where the story goes from here, and how Sony Santa Monica Studios&#x27; interpretation of Norse mythology carries on. God of War Ragnarok arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 9, 2022.

                              <span>You can take another crack
Most of the achievements and trophies in Cult of the Lamb are only a matter of time, but I was nervous about needing to topple the main bosses without taking any damage to unlock &quot;Order,&quot; &quot;Sate,&quot; &quot;Cure,&quot; and &quot;Peace.&quot; After trading blows with every bishop in my original playthrough, I figured there had to be some way to initiate a rematch — the notion of needing to start a new save seemed out of whack with the rest of the game&#x27;s player-friendly tendencies. Thankfully, there is a way to replay bosses, and it&#x27;s quick.
Early on, you might&#x27;ve destroyed many of the bishop statues that appear in dungeons since 1) other breakable objects can give you resources for your base and 2) it&#x27;s inherently fun to smash shit. At a certain point, I stopped doing this — that was my m…</span>

Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see. Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

                              <span>Actually, several things are missing.
When something is described as &#x27;ultimate&#x27;, you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that this essentially means &quot;the best of the best&#x27;, or &quot;the most complete package&quot;. Heck, just look at the cast of Danganronpa; they&#x27;re the &quot;ultimate&quot; in their respective fields, showcasing talents that no one else could possibly match, right?
So when Sega launched the &quot;Ultimate Sonic Bundle&quot; on the Switch eShop just yesterday, it&#x27;s quite natural to assume that this encompasses all major Sonic releases on the Switch. As a reminder, this consists of Sonic Mania, Sonic Forces, Team Sonic Racing, Sonic Colours Ultimate, and the recently released Sonic Origins. You&#x27;ve also got the Sega Ages branded releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for good measure, if you&#x27;re a completionist.

Developer Ravenscourt has today announced that the latest addition in their karaoke series, Let&#x27;s Sing 2023, will be coming back to Switch. The first teaser trailer can be found above, and while it provides no release date just yet, it does tease some of the artists and 30 songs that you will be able to find on the game.
Listing off some classic karaoke artists such as Avril Lavigne (&quot;Complicated&quot;, of course), Ed Sheeran (&quot;Bad Habits&quot;), and Jason Derulo (&quot;Acapulco&quot;) alongside modern-day pop royalty including Billie Eilish (&quot;Happier Than Ever&quot;) and Lil Nas X (Old Town Road), the playlist is sure to have us reaching for the high notes — we&#x27;ve got form when it comes to Lavigne. “Your Song” by Rita Ora and Charlie Puth&#x27;s “How Long?” will also feature.

The Kingdom of Hermes has fallen into an age of calamity. In a world where the use of powerful alchemy was once widespread and welcomed, things have gone terribly wrong. The now blood-soaked streets are filled with plague-ridden monstrosities and it&#x27;s up to you, Corvus, to take out the mutated trash.

The Inventory Slot Transfer is one of the most well-known glitches in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, used in countless tricks such as keeping the Bow of Light or duplicating certain items and weapons. We wouldn&#x27;t have tons of other glitches without Inventory Slot Transfer, and we wouldn&#x27;t still be finding new secrets and exploits in the game today.
Gaming Reinvented has once again shared another useful way of utilising Inventory Slot Transfer — this time, to get up to 999 of any material. Just in case you need a few spares! No more farming or spending ages searching for rare materials like giant ancient cores.

The hype for Splatoon 3 has been building ever since last week&#x27;s Direct announcement revealed all of the new content coming to the squid-shooting sequel. One of the more predictable announcements was the return of Turf War battles - soon to be available in three-team mode - where you are tasked with covering the area in your team&#x27;s ink and splatting any pesky competitors that get in your way.
Turf Wars has been a popular game mode across both Splatoon and Splatoon 2, and Nintendo has been quick to cash in on this popularity with a new trailer that showcases the ink-splashing task in action.

One game showcased during the event was the recently released Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey, an adorable and beautifully presented adventure title in which you follow the main character Shinnosuke as he whittles away his free time in a small farming village in Kumamoto.

An upcoming Booster Bundle has been spotted early in some American retailers for The Pokémon Trading Card Game. Spooky!
We say it&#x27;s spooky because this Booster Bundle is Halloween-themed. PokéBeach has shared the findings after a reader sent photos of the packs and cards in. Aptly titled the Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle, the bundles have been found at retailers such as Kohl&#x27;s and Kroger.

Mario Strikers: Battle League has just received a new update. It bumps Next Level Games latest release up to Version 1.1.1.
Compared to the previous update (Version 1.1.0), which added Daisy, Shy Guy, a new stadium and more, this latest patch appears to be quite small. Here&#x27;s the full rundown, according to Nintendo&#x27;s official patch notes. It addresses an issue tied to a goal keeper glitch.

Nintendo hasn&#x27;t outlined the future of Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so what&#x27;s next? Nintendo has today broken its silence, revealing the game to follow up Pokémon Puzzle League will be the 1996/97 jet ski racing game, Wave Race 64.
While it&#x27;s not the first time we&#x27;ve seen it on one of Nintendo&#x27;s digital services, it&#x27;s still a welcome addition to Switch Online&#x27;s N64 library. This game was developed by Nintendo EAD and follows on from the Game Boy original, which was released in 1992.

At the time, details about content and features were still a mystery. However, a short gameplay trailer released today revealed several collectible items and a Dragon Ball-themed map. You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:
The Fortnite Dragon Ball Crossover awaits die-hard fans today.

More specifically, OverBorder Studio&#x27;s take on the action formula popularized by From Software hits consoles and PC on Aug. 18.

                              <span>Squirrel with a Gun is nuts (in the best way)
One of the most fun things about following a bunch of game developers on Twitter is that you get to see the process of how some really cool indie games are made. That&#x27;s exactly what happened to me with Dan DeEntremont&#x27;s upcoming project Squirrel with a Gun — and yes, that&#x27;s exactly what it sounds like.
The first I saw of this awesome game was a viral tweet from back in May of this year, where he showed off the first time he got fur on the squirrel. The whole thing looks insanely realistic, and obviously, the fact that the little fluffy rodent was holding and firing a gun caught everyone&#x27;s attention. (I mean, who doesn&#x27;t love a game with a fluffy, adorable protagonist.)
https://twitter.com/QuiteDan/status/1525631771387338757
Of course, the game has developed a whole lot more in the past few months, and it&#x27;s pretty fun to scroll through DeEntremont&#x27;s Twitter page and see all of the progress videos compiled in one spot.
Squirrel with a Gun has rightfully gotten a lot of attention over the past few months, because I haven&#x27;t seen a game capture the internet&#x27;s sense of humor so accurately in a long time. Now the game has finally been listed on Steam, and while we may not have any kind of release window yet, it&#x27;s cool to see a small developer making bits steps like that. I know I&#x27;m adding it to my wish list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KRz15LfZjBI
Squirrel with a Gun is a testament to how social media has changed the landscape for indie developers in a big way. DeEntremont has been able to make this entire project by himself (at least to my knowledge) and garnered a huge following for it simply because he had a funny idea and the gumption to pull it off.
Here&#x27;s hoping that indie devs continued to be inspired by seeing others succeed like this, because the more goofy indie games there are in my life, the better.

                              <span>Put it back in the bargain bin
I only knew two things before purchasing 2007’s Heavenly Guardian on PS2. First, it was going to be a game in the Pocky &amp; Rocky series, only maybe not really. It looked to be aiming more at Kiki Kaikai, which the Pocky &amp; Rocky games are the sequels to, but I’m not going to get into the finer details of why they’re almost two separate series. The quick version is this: Kiki Kaikai is Taito; Pocky &amp; Rocky is Natsume. Yes, this means that Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky is more a part of the Kiki Kaikai series.
Anyway, that’s boring. The second thing I knew about Heavenly Guardian going into it is that it’s considered to be kusoge.

Totally different
According to articles leading up to the release of Heavenly Guardian, the title was originally going to be Kiki Kaikai 2…</span>

                              <span>See what&#x27;s new in the world of Disney and Marvel games
The D23 Expo is coming up, and with it a bunch of Disney and Marvel reveals. Alongside the movies and series, the games of Disney and Marvel are getting spotlighted in a showcase on September 9.
The Disney &amp; Marvel Games Showcase will air on Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET. Hosted by Kinda Funny&#x27;s Blessing Adeoye Jr., it will feature updates on several projects currently in the works.
Those showing off new content include Disney &amp; Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. New reveals from farming life-sim Disney Dreamlight Valley, tactical hero game Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga are all in store.
We&#x27;ll also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Marvel game from Skydance New Media. That&#x27;s the studio that Uncharted&#x27;s Amy Hennig is leading up, which is working on both a Marvel and Star Wars project.
&quot;The Marvel Universe epitomizes all the action, mystery and thrills of the pulp adventure genre that I adore and lends itself perfectly to an interactive experience,&quot; said Hennig when the Marvel project was announced last year. &quot;It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.&quot;

Games showcases, assemble
Both Disney and Marvel have had a strong video game presence over the years. And now, it&#x27;s joining in on the summer of gaming showcases.
It&#x27;s not the only company with a showcase in September, either. Ubisoft is planning to host an Ubisoft Forward the day after this Disney and Marvel showcase, on September 10. An open-world Star Wars game is in development at Ubisoft, headed by Massive Entertainment. Whether we see that or not, it looks like there&#x27;s a good chunk of gaming news happening in September.

                              <span>Some of the late-hits are toned down, though
Arcade1Up has another retro-revival arcade cabinet on the way, and this one&#x27;s for the sports fans. The new NFL Blitz Legends cabinet combines three remasters of the popular over-the-top NFL Blitz series.
The three games in the cabinet are 1997&#x27;s NFL Blitz, 1998&#x27;s NFL Blitz &#x27;99, and NFL Blitz 2000: Gold Edition from 1999. All three are remastered in the cabinet, which will go for $599.
The cabinet features Arcade1Up&#x27;s usual details, like full side art and a matching riser. Four spots are open for play too, so you can get the whole crew on the sticks for some Blitz. And while it&#x27;s good for local co-op, the Blitz cab also supports online multiplayer via Wi-Fi, as well as leaderboards.
For the cabinet, Arcade1UP partnered with the National Football League and Football Greats Alliance to feature all of the football greats. This includes Dan Marino, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Brett Favre, Jerome Bettis, Terrell Davis, and Cris Carter.

Diving into the endzone
Some of the more rowdy violence has been a bit toned back, however. According to a press release, a specific set of tackles and after-the-whistle hits were removed or edited in the remastered versions of these three NFL Blitz games. These changes support the NFL&#x27;s current Player Health and Safety Initiatives. So sorry, a little bit of the after-the-whistle shenanigans will be tuned down, as they&#x27;ve been in other releases.
This isn&#x27;t the only big arcade cabinet announcement out of Arcade1Up in the last few weeks. The at-home cabinet designer also announced a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet at Evo 2022, bringing the classic crossover and several other cross-franchise fighters together for a fighting game collection.
Pre-orders for the NFL Blitz cabinet are live here at the Arcade1Up site. Shipping is expected to start sometime in early October.

Fans of veteran tactical combat series Jagged Alliance are already getting their gear together for the long-awaited sequel Jagged Alliance 3, which is currently in development at studio Haemimont Games. Publisher THQ Nordic released a new trailer for the RTS title during this weekend&#x27;s Digital Showcase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Ah9O1LQXIvE
Once again set against the backdrop of Grand Chien, Jagged Alliance 3 sees the fictional republic overthrown by a dangerous paramilitary force following the mysterious disappearance of its president. As &quot;The Legion&quot; embeds itself within each and every sector of the troubled nation, the family of its missing ruler reaches out to the clandestine Adonis corporation to send its best team of black ops mercenaries to locate the president, defeat The Legion, and restore Grand Chien to its former state of (relative) order.
The new sequel, which will arrive a full two decades on from 1999&#x27;s Jagged Alliance 2, will feature the tactical engagement and strategic gameplay of its predecessor, powered by a brand new engine and modern-day mechanics. A huge cast of new and familiar mercenaries will be made available for the player&#x27;s home-grown militia, given access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, equipment, and explosive, town-rattling gear. Battle The Legion&#x27;s forces, train local insurgents, and retake the Grand Chien street-by-street in explosive campaign action alone or with co-op support.
Jagged Alliance 3 is currently in development for PC. A release window has not been announced.

                              <span>Thanks, Nintendo
&quot;Nintendo DLC&quot; is still a weird phrase to utter out loud. At one point in the gaming landscape I never really seriously thought it would be a widespread option, but it&#x27;s rampant enough now to the point where it can be considered part of the company&#x27;s identity.
They adopted the practice a little over a decade ago on the 3DS, where it sometimes was implemented in a janky fashion. From there they expanded to the Wii U. And even then I wasn&#x27;t used to it! But once Nintendo started doing regularly scheduled DLC for nearly all of its games on Switch, it all fell into place. I&#x27;ve accepted it.
Which leads me to this: an official Nintendo DLC tutorial video. If you&#x27;re confused on how to buy more stuff, they have you covered! The below video walks folks through the steps of redeeming the free DLC offers via their Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack benefits. It&#x27;s as simple as &quot;going into the Switch Online menu, then scrolling down, looking at the benefits on offer, and clicking on them until you can hit a download button.&quot;
Right now that selection mostly involves Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 DLC. Of note, it does not involve Super Mario Bros. 35, which is still discontinued.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Discourse™ shines the spotlight on gaming chairs
I have a confession: I&#x27;ve never owned a gaming chair, nor have I ever really felt the need to get a gaming chair (well, maybe except for the Hello Kitty x Razer collab, but that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s Hello Kitty). For one thing, they&#x27;re always super expensive, and I&#x27;m trying to ball on a budget over here. I&#x27;ve also heard mixed things from my friends — for the most part, they say they&#x27;re not super comfortable, although my roommate loves that it&#x27;s nice and firm and makes them sit up straighter. As someone who prefers soft, squishy chairs and mattresses, I&#x27;m not sold.
Yesterday I saw this TikTok come across my Twitter feed (man, what a 2022 sentence) and I thought the user @Kesswylie had a pretty good theory about why those good ol&#x27; g…</span>

                              <span>&quot;We&#x27;re not considering that at this point&quot;
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that&#x27;s the plan anyway.
Furukawa noted that they are &quot;not considering&quot; a Nintendo Switch price hike &quot;at this point,&quot; with two factors in play. The chief concern is &quot;pricing people out,&quot; given that they&#x27;re aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).
Another potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to &quot;maintain the momentum&quot; of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn&#x27;t with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that &quot;demand exceeds supply.&quot;
So how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the &quot;OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models,&quot; because &quot;costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea.&quot; But he also notes: &quot;The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We&#x27;re making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that.&quot;

                              <span>The special effects shop is working on a new game set in Middle-earth
A new game set in the Lord of the Rings universe is on the way. Private Division has signed Weta Workshop to a new publishing agreement, for a new game set in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth.
Weta Workshop is a well-known effects and prop company that worked on Peter Jackson&#x27;s adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The company founded an interactive game division in 2014, and now is tackling The Lord of the Rings in game form.
&quot;It&#x27;s a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that&#x27;s so different from what fans have played previously,&quot; said Amie Wolken, head of interactive at Weta Workshop, in a statement. &quot;As fans ourselves, we&#x27;re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings.&quot;
Details on the new project are scarce, as it&#x27;s still in early development. No release date is set yet. But Private Division says the game is expected to launch sometime during Take-Two&#x27;s 2024 fiscal year. More details will arrive sometime in the future.

Middle-earth&#x27;s back on the menu, boys
Private Division is a publishing arm of Take-Two Interactive, and has been behind some notable games like OlliOlli World and The Outer Worlds. The company also acquired OlliOlli developer Roll7. It will also publish Ori developer Moon Studios&#x27; next game.
There are a few different Lord of the Rings projects in development. Whether you like to sneak around as a sneaky little Gollum on a quest for his precious, or dig into a survival-type game, there are a few Middle-earth projects to watch. We&#x27;ll see what Weta brings to the table when it&#x27;s ready to share more about its own interactive LOTR project.

                              <span>Like, in terms of literal size, this thing is huge
The Final Fantasy XIV Island Sanctuary mechanic, in which players are gifted a huge zone to play around with, looks radder by the update. This newest one comes straight from the game&#x27;s official Twitter account, showcasing how gigantic this area is by looking down on it from a grand mountain, then swooping down on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aK9T8jBmebc
The only requirement for unlocking the Island Sanctuary is completing the Endwalker (6.0) main story (MSQ)
While the sequence for the Island Sanctuary is really brief in the official 6.2 trailer above (it&#x27;s at roughly 20 seconds in), the below tweet gives us a lot more to work with.
Operating a lot like a player housing zone (but not quite, as there&#x27;s no traditional housing there), the Island Sanctuary will have independent controls and menu options, and serve as a relaxing respite between dungeon dives. It&#x27;s framed heavily after farming simulators, with crops to manage, and the ability to drop minions on your island.
All of this will arrive on August 23, when Final Fantasy XIV patch 6.2 is live. That&#x27;s just one day away from the massive Genshin Impact 3.0 update. It&#x27;ll be a busy week! Long-term games like these are doing a good job keeping up on updates to help with some of the delay droughts.

THQ Nordic has revealed that work has begun on a brand new South Park game. The currently untitled release was teased at the end of Friday&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 live stream.
Outside of the above sentence, there is literally nothing to be said regarding the release. The couldn&#x27;t be simpler teaser merely consisted of a flash of the South Park Digital Studios logo, complete with a sample of rad dad Randy Marsh screaming &quot;HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!&quot;
Y&#x27;know, from that episode where he did a giant turd... or something.
No gameplay footage, platforms, nor a release window were revealed, and we do not know whether the new game will continue in the point-and-click, turn-based battle tradition of Ubisoft&#x27;s previous releases South Park: The Stick of Truth (2014) and its sequel South Park: The Fractured but Whole (2017). At this point, perhaps the only thing we can guarantee is that Stan and the boys&#x27; newest adventure will probably give global censors plenty of troubled nights.
The new South Park game is currently in development at South Park Digital Studios for THQ Nordic. You can check out a VoD edition of the full THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 presentation right here.

                              <span>There were two big storylines this year
Super Smash Con 2022 ended late last night with the Smash Ultimate grand finals, and it was Onin (Steve) vs. Maister (Sora/Game &amp; Watch). The former took it, which could be Smash Bros. history in the making as they continue to enter more tournaments and rack up more wins. But there were a few good storylines and a lot of good matches this year: let&#x27;s take a quick look.

Onin 3-0ing MKLeo out of the winner&#x27;s bracket, and taking Smash Con 2022
So this is easily the biggest story out of the con, and it involves the main event: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which closed out the con on Sunday night. Onin, a relative newcomer on the scene since the start of 2021, 3-0ed MKLeo out of the winner&#x27;s bracket, and quietly …</span>

                              <span>The Greatest Trailer in The History of Our Sport
During its THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2022 presentation, the publisher dropped a new trailer for its upcoming pro-wrestling title AEW: Fight Forever, which is currently in development at studio Yuke&#x27;s.
The trailer, which contains far more &quot;skit&quot; than it does &quot;gameplay&quot; sees veteran announcer Tony Schiavone settle on the couch with the inimitable Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D, (I hope y&#x27;all did the little hand gesture), as the duo (pretend to) battle it out in All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s console debut. We don&#x27;t really get to see much of the game in action, frankly, but we do see Baker apply the lockjaw to her beau Adam Cole before laying in a beating with a selection of weapons, including bins and fire extinguishers. Spirit of &#x27;99.

Genshin Impact 3.0 is nearly here, and miHoYo just spilled all the details, including the release date!
What&#x27;s in Genshin Impact 3.0?
As a major expansion of sorts, 3.0 will add the new Sumeru region into the mix, and will likely force players into new conflicts with the Fatui. Here are the core tenets of what you&#x27;re getting day one, plus all the updates that will follow in the 3.0 line:
A Dendro moveset unlock for the Traveler
Tighnari (new Dendro character)
Collei (new Dendro character)
Dori (new Electro character)
The Sumeru region
New items
An extension of the Archon (main) story quest
When does Genshin Impact 3.0 launch?
We got that info too! Studio miHoYo has confirmed that it will launch on August 24. We&#x27;ll also get updates on September 28, November 2, and December 7, so the cadence is a little earlier than usual (one week earlier, each).
As a reminder, Genshin Impact 2.0 (which brought the Inazuma region to the table) came out on July 20, 2021, so we&#x27;re just over a year out since the last major &quot;expansion-sized&quot; update.
What are the Genshin Impact 3.0 freebie codes?
Note that these codes are expiring this morning, but have been posted for posterity.
8ANCKTWYVRD5: 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore | 100 Primogems
KT7DKSFGCRWD: 50,000 Mora | 100 Primogems

An Xbox dashboard advert appears to have jumped the gun a little early, and has apparently leaked two new characters who are in line to join the chaotic crossover brawler MultiVersus. The ad, which quickly became widespread on social media, points to the two newcomers being DC anti-hero Black Adam and Stripe, the malevolent antagonist of Joe Dante&#x27;s 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.
https://twitter.com/IronWolfNet_/status/1559045986156089344?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;s8OORNqs-xQfHhE6_en-Ag
Debuting way back in 1945, and under the license of Fawcett Comics, Black Adam was an arch enemy of Shazam! (then still &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;). Originally an ancient Egyptian predecessor of Shazam, DC Comics has readapted Black Adam time and again as a frequent villain, sometimes anti-hero, and othertimes straight hero. Perhaps one of the single most alliance-jumping characters in comic book history, Black Adam will soon make his big-screen debut in a new movie, portrayed by Dwayne Johnson.
Stripe is the closest Gremlins has to an antagonist, given the character&#x27;s nature as the self-appointed alpha of the mischievous monsters. A clone of good guy Mogwai Gizmo, birthed after the latter was splashed with water, Stripe leads his brethren on a Christmas rampage through the town of Kingston Falls, afforded a disgusting new form after tricking owner Billy Peltzer into feeding him after midnight.
You&#x27;re already singing the theme tune, aren&#x27;t you?
MultiVersus open beta is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. You can check out the official season one patch notes, complete with their respective nerfs and buffs, on the official website.

Today sees the arrival of the first official season of content for Warner Bros. Games scrapper MultiVersus. Ahead of the season&#x27;s official kick-off later today, developer Player First Games has released new patch notes detailing the first major MultiVersus rebalance since entering open beta three short weeks ago.
As expected, and of little surprise to anybody, overly-dominant characters such as Adventure Time&#x27;s Finn, The Iron Giant, and Warner Bros.&#x27; main man himself, Bugs Bunny, have all felt a hefty smack of the nerf mallet — mostly in the form of increased recovery times and/or slower startups on these characters specials. The troublesome Taz continues to see his Tornado moves overhauled, with the developer noting that is will be paying particular …</span>

In fact, you can now pick up one of these graphics cards for less than £1200, just £100 more than the launch price of the RTX 2080 Ti for around 75% more performance.

                              <span>The Razer Huntsman Mini Analog is one of a vanishingly small number of keyboards with analogue switches, meaning each key knows exactly how far down it&#x27;s being pressed. That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It&#x27;s also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Keylocker is all about the rhythm. If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack. But you&#x27;ll have to bring your own, because the world in Keylocker hates that stuff. Like in Footloose, music is an illegal activity.

The latest such piece of kit is the display from a John Deere tractor, jailbroken and fragging away at demons at this past weekend’s DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas. The tractor computer was hacked by Sick Codes, who’s trying to draw attention to farming equipment manufacturers who lock down their products to prevent owners from repairing them.

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the &#x27;bug&#x27; in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

                              <span>Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That&#x27;s Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that&#x27;s much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there&#x27;s more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

                              <span>The dream of a multiplayer Spider-Man has been unearthed in the PC files for Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on Steam. A few references point to Insomniac Games possibly toying with a two-player mode that would include both Peter Parker and Miles Morales, before likely abandoning it for one reason or another during…

                              <span>MarkMonitor has asked a Florida federal court to destroy or permanently seal documents discussing its anti-piracy systems. The information could be beneficial to &quot;pro-piracy&quot; forces, MarkMonitor fears. The documents are part of a now-settled lawsuit between record labels and ISP Bright House. Interestingly, the destruction request piqued the interest of another ISP: Cox.

A local online store managed to get some Steam activation keys but sold out, despite selling them for close to the most expensive price in the world. Right now, Russians can either wait for new stock or take advantage of the game being cracked on day one.

Get ready for a bunch of announcements (maybe), reveals (probably), and free game promo T-shirts that are only available in one size (definitely) as Gamescom unfolds over five days, featuring most of the big publishers and developers, plus a ton of indies.

It&#x27;s a great credit to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s game design that five years on, we are still discovering new things. These various breakthroughs have come in many forms, from glitches to finding secret locations to interesting character interactions, and the latest one came from Reddit user&#x27;s persistence in hunting down very specific NPCs.
Those who have played Breath of the Wild — which, we assume, is almost all of you reading — will be well aware of the banana-dropping Yiga Clan and their duplicitous shape-shifting interruptions over the course of your journey. But did you know that each wandering Yiga member&#x27;s disguise is in fact based on another NPC somewhere else in Hyrule?

                              <span>Well, that&#x27;s gone FAST.
It&#x27;s pretty hard to believe that Sonic Mania is already five years old. It feels like only yesterday that we were getting excited about a return to the classic Sega Mega Drive / Genesis Sonic games of old, and Sega, Christian Whitehead, and everyone involved knocked it out of the park.
Sonic Mania was a huge hit, and it became the highest-rated Sonic game in fifteen years when it was first released. It also made household names of the people who worked on the game — many of whom originally worked on Sonic fangames and ROM hacks.

As a part of Pokémon Unite&#x27;s first anniversary celebrations, we have been progressively seeing more fighters added to the game over the course of two waves (because if the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Courses have taught us anything, it&#x27;s that Nintendo fans love a wave-release).
The latest wave began with the addition of Glaceon back in July and Buzzwole earlier this month, but today sees Tyranitar, Generation II&#x27;s Rock/Dark-type enter the fray, subsequently concluding this first batch of anniversary character releases. To mark the occasion, The Pokémon Company has shared a trailer showing the pseudo-legendary Pokémon in action as it showcases its powerful Rock, Ground, and Dark-type abilities. Check it out above!

                              <span>Meanwhile, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 falls out of the top ten.
Last week saw Xenoblade Chronicles 3 take a tumble from its top spot after a record-breaking opening to fall into the 10th position on the UK charts, and this week has been no easier for Monolith Soft&#x27;s massive JRPG.
Slipping out of the top 10 completely, Xenoblade&#x27;s departure has left a gap which has interestingly been filled by Sega and Two Point Studios&#x27; Two Point Campus. After a strong opening week across all consoles, Two Point Campus takes the number two spot on the UK charts this week — thanks in large part to the stellar Switch release which accounts for a huge 64% of the game&#x27;s sales. Here&#x27;s a look at the split across all consoles:

Private Division, a publishing arm of Take-Two Interactive, has announced that it has entered into a collaboration with the New Zealand special effects and prop company Wētā Workshop to create a new game set in the world of J.R.R Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-Earth. It will stand as the first major video game project for Wētā Workshop, a company that most famously worked extensively on Peter Jackson&#x27;s Lord of the Rings trilogy, creating everything from sets to armour and weapons. It created a games development division back in 2014.
Despite Wētā&#x27;s familiarity with the movie adaptation of Lord of the Rings, Private Division&#x27;s announcement states that &quot;Middle-earth Enterprises have licensed the literary works of the series, providing Wētā Workshop with the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books&quot;.

                              <span>Making worlds, characters, and memories in &#x27;I Was a Teenage Exocolonist&#x27;.
Revealed for Switch back in July, publisher Finji is bringing Northway Games&#x27; I Was a Teenage Exocolonist to Nintendo&#x27;s console (and others) on 25th August. A narrative RPG with card-based battles, it sees you growing up in an off-world colony, with all the hardship that brings in addition to the more familiar and typical difficulties associated with navigating your teenage years into adulthood.
It&#x27;s a coming-of-age &quot;sci-fi life sim&quot; with card-based bits, then, but one which doesn&#x27;t shy away from mature themes and seems to gently reflect some of the existential crises we&#x27;re increasingly facing in the real world, albeit in a cosier, less unremittingly bleak manner than the many and various survival game press releases that drop into our inbox on a weekly basis.

                              <span>A big win for representation.
The Splatoon series is widely considered amongst fans to be one of the coolest franchises in Nintendo&#x27;s line-up, showcasing style and modern sensibilities that other IP in its catalogue has nary even touched upon.
With Splatoon 3, however, it seems Nintendo may have taken a bigger step in the direction of diversity and representation. As part of its recent Direct Presentation, it was revealed that a new trio called &#x27;Deep Cut&#x27; would be handling the in-game news items, replacing the &#x27;Squid Sisters&#x27; from Splatoon 1 and Pearl and Marina from the last game. The group consists of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, with the former proving to be a popular talking point amongst fans, many of whom believe that Shiver may be Nintendo&#x27;s first major non-binary character.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time for adventure!
After nine long years in development, developer DeskWorks has created what can only be described as a perfect embodiment of when imagination takes over with RPG Time: The Legend Of Wright. Spilling colour, nostalgia, and a little bit of childlike glee onto the pages of a notebook, this is a heartwarming tale of two friends at the end of a school day and a humorous take on a heroic adventure.
The story is set out by Kenta, a ten-year-old aspiring game developer with unmatched ingenuity. The construction of Cardboardia, alongside a cast of unforgettable characters, resides on the desk in a classroom, and each element of the game adopts a lovingly handmade appearance. Comprised of puppets, cardboard cutouts, and some pretty incredible origami, Kenta is keen to share the tale of Wright with the player from the moment you boot up the game.

Police at the scene state that some furniture has been damaged in one room on the building&#x27;s third floor, but nothing more significant.

More specifically, the Red Planet sequel to Deliver Us The Moon will no longer be released on September 27 and will instead hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 2, 2023. That&#x27;s a delay of roughly four-ish months. As for why, KeokeN Interactive released a statement alongside the news, citing that the game needs more time to be the best it can possibly be.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny&#x27;s Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature &quot;incredible new content&quot; from Disney &amp; Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a &quot;sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.&quot; 
JUST ANNOUNCED: Watch the Disney &amp; Marvel GAMES SHOWCASE on Friday, September 9 – live from #D23Expo 2022! https://t.co/uZcDYdUZKA pic.twitter.com/RJ67ooTR2F

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig&#x27;s new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it&#x27;s probably a safe bet to assume it won&#x27;t be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won&#x27;t be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I&#x27;m hoping Hennig&#x27;s game is based on the X-Men, but since it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

“We could not be more excited to bring NFL Blitz Legends to fans who have been waiting years for the return of this iconic game,” Arcade1Up CEO writes in a press release. “Our team spent the better part of the last two years making sure we both honored the games’ past while bringing it up to toda…</span>

                              <span>Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it&#x27;s a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

                              <span>PlayStation and Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 hit, Ghost of Tsushima, is being developed into a feature film with John Wick director Chad Stehelski set to direct it. The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

After seemingly leaking by way of an in-game startup screen uploaded to MultiVersus a few hours too early, Player First Games has confirmed that both Black Adam and Stripe from Gremlins will hit the free-to-play stage fighter during its first season. You can check out the official announcement below:

Set to launch sometime today, Season 1 will feature a healthy dose of content for the free-to-play stage fighter, although exactly what remains unknown. However, we do know that Morty from Rick and Morty will join the roster next week on Aug. 23. Beyond that, the studio says that new modes and content will be added to the game throughout the duration of Season 1.

Well spank my ass and slap on the Factor 30, it&#x27;s another weekend and another Whatcha Been Playing? You find yer boy Moyse melting in the midst of another UK heatwave, the second of such in the past six weeks. My fridge is filled with nothing but water, sugar-free soda, and this weird-smelling spray that cools you down. Imagine if it was just liquid nitrogen... I&#x27;d get my Jason X on.
Going out and about is a little risky at the moment, especially for my aged goth-ass flesh, so I will likely be spending much of the weekend cooped up indoors, staying cool with Tango ice lollies (other brands are available) and doing my very best to get on top of a truly horrendous bout of Bad Brains, (not the D.C. band). The weekend is here, and I&#x27;m very happy to see you again. I hope that …</span>

I remember being intrigued while watching my old roommate play through Hybrid Heaven. In my younger days, I had rented it and written it off for a reason I think is perfectly valid: all the environments look the same. Watching him play through it didn’t prove otherwise. Hybrid Heaven is metallic corridors from eyebrows to toe-hairs. But something about the way he was enjoying it was infectious.
After he completed it, he told me that “he probably wouldn’t have tolerated it without save states.” That is not glowing praise, but the experience was enough to keep Hybrid Heaven rolling around in my head for years until I finally found it for a reasonable price. By now, the game has been built up in my mind that I almost had to play through the entire thing. Good or bad.

If there is one thing my Apple Arcade subscription has taught me over the past few years, it’s that games designed around gacha mechanics don’t necessarily have to be the type of whale-hunting monstrosities that result in terrible YouTube “influencers” bragging about how they can’t play anybody online anymore because they spent $100,000 in it. Games like World of Demons and Star Trek: Legends are enjoyable gacha games in part because you don’t have menus popping up constantly goading you into dropping cash in them. With that monetary incentive removed from these titles, players are free to enjoy the actual gameplay without worrying they’ll miss out on something huge if they don’t buy a loot box or start a game-specific subscription service.

Narrative games may be a small niche within the gaming industry as a whole, but there’s an even smaller subsection of the genre that a lot of gamers don’t know about: interactive fiction also known as IF. With the exception of some UI upgrades or a musical score, the vast majority of IF is just simple text on a screen that the player clicks through. It exists in the space between my two favorite things: literature and video games. Technically interactive fiction got its start in the late 1970s with text adventures like Zork, but now the world of text-based games has taken on a whole new life.
I’ve always dabbled in the world of IF, but when I came across this thread on Twitter, it reminded me that the community surrounding this genre is mo…</span>

                              <span>As a non-player, the trailer for Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Patch 6.2, Buried Memory, is indistinguishable from every other patch trailer. There&#x27;s enormous boss monsters, several types of void, an incongruous cat creature, Death maybe... Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV&#x27;s new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

                              <span>Gothic was one of those PC games I dismissed as being for nerds. Me? I was too busy making Half-Life levels and reading Championship Manager fanfic to be interested in some game about mages in a hole. 

I&#x27;ve since realised the errors of my ways, and I quite fancy the chance to correct my previous wrongs via the Gothic 1 remake. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it and its big modern hole below.

                              <span>One of the top requests from fans was &quot;more challenging content&quot;
Right from the get-go, there was a wide variety of reactions to Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin. The copious &quot;chaos!&quot; exclamations in the reveal were definitely a driving factor in that divide, but as I dug into the game at launch, I found a lot to like, including some of the bolder and somewhat out-there choices with the narrative.
We sat down recently with director Daisuke Inoue and producer Jin Fujiwara to really take in the game&#x27;s impact thus far, and where it might be going now that the DLC campaign is underway.
[There are story spoilers for the Stranger of Paradise core game present throughout the interview.]

Following on from last week&#x27;s glorious Namco release Dig Dug, Hamster has turned its attention to Messrs Taito once again, bringing the veteran developer&#x27;s alternate history shmup Gun Frontier to the Arcade Archives range on Nintendo Switch and PS4.
Released to the coin-op market in 1990, Gun Frontier is a truly wild clash of narrative ideas and visual designs. Set in the 22nd century against the backdrop of the planet &quot;Gloria,&quot; a ruthless band of space pirates — The Wild Lizards — have captured the star and set its people to work, mining the precious gold ore that lies beneath Gloria&#x27;s surface. In one final bid for freedom, the settlers commandeer a bizarre, pistol-shaped tank before embarking on an all-out mission to defeat the oppressors and free the p…</span>

Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most beloved TV series of all time (and for good reason), and it&#x27;s about damn time it got another video game adaptation. This week Square Enix and Navigator Games announced that they&#x27;re collaborating on an Avatar: The Last Airbender mobile game for Android and iOS, which is launching in Canada, South Africa, and Sweden this month ahead of a wider release.
The game, titled Avatar: Generations, will be a free-to-play RPG that will include squad-based battles and in-game adventure sequences (whatever that means), according to GameSpot. Players will be able to explore an open world, as well as relive iconic story moments from the show as well. We can also expect to see all of our favorite characters like Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Suki, Zuko, Appa, and Momo. Future updates will give players access to Avatar Kyoshi, Korra, Roku, and explore all four of the nations.

Square Enix and Navigator put up an official website for the Avatar: Generations, although it&#x27;s basically empty as of now, so it&#x27;s worth coming back to in a bit when they release more information. There&#x27;s also no hint as to when the full release of Generations might be, but considering it&#x27;s a mobile launch, odds are it won&#x27;t take as long as the typical game releases we&#x27;re used to.
I&#x27;m honestly shocked that the games industry hasn&#x27;t given ATLA more love up until this point, considering how big and enthusiastic the fanbase is. I&#x27;m sure most of us would prefer a full AAA treatment over an Avatar mobile game, but it&#x27;s a good place to start.
There have certainly been some good mobile games based on bigger franchises in the past few years — Fallout Shelter being chief among them. Hopefully if Generations does well, some of the bigger studios will catch on to the potential that this franchise has to make some really kickass games.

The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

                              <span>The more time I spend with Valve’s Steam Deck, the more I’m fascinated by it. While it’s obviously rad for the incredibly rich selection of games it plays, I’ve found it’s actually a really solid mini-PC for work, creation, and just everyday PC-related tasks, so today I’ll show you how to get started using your Deck…

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That&#x27;s only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn&#x27;t completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure&#x27;s questionably designed back half. In this episode, we&#x27;ll discuss DMC 4&#x27;s bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom&#x27;s reasoning behind Nero&#x27;s conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it&#x27;s really like to visit Fortuna&#x27;s inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero&#x27;s big debut.

                              <span>Arguing over which Halo game is the best is an exercise in futility. Fact: They’re all amazing! For the past two decades, first under Bungie, then under 343 Industries, Halo has put on a master class of tone, pacing, and raw, punchy first-person gameplay. But perfection is non-existent; just as most every Halo game…

Brand comfort is important but so too is affordability, especially when pirate copies are available for free. Some find a middle ground with purchases of discounted activation keys but, as a new Microsoft lawsuit shows, that can amount to copyright infringement for buyers and sellers alike.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

More specifically, Hogwarts Legacy, originally due out sometime this year, will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 10, 2023. The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today&#x27;s announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

The official MultiVersus Twitter account has revealed that Season 1 for the popular stage fighter will begin next Monday, Aug. 15, after a delay to the season was announced last week. Morty from Rick and Morty, who was set to drop with Season 1, will join the roster roughly a week later, on Aug. 23. Also, the team has announced that everything coming to the game in Season 1 will not drop on the same day, citing that new modes and content will drop throughout the season. 
Quick Note: Everything we are bringing to you in Season 1 will not drop on the same day. New modes and content will be spread through the life of the Season. We&#x27;ll continue to share dates on all the fun things to come!

Asus, then, are about to increase the number of OLED gaming monitors on the market by 100%, with the ROG Swift PG48UQ and ROG Swift PG42UQ. And I’ve just had a brief, but generally impressive, play around with them.

                              <span>Of the many games announced during THQ Nordic&#x27;s Showcase this evening, Space For Sale is the one that caught my eye the most, primarily because it looks a bit like Animal Crossing with aliens. In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase &#x27;colony sim&#x27; to its literal extreme, didn&#x27;t they? Are we sure that isn&#x27;t Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I&#x27;m saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn&#x27;t... astronommical. Sorry. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

This time it&#x27;s a reimagining of the original 1992 game, where you&#x27;ll delve into Derceto Manor as returning characters Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby in an attempt to figure out what&#x27;s happened to Hartwood&#x27;s missing uncle. As you&#x27;d expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.

It&#x27;s called Wreckreation (you know, like &#x27;recreation&#x27;, not Wreck-reaction, or Wreck–eation) and its reveal trailer looks a bit like if Burnout and Hot Wheels went for a joyride together.

                              <span>As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven&#x27;t shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat&#x27;s in-game meow. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I&#x27;m beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they&#x27;ll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it&#x27;s like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

The latest video from Kitfox Games, who are handling the polished release, features original DF co-creator Zach Adams talking through new menus and artwork... while taking his fort&#x27;s bins out.

In the past few years, several studies have linked loot boxes with gambling, and several European countries have moved to regulate them. In a statement given to Eurogamer, EA said that Ultimate Team packs are &quot;a part of FIFA that players love&quot; and that &quot;Giving players the choice to spend if they want to is fair.&quot;

                              <span>This is a bit different from what we normally cover, but I was going to order this for myself and thought it might be of interest to you, dear reader, as well. Anyway, you can get ten years&#x27; worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that&#x27;s a nice little savings - and of course it&#x27;s far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

                              <span>The Crucial X8 is our favourite portable SSD, thanks to its compact protective frame, convenient USB-A or USB-C connection and excellent performance. It&#x27;s capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it&#x27;s dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

You can&#x27;t deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You&#x27;re okay.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port&#x27;s development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

                              <span>Free-to-play gacha MMO Tower Of Fantasy was struggling with server issues after it lauched yesterday, but - touch wood - no more. The developers say that these are now fixed and that players should find it easier to log in and play. They&#x27;ve also said there&#x27;s more fixes planned for the next couple of days.

                              <span>Welcome once again to The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we&#x27;ve decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It&#x27;s an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

                              <span>In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot &#x27;em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven&#x27;t heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

It seems cool, so I&#x27;ll play it with former Associate Editor John Carson today!
We&#x27;re going live at 2:00 p.m. Central on our Twitch page, and then I&#x27;ll upload it to the Game Informer YouTube channel afterward. See you soon.</span>

Don&#x27;t Stress Too Much About Your Cult&#x27;s Faith Dropping To Zero
Your followers’ faith in your cult drives everything in Cult of the Lamb. If you fail to keep them fed and happy, or if you decline their sub-quests too much, or even simply neglect to clean up their poop, their faith will drop. Any kind of wrongdoing, neglect, or slight against them, can cause them to lose faith in y…</span>

                              <span>Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it&#x27;s polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion&#x27;s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a &quot;comedy open-world RPG&quot; where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You&#x27;ll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

                              <span>For weeks now, leaks and rumors have pointed to a Dragon Ball Z collaboration happening with Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite. Now, such a crossover has been officially confirmed. 
Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, &quot;Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022.&quot; Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let&#x27;s be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we&#x27;ll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today&#x27;s overview trailer reveals that Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That&#x27;s exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby&#x27;s different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too).

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.
Though LeBron James appears on the roster thanks to his starring role in Space Jam: A New Legacy, the WB roster in MultiVersus doesn’t feel as icky as the roster of that film. Each character is treated with reverence, creating a world where you eventu…</span>

A Reddit user claims to have leaked plot summaries for every single episode, noting that two account suspensions by Reddit add credibility to those leaks. Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO&#x27;s lawyers in California.

After a drawn-out fight at the US Court of Federal Claims, only the scale of the damages is to be determined. After a recent trial hearing behind closed doors, the final figure could be anywhere between $115,000 and $155,400,000.

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd. Huzzah.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that cameras which actually take pictures are better than running into a wall so fast you hurt yourself. Immersive sims shudder in revulsion from this outcome (but sadly don&#x27;t take damage from their vibration). Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is the latest ex-PlayStation exclusive to rock up on PC, following a collaborative effort between original developers Insomniac Games and porting specialists Nixxes. It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

Betrayal At Club Low is the name, and an RPG infiltrating a former coffin factory-turned-nightclub is its game. This time, Cosmo D says he&#x27;s inspired by one-shot indie RPGs as we roll dice, bake pizzas, and try to help an undercover agent escape.

As of today, Farthest Frontier is now in early access.

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi.</span>

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter. 
Splatoon 3 leaves behind Inkopolis in favor of Splatsville, which is out in the heart of the Splatlands. Splatsville is a growing city that has rece…</span>

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

Uhodnout jde například RSA klíč. Ve skutečnosti Apple M1 nemá SMT, ale pokud by v budoucnu Apple měl procesory se SMT, tak by také patrně byly zranitelné.</span>

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s patch 1.06 offers dozens of small tweaks that should make your journey across The Land Between just a little easier. The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they&#x27;re the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

Rather than simply die and reload a save, you&#x27;ll respawn elsewhere in the world, ready to hunt down your new named Nemesis. They might even loot your gear and use it against you.

As efforts to gather intelligence and seize domains continue, the studios have also been dealing with PrimeWire replacement &#x27;HydraWire&#x27;. But despite the numerous hurdles, all signs point to the plaintiffs toughing the case out for as long as it takes.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>To say that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was successful would be an understatement. The highest-grossing video game film in U.S. history already had a confirmed threequel in the works, but today we found out exactly when we&#x27;ll see Sonic and friends return to the big screen, and it’ll be chillier than usual.
The official movie Twitter account announced the unofficially titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will premiere in theaters on December 20, 2024. This marks a big seasonal shift for the franchise as Sonic 1 and 2 arrived during the first halves of their respective years, with the first movie premiering on Valentine&#x27;s Day and the second arriving in April.

The tweet doesn’t reveal anything else about the film, but if you’ve seen the post-credits scene for Sonic 2, you already have a good inkling of where the series is headed. 
December 2024 is a long way off, but Paramount plans to fill the gap with a live-action series starring Idris Elba’s Knuckles hitting Paramount+ next year. There’s also Sonic Prime, Netflix’s animated series that, while disconnected from the film universe, provides another avenue to enjoy the Blue Blur on the small screen. With the next big video game, Sonic Frontiers, slated to launch this fall, the next few years look pretty bright for Sega&#x27;s mascot.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he rides solo today to showcase a quick glimpse of You Suck At Parking, an upcoming racer with a very unique twist. Instead of racing to a finish line, your objective is stop...in the marked parking stop.  
Stopping in a parking spot might sound easy but as you&#x27;ll soon find out, it&#x27;s anything but because each track is littered with obstacles such as barriers that immediately destroy your car, magnets aiming to pull you off the track, boosters, jump pads, and more. You must survive through it all in order to reach the coveted parking spot at the end of the road. 
Check it out for yourself in the New Gameplay Today below: 


Enjoy this first look at You Suck At Parking as Wesley briefly introduces you to the world of the game before taking a back seat to let you enjoy some uninterrupted gameplay (that&#x27;s harder than it looks so when you see me die a bunch of times, no you didn&#x27;t). You Suck At Parking is slated to launch sometime this year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise may have turned 30 years old last year, but the party is still going for some. We already knew additional Sonic-themed costumes were planned for Fall Guys this month, but developer Mediatonic this morning announced the details of the collaboration event with Sega&#x27;s iconic brand. The event is meant to celebrate over 30 years of Sonic the Hedgehog and includes a new Sonic-themed level and new outfits. 
The new level is called &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; and tasks the Fall Guys beans with collecting as many rings as possible to win special rewards. If players earn 200 points, they get a &quot;Bean Hill Zone&quot; nameplate. Earning 400 points yields 200 kudos, 600 points get a Bonus Rings Pattern outfit, 800 points gives 400 kudos, and 1,000 points gives you access to Sonic&#x27;s iconic sneakers.
Those aren&#x27;t the only rewards you can snatch up during this event, though. New costumes for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Super Sonic, and Dr. Robotnik are all available in the store during the event. You can also buy the Sonic Foot Tap emote.
This isn&#x27;t Sonic&#x27;s first appearance in Fall Guys as a costume. Back in 2020, players could pick up this Sonic costume. This special Fall Guys event featuring Sonic the Hedgehog begins on Thursday, August 11, and runs until Monday, August 15.
Fall Guys originally launched on PlayStation 4 and PC, where it found overwhelming success as a fun gameshow-style twist on the battle royale genre, in 2020. In 2021, publisher Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic. Earlier this summer, Fall Guys changed from a premium model to a free-to-play model, and launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Switch.</span>

Not only will you be getting a glimpse at what combat in the game looks like, but he gives you a brief glimpse of what you&#x27;re doing in The DioField Chronicle when you&#x27;re not in a battle. 
Developed by Lancarse and Square Enix, this RPG is aiming to feel unique amongst a sea of other tactical RPGs by infusing real-time combat into its formula. So while you are controlling units on a battlefield, you&#x27;re watching their moves play out in real-time, and you must adjust your classic tried-and-true TRPG strategies to match it. 
Check it out for yourself below:

The demo showcased here takes place completely within Chapter 1 so if you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, you should be alright. The DioField Chronicle hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Sept. 22.

                              <span>Marvel’s Midnight Suns, the upcoming card-based strategy RPG by Firaxis, as been hit with its second delay. A Take-Two earnings report revealed that the game had been pushed out of its October 7 date to an unspecified release within the 2023 fiscal year. That means it will now arrive sometime before March 31, 2023.
The game’s Twitter account confirmed the delay with a message, embedded below, that also revealed that the game will now have a staggered release. Midnight Suns will come to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC first within the fiscal year. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive sometime after that.

August 8, 2022
While Midnight Suns will only face a five-month setback at most (for current-gen, at least) and could technically still arrive in 2022, seeing it suffer another delay is disappointing nonetheless. The game was first announced almost a year ago at last year’s Gamescom. It graced Game Informer’s cover that month and was first scheduled to launch this March before being delayed to October. A reimagining of the Rise of the Midnight Sons comic event, players control a team of occult heroes like Blade, Magik, and Nico Minoru and Avengers like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man to battle Lilith, the mother of all demons. Midnight Suns&#x27; turn-based combat utilizes a card system for selecting commands, and between battles players explore a headquarters where they can socialize and bond with their teammates. 
We played the first four hours of Marvel’s Midnight Suns in June and wrote up seven takeaways based on our time with it. You can also watch us battle Venom as Spider-Man and other heroes in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Nyní se většinou nastavuje hostname až v user-space, případně při překladu jádra ( CONFIG_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME). Jsou ale některé případy, kdy je potřeba hostname ještě před přimoutováním /. Například mdadm potřebuje hostname a porovnává ho se záznamem homehost pro rozlišení lokálního pole a dočasně připojeného cizího pole.</span>

                              <span>I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time testing gaming laptops these days, but one of my recent favourites was the Zephyrus G14. This laptop is slim and compact, yet sports a brilliant 14-inch 2560x1600 120Hz display, a powerful RX 6700S graphics card and a top-end Ryzen 9 6900HS processor. This is backed with a 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM (!!), an impressive loadout that uses basically the fastest and latest-gen components you can fit into a laptop of this size. 
Today Best Buy in the US are doing a great price on this spec of the Zephyrus G14, charging $1399.99 for it rather than the launch price of $1649.99 - a $250 reduction. That&#x27;s the best price we&#x27;ve seen for this model and an awesome deal on a compact yet powerful all-AMD laptop.

                              <span>Graphics cards are falling in price rapidly, and nowhere is this more true than on the bleeding-edge end of the market. After seeing discounts on AMD&#x27;s first 6000-series graphics cards last month, we&#x27;re now also seeing deep cuts to the more recent 6X50 models - including the subject of this piece, the Radeon RX 6950 XT. This particular card is the very fastest that AMD make, and offers rasterised performance on par with Nvidia&#x27;s RTX 3090 and 3090 Ti.
Today, it&#x27;s been discounted to £850 at Scan, a big reduction from its original UK RRP of £1065 earlier this year.

                              <span>You might remember that I couldn’t beat Spelunky 2&#x27;s first stage, no matter how hard I tried. Well, I&#x27;m proud to announce that my fortunes have since changed and that I&#x27;ve bested it. I should say &quot;we&quot;, as my achievement was aided by a co-op pal, and the only person on Earth patient enough to accompany such a terrible Spelunker. We even reached the first boss, and the level after that! Before we both got splatted by an anti-gravity zombie-puppet-that-lives-underwater.
Aside from my – our – achievements, I learned that the game is a perfect measurement of fatigue. Where rulers calculate distance or Ollie&#x27;s highly scientific WIPERS precipitation system measured the best rain in games, Spelunky 2 is the ultimate tool for accurately determining just how tired someone is.

I&#x27;ve crossed the active warzones of GTA Online and PUBG, stunted down murderous descents in extreme sports games, tried to learn serious bike race tactics in strategy games, gone for a weird ride in a walking simulator, and even needed to ride my real bike for a game powered by Strava. For your convenience and enjoyment, that&#x27;s now all gathered here with some bonus bike thoughts.

                              <span>Is it lazy to describe Turbo Golf Racing as ‘Rocket League if the cars were playing golf instead of football?&#x27; A bit, yes. But it’s also largely accurate. Up to eight players race across a track, ramming their boost-enabled car into their huge futuristic golf ball to send it flying forwards until (depending on your skill or luck) it flies/rolls/plops anticlimactically into the big hole at the end. It’s golf, sort of, but fast, demanding, and often unpredictable. You don’t even have to wear silly trousers while playing it, but that’s just my personal choice.
Of course, it’s not quite so simple as hitting your ball forward and relying on the videogame gods to deem your ball worthy of reaching the goal before everybody else’s. There are 30 courses of varying length and complexity, and none of them are a simple drag race to the end. There are ramps, twists, turns, and plenty of obstacles. While the very shortest courses are pretty frictionless (I’ve won a few in under 20 seconds), the longest ones are practically begging you to make agonising mistakes.

This week, my eye has been caught by a surreal RPG, a squirrel with a gun, a typical tentacle horror, handcrafted spaceships, and plenty more interesting indies.

                              <span>Bandai Namco have released a teaser for...well, something Tekken related, although exactly what is open to interpretation. The brief trailer, shown yesterday at Evo 2022, replays the moment from Tekken 1 in which Kazuya Mishima drops his father&#x27;s body off a cliff, before cutting to a much more modern looking Kazuya and the simple invocation: &quot;GET READY&quot;.

                              <span>Demons happened. There&#x27;s your plot. More specifically, they apparently happened to everyone except you, but the process still messed with your tv, so there&#x27;s nothing for it but to fight your way through them to some kind of solution.


Demons Happened is a curious blend of very rapid action faintly reminiscent of Hotline Miami, and an Abe&#x27;s Oddysee type of puzzle game. Such disparate genres don&#x27;t often blend as well as this, and I&#x27;m disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t got a bigger reception.

BREIN also booked significant progress on the site blocking front, an effort that continues this year. Meanwhile, its plan to warn and educate persistent infringers is taking longer than expected.

                              <span>Dragon Ball FighterZ is finally getting rollback netcode by way of the newly announced PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. The update will also be available on PC.
For the unfamiliar, rollback netcode is a system that provides a nearly lag-free online experience, hence why it&#x27;s always a highly desirable feature in the fighting game community. During EVO 2022, DBFZ producer Tomoko Hiroki shared that the current-gen versions will support rollback netcode, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One editions will not. There&#x27;s no release window for upgraded ports, but a message from Bandai Namco&#x27;s Twitter account states we&#x27;ll learn more information later and that it will take &quot;some time&quot; before the system is finished. 
While that&#x27;s bad news for those who don&#x27;t own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, Bandai Namco is at least planning some sort of upgrade path for existing game owners on current consoles (such as Smart Delivery on Xbox). There&#x27;s no mention if the Switch version will receive a rollback netcode.  
Hiroki also announced that Dragon Ball FighterZ is now content-complete, meaning it will not receive any more fighters or balance updates. The game received three DLC fighter packs during its lifetime that added over a dozen characters to its roster. 
Dragon Ball FighterZ first launched in January 2018 and was hailed as one of the best fighting games of the decade and arguably the best Dragon Ball video game period. You can read our review of the launch version of the game here.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco revealed a big update for Tekken 7 during this weekend’s EVO tournament, which may have also teased the next entry in the long-running series.
A trailer running down the Tekken 7 balance update, which arrives on August 17 and introduces balance adjustments and new tactics, concluded on a tantalizing note. A clip of Kazuya’s semi-infamous Tekken 1 arcade ending, in which he drops Heihachi off a cliff before giving a cheesy smile to the camera, transitions to a smirking modern Kazuya with a message of “Get Ready.” The clip begins at the 1:40 mark. 


Fans have excitedly interpreted this footage as a teaser for Tekken 8. That would make sense; Tekken 7 launched on consoles in 2017, so it feels like the right time to begin hinting at the next entry. Perhaps it’s a different Tekken project entirely. Or Bandai Namco simply thought this would be a humorous footnote to wrap up its Tekken 7 news.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that it will live stream a Splatoon 3 Direct this week. 
More specifically, it will begin at 6 a.m. PT on Wednesday, Aug. 10, and will feature roughly 30 minutes of updates. Check out the announcement for yourself below:

As you can see, there’s not much else to glean from this news. If you’re the kind of person who anticipates game-focused Directs to reveal information about other anticipated titles, I would say you should not do that with this one. It seems very much a “we’re only going to talk about Splatoon 3” kind of Direct announcement. Of course, I could be wrong, but you know, expectations and all that. 
However, if you’re a Splatoon fan, it sounds like Wednesday will be an excellent day. Not only are you getting new Splatoon 3 details and information, but “roughly 30” minutes of it – that’s a lot! As for what to expect, new weapons, characters, maps, and story details will likely be showcased. This will probably be the last Splatoon 3-focused Direct, too, considering the game hits Switch less than a month after it on Sept. 9. 
While waiting for Wednesday’s Direct, check out this Splatoon 3-themed Switch console and then listen to this new punk rock-inspired track from Splatoon 3’s soundtrack. After that, check out the latest Splatoon 3 gameplay trailer.

                              <span>SNK revealed during the Evo 2022 fighting game tournament held in Las Vegas that a new Fatal Fury game has been greenlit and is now in development. 
This news comes from a short teaser trailer that showcases a new look at some Fatal Fury art alongside the following message, which plays on screen: “The city of legend still breathes. Hungry wolves back on the prowl. A new destiny hidden in darkness. New Fatal Fury/Garou green-lit.” 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, SNK didn’t reveal much else, and if you’re a Fatal Fury fan, you probably have many questions. Will this new game adopt a 3D art style like other modern fighting franchises such as Street Fighter 6, or will it stick with traditional 2D art? Which fighters are returning? Will there be new fighters? Only time will tell. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Fatal Fury, you might recognize the name Terry Bogard, who regained some popularity after his inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He’s the protagonist of the Fatal Fury fighting game series. If you don’t recognize that name either, nobody can blame you – the last Fatal Fury game came out 23 years ago, with Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves’ release in 1999. 
It’s unclear when we’ll hear more about this new Fatal Fury game, but it’s nice to know at least a game is in development for the classic fighting franchise.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that Juri will join the roster of Street Fighter 6 alongside newcomer Kimberly.


Returning competitor Juri is a “sadistic thrill seeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes,” according to PlayStation. She first appeared in Super Street Fighter IV. Before SF6, her primary motivation was exacting revenge on M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now waits for a new motivation to arrive. If you’re a fan of Juri, don’t sweat – she retains many of her past moves in Street Fighter 6, although you can expect them to have “different properties” now. 
For example, Fuhajin returns and sees Juri perform an upwards kick that stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are new special moves but “…</span>

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn&#x27;t even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer.

                              <span>The developers of Crypt Of The NecroDancer just sneakily announced a followup. It&#x27;s called Rift Of The NecroDancer, and it&#x27;s a &quot;standalone rhythm game in the NecroDancer universe.&quot; You can watch its surprise reveal below, at the end of the trailer for the newly released Synchrony DLC for Crypt Of The NecroDancer.

                              <span>My first encounter with Frogwares&#x27; Sherlock Holmes games was the Consolevania drubbing of Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, but the series has come a long way since. Alice loved last year&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, which stars a young, hot Holmes.

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

                              <span>Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
