                              <span>In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making &quot;gaming&quot; earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers &#x27;round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 just got a small update, mostly to fix a long-running music bug. But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems the recent 20th anniversary update for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

                              <span>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at r/twosentencehorror will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here&#x27;s a creepy good &#x27;un: &quot;&#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. &#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,&#x27; it parroted back from the next room.&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. &quot;It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings,&quot; she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

But first, credit where credit&#x27;s due, a big thanks to @aschefield101 for both card blanks and foil effects!

                              <span>For those building your own server around the new Intel Xeon 6 &quot;Granite Rapids&quot; or AMD EPYC 9005 &quot;Turin&quot; platforms and using DDR5-6000/DDR5-6400 memory (or the interesting MRDIMM-8000 memory with Xeon 6 P), one of the factors you need to be much more mindful about than in the past is that at least the initial generation of DDR5-6000+ memory is running much hotter than prior server memory. There&#x27;s been guidance from Intel and AMD as well as sever vendors about the thermal considerations with DDR5-6000/DDR5-6400 and extra precautions. Here&#x27;s a look at the DDR5-6000 thermals on a recent AMD EPYC 9655 Turin server build and then taming the DDR5 server memory modules using Corsair Vengeance Airflow Memory Cooling Fans.</span>

                              <span>Popular indie games Palworld and Terraria will have some crossover content next year in Palworld. Very few details have been shared about the tie-in, but we know information will be coming soon.


Palworld Terraria crossover is incoming


Viewed over 1.8 million times on X since the Tuesday announcement, the official Palworld social media account posted a crossover image. It has the Terraria Guy and Palworld&#x27;s main character shaking hands. Not much else is known other than we&#x27;re getting information &quot;coming soon.&quot; 


Palworld also says that there will be at least one more update before the end of the year. This time, it says news about the next update will be coming &quot;very soon.&quot; 




Terraria is no stranger to crossovers. Don&#x27;t Starve Together has the Eye of Terror, new bosses, and a bunch of new skins inspired by Terraria, while Terraria received one new boss and plenty of items based on the Klei property. Terraria also received Stardew Valley-based content, such as the Blue Chicken and Stardrop, while Stardew Valley implemented the Meowmere sword. 


Based on past history, it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll see Terraria elements in Palworld, and vice versa. Based on the art, we could see Cattiva, Depresso, and Chillet in the world of Terraria. On the other hand, perhaps some weapons and crafting items could be craftable in Palworld.

This is the first good news for Palworld fans for a while. The game&#x27;s developer, Pocketpair, has been sued by The Pokémon Company. The plaintiff claims that Pocketpair has infringed on three patents. It&#x27;s been reported that the Pal Sphere system veers too close to a Pokéball.

The Night Ops update expands this aspect through its new Night and Day cycle, bringing a unique threat in the darkness.


The dangers of the night force you to use various light materials, specifically with the latest NVG equipment. Here&#x27;s how to get Night Vision Goggles in Gray Zone Warfare.

The world of Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops offers you three versatile options for night vision devices: PVS-7, PVS-14, and PVS 31A.

The game is now live on both Android and iOS, and you can also download the PC version using Netmarble&#x27;s launcher. There&#x27;s already a vast set of characters available at launch, and here&#x27;s my tier list for them (based on early access performance). 


Complete King Arthur: Legends Rise tier list


Characters in King Arthur: Legends Rise are of different rarities, and they also play different roles. Additionally, certain characters offer buff when teamed up with their preferred choices. In short, building your best team won&#x27;t be easy at all. However, it&#x27;s always important to focus on the tier list to get the best use of your resources.

While later generations have only become more advanced and complex as the years have gone by, Sony&#x27;s second foray into the console market still reigns supreme, even after 20-odd years.


In fact, the PS2 still holds the title of the biggest-selling console of all time. According to Sony, the PlayStation follow-up —which was released in 2000 and recently celebrated its 24th anniversary  —has sold more than 160,000,000 units worldwide.

To put that into perspective, the Nintendo DS – arguably one of the most successful handheld consoles in history – sold around 154 million units worldwide in its lifetime. That&#x27;s pretty close, but it does put it arou…</span>

                              <span>Developers Strikerz Inc has released a fresh set of patch notes ahead of the launch of UFL early access, which will be available on all current-gen consoles. 


After a previous round of delay, players will be able to get their hands on the upcoming football simulator on December 5. Grabbing a Starter Pack will help you to get seven extra days of gameplay, and a handful of other benefits. Before that, let&#x27;s take a look at all the changes coming to the game ahead of the early access release. 


Complete UFL early access patch notes


UFL was originally scheduled for a release in the month of September. However, the developers decided to push back the launch based on community feedback, and come tomorrow, owners of the Starter Pack will be able to enjoy all the content.

                              <span>The new Ode to Castlevania DLC for Vampire Survivors has arrived, with over 20 new characters to unlock. There are a lot of specific rules, so we&#x27;ve made this guide to help clear the air on what you&#x27;ll need to find your favorite Castlevania characters.


The DLC has a massive map, and there are a lot of places to go. As you defeat bosses, you&#x27;ll unlock persistent warp points. These will allow you to hop to specific bosses and areas of the map faster in subsequent playthroughs.


There are bosses that certain characters need to kill to unlock more content. We&#x27;ve created a map below with the locations of these specific bosses. Make sure to check which character needs to defeat them in the table under that.

                              <span>Blue Lock Rivals is an action soccer game where you get to channel the signature styles of Blue Lock characters. It’s everything I wanted if a proper Galactik Football game existed but in anime style. Check out the Blue Lock Rivals Trello board for the latest info on the game.

Here are the most popular and useful Blue Lock Rivals community channels:



Official Blue Lock Rivals Trello Board


Blue Lock Rivals Discord Server


BLR Roblox Community Page



Unlike other Roblox RPGs, BLR takes the idea of races and classes and turns them into soccer styles and flows based on characters from the show. You should also check out a full list of Blue Lock Rivals codes to claim free goodies. You can find information on all of these on the community Trello board, in addition to:



What the game is and how it’s played


Other useful links


Keybinds


Gamemodes


All Styles


All Flows


Emotes


Cards


Goal Effects


Techniques


Codes


Gamepasses



I would check out the percentages to roll all styles and flows first. That way, you can gauge whether you should reroll. That said, Discord is also a great source of information on the game, but from a more social side. You can ask other experienced players there for tips or how certain mechanics work. It’s a great place to check with others what strategies work and what to avoid.


The Blue Lock Rivals Discord is also where you can track news, updates, and announcements for the game. I like checking back often for patch notes to see what was nerfed, buffed, or added. Also, you can find more codes here for free goodies in addition to any giveaways. Check back for giveaways and other prizes often.


And that’s how to find the Blue Lock Rivals Trello and Discord. Check out our other BLR guides right here on Destructoid.

                              <span>The Bazaar&#x27;s closed beta is already receiving praise from the gaming community, and it could be an exciting addition to the world of digital card games.


That said, the closed beta has its share of issues that can prevent you from enjoying the gameplay. It&#x27;s one of those titles that require a persistent internet connection, and there have been instances where players have been unable to connect to the server. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you might be able to fix the situation if such troubles occur.


How to fix the &quot;Unable to connect to the server&quot; error in The Bazaar


If you see this message pop up, it means that the client is being unable to connect to the server. Till the situation is fixed, you won&#x27;t be able to enjoy any bit of the gameplay. Here are a few steps you can take to solve the problem from your end potentially. But first, make sure to check the server status.


You can do so by following the game&#x27;s X handle or by joining the official Discord. If the servers are down for some reason, chances are that you can find the relevant information here. While the servers are down, there&#x27;s not much that you can do apart from bidding your time.




When I get the error (which appears to be random), I usually restart the game. I am unsure why restarting your client fixes the issue, but it appears to be the best solution. Of course, this should be done only when you&#x27;re sure that the servers are operational. Doing this while there&#x27;s maintenance going on isn&#x27;t going to fix anything at all.


That said, The Bazaar&#x27;s servers are reasonably stable, and there aren&#x27;t too many bugs that will spoil your experience. However, it&#x27;s still a beta, so expect to encounter bugs and glitches occasionally. The game can be bought directly from the game&#x27;s website, and becoming an early founder will have certain advantages in the long run.

Since the game has a lot of RPG-themed content, it’s best to keep track of it all via community channels. Here are the official Arcane Seas Trello &amp; Discord.

Here’s where you can join the official Arcane Seas Trello board and Discord server for the latest info on the game:



Official Arcane Seas Trello Board


Arcane Seas Discord Server


Roblox Community Page



These links, and especially the Trello board, are where you can find all the current, up-to-date content information on the game. The Trello is run by the community, so all the latest updates will be displayed there. You can find info on the:



Game itself and its One Piece inspirations


Game controls


FAQ


Daily rewards


All races


All factions


All quests


NPCs


Armors


Accessories


Gamepasses



Lastly, you can also find the latest Arcane Seas codes here under the Game Information section. I would also recommend joining the Discord channel. While Trello has a lot of information on content, Discord is where you can get opinions from the community itself. You can search for specific questions you might have or just chat with other players about the latest updates.


Speaking of which, the Discord and the Roblox Community hub are where you can track announcements on the latest patches. I also like reviewing patch notes here and seeing what got buffed or nerfed to adjust to the meta of the game. With all the different classes, races, and special abilities, it pays to be updated on what to focus on.


And that’s how you find the Arcane Seas Trello board and Discord server. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more Arcane Seas guides.

                              <span>Stalker 2 has its fair share of unique weapons that you can unlock, and the Trophy rifle is certainly one that can easily remain hidden throughout your entire save.


Typically, you can unlock extra weapons if you&#x27;ve purchased the Deluxe/Ultimate Edition. These weapons can be found in different Journalist Stashes, and you&#x27;ll get them gradually. That said, the Trophy gun is available even if you&#x27;ve purchased the Standard Edition. 


As I said, finding it can be a bit tricky, and there are high chances that you might have gone past the place without knowing that there&#x27;s a secret gun for you to discover.


How to get the Trophy gun in Stalker 2


To find this weapon, you&#x27;ll have to play a bit to unlock the Chemical Plant region. This place has plenty of POIs, including the Army Warehouses, which itself has some great resources. If you&#x27;ve purchased the Ultimate Edition of the game, you can also find the Lullaby assault rifle from this spot. To get the Trophy gun, you&#x27;ll have to travel west from where the Army Warehouses location. To simplify matters, I have marked the location on the screenshot below.


Image via Destructoid


Once you reach the spot, you&#x27;ll notice a broken structure. I am not sure what exactly it is (it looks like a broken incubator), and you&#x27;ll find a corpse lying in front of it. If you look carefully on the map, you&#x27;ll find two other structures located close to this spot. All three structures are actually connected, and all you have to do is throw a grenade through the opening of the structure (the one with the corpse).




Just wait, and there will be three explosions. The third explosion will open a structure similar to the one where you threw the grenade. Once cracked open, you&#x27;ll find a stash waiting for you to be unlocked. This stash contains the Trophy gun (an assault rifle, rather) and a bunch of useful items like ammo, consumables, and grenades.

When we check out the latest UK Charts data each week, we generally have a pretty good idea of where some of the newest titles will end up placing. Granted, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a little lower than our estimates when it debuted in 14th place last week, but when we scrolled through this week&#x27;s list and found it had disappeared entirely, well, we frankly couldn&#x27;t believe it.
Alas, it&#x27;s true. The exceptional RPG remake from Square Enix has crashed out of the top 40 altogether, marking a stark difference between audiences&#x27; tastes in the UK when compared to Japan. We knew it would never do gangbusters, of course – Dragon Quest never really does well in the UK – but goodness, this is absurd. At least its performance over in Japan will likely be enough to keep Squeenix satisfied for now.

The Switch has seen its fair share of Cotton titles since Reboot! landed on the hybrid back in 2021. In the years since, we have snatched up Cotton 100%, Panorama, Guardian Force Saturn Tribute, Fantasy, Rainbow Cotton and a host of others. In short, this Arcade Archives release will be adding to one heck of a collection.

Back in September, Koei Tecmo announced another Atelier game for Switch. We still don&#x27;t have a precise release date for the catchily-titled (deep breath) Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian, but we do know that it&#x27;ll be launching at some point in 2025. Other details are slim, but Koei Tecmo has shed a little more light on the upcoming project in a recent tweet.
Let&#x27;s get the biggie out of the way first: Atelier Resleriana will not include a gacha system. The game&#x27;s mobile predecessor, Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator, was guilty of relying perhaps a little too heavily on pull rates and paid-only options, so it&#x27;s nice to hear that we&#x27;ll see no such systems in the console spin-off.

                              <span>But with voxel-based visuals.
Given the sheer magnitude of Animal Crossing&#x27;s popularity (New Horizons is currently sitting pretty at 46.45 million units sold on Switch), it&#x27;s no surprise that other companies will want to take a peek at Nintendo&#x27;s homework and conjure up something similar.
The latest effort is seemingly cooking away within the walls of Ubisoft, as a new report from Insider Gaming suggests that the company is hard at work on a new social-sim project by the codename of &#x27;Alterra&#x27;. It&#x27;s said to be inspired by Animal Crossing while utilising a voxel-based visual setup (think The Touryst and you&#x27;ll be on the right track).

This game was confirmed for the Switch in 2023 during an Indie Direct and since then it&#x27;s received some delays. The developer has also suffered some layoffs during this period, and also ended up releasing additional DLC for Crypt of the NecroDancer earlier this year.

The Switch has smashed all sorts of records but one thing it hasn&#x27;t done just yet is surpassed the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 2.
While it was assumed at one point the hybrid system only needed to shift another 15 million units to surpass this milestone, PlayStation&#x27;s ex-CEO Jim Ryan burst this bubble earlier this year, claiming the PS2&#x27;s lifetime sales were recorded as 160 million units.

Where to get Simple Fertilizer in Towers of Aghasba


Unlike many items necessary for crafting in Towers of Aghasba, Simple Fertilizer cannot be found by simply picking it up off the ground. It has to be made in-house at a Compost Shed, and you have to be one to do it. Firstly, you&#x27;re going to need to build a Compost Shed in your village on Amani Island. This is the tutorial island and the location where you start the game.


To build it, you&#x27;re going to need some fairly common resources:



3 x Clay - Found in Clay Mounds on the ground. Use a Shovel to dig it up.

In simple words, these Powers of Witchcraft can be considered as new powers or abilities that can be taught to your character. These powers have three different sources - Eldritch, Psyche, and Growth &amp; Decay schools of the Hawezar sorcery. There will be a total set of 24 choices to pick from, and you&#x27;ll have to earn something called the Restless Rot to unlock them. Let&#x27;s take a look at how the different powers are shaping up, as revealed on the Campfire chat on November 21.

There will be seven different powers to pick from as far as the Eldritch school is concerned.

Where to get Elastic Fins in Towes of Aghasba


If you do what Towers of Aghasba recommends in its tutorial and check the Tooltips for where to find a resource for Elastic Fins, you&#x27;ll be told that they come from creatures with similar characteristics. As helpful as that may or may not be for you, it doesn&#x27;t tell you exactly how or where to find them. Thankfully, they aren&#x27;t too hard to find, but there is a bit of random luck involved with getting them.

                              <span>There’s an issue with Valorant when it comes to Windows 11 that may require you to enable Secure Boot on your end.


Playing Valorant on PC can have all sorts of issues ranging from anti-cheat, updates, and other technical problems. If you’re getting issues after installing Windows 11 or you’re on fresh hardware, you may need to try this.


How to check for Secure Boot on Valorant on PC


To see if you’re able to enable Secure Boot, you must first check if your computer supports it or if it has been turned on. Follow the instructions below:



Press the Windows Key and X at the same time. 

You can also press the Windows button at the bottom of your screen.




Type “msinfo32” without the quotes and hit enter. 


The System Information menu will come up.


Under the System Summary tab, look for BIOS Mode and Secure Boot State.


BIOS Mode should be set to UEFI and Secure Boot State should be set to On.



What is more important is the Secure Boot State option. If it isn’t on, or you can’t set this option on, you may need to upgrade or downgrade your OS (Operating System). If on Windows 10, try going to 11. If on 11, go back to 10. 


It’s a hassle, but this is one of the more consistent workarounds to get the Secure Boot State working.

How to enable Secure Boot on PC for Valorant


To enable Secure Boot, turn off or reset your PC. If you turned off your PC, boot it up again and then follow these instructions: 



When restarting or turning your computer on, press the corresponding key that will bring up the BIOS.


More often than not, it’ll either be F2 or F11. 


In the BIOS settings, look for Secure Boot and set it on. 



If your keys, layout, or process are different, it’ll depend on your motherboard manufacturer. That will require an additional search to look up the menu layout and navigation for your specific part.

Alongside a Viktor rework, League of Legends will also undergo major changes to the gameplay, Battle Pass, and Rewards system in the popular MOBA. Here are all the changes you should expect in League of Legends 2025 Season 15.




Welcome to Noxus


Each season in 2025 for League of Legends will focus its seasonal structure on a different region in Runeterra, dictating the gameplay updates, modes, mini-games, and champions that come with each season based around the region. For League of Legends Season 15, the first season of 2025, it will revolve around Noxus, a mighty empire in Runeterra with a fearsome reputation.

The announcement was made along with the latest update to the Mina the Hollower Kickstarter. That&#x27;s fitting since, in addition to a bunch of beloved Shovel Knight tracks, the concert will feature an unreleased track from Yacht Club&#x27;s upcoming Zelda-inspired game. 


The concert will run for two hours, featuring jams from the main Shovel of Hope campaign, as well as DLC additions Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards. Gameplay footage will serve as the backdrop while the live orchestral and rock ensemble takes over the stage. 


Here&#x27;s the trailer and location info:




Shovel Knight: Steel Thy Concert Show Dates



Los Angeles, The Fonda Theatre, January 19th, 2025


New York City, The Town Hall, February 22nd, 2025 



There will also be a live chat with special guests from Yacht Club, as well as exclusive merch like shirts, keychains, and posters. Those who opt for a VIP pass will get to attend a meet-and-greet and poster signing with composer Jake Kaufman, designer Sean Velasco, programmer David D&#x27;Angelo, and artist Nick Wozniak. 


Tickets are on sale now, and there&#x27;s currently a 20 percent discount until December 3. Purchases made during the sale period will also come with a free Steam key for Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon. 


If this has you both reflecting on the past and looking toward the future of Yacht Club Games, it sounds like Mina the Hollower is doing well. According to the latest update, the team is close to having a stitch ready so the game can be playable all the way through for the first time. We&#x27;ll have to wait until 2025 for more on that, though.

                              <span>Carcassonne is a firm favorite in our house. It was one of the first “proper” board games my daughter learned to play, and it’s my partner’s first pick every time. I like it because I like any game that I can convince them to play without too much begging and cajoling. It’s easy to teach, quick to set up, and the base game takes about 45 minutes to play.


There are nine readily available Carcassonne expansions available. Adding them all at once makes for a hot mess of a game, but they all have their benefits and are great in their own right.


Below, you can find all nine major expansions, ranked by my preference, although everybody will have their own ideas.


I haven’t included The Catapult because it’s out of print and pretty awful. And you won’t see The River. Although The River is gr…</span>

                              <span>The FC Pro Live Challenge 2 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the fodder challenge to unlock a free pack for your Ultimate Team squad. 


EA Sports has been releasing regular fodder challenges in the lead-up to the Black Friday celebrations. These SBCs are really easy to complete, and the latest one is no different. Completing it will help you to unlock different rewards, so let&#x27;s take a look at how you can finish it before the SBC expires from Ultimate Team.

Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 2 SBC solutions


The priority will be to use items that are already available in your Ultimate Team squad. If you&#x27;re short of certain items, you can always use the following solution to quickly complete the SBC.

In recent years, the types and quantity of packs have only increased. During promos, there are promo-specific packs as well, which have better odds of getting pack items.

                              <span>After many years of hopeful speculation, CD Projekt Red just finally announced that the studio is, indeed, putting all of its efforts into bringing The Witcher&#x27;s next mainline game into fruition.


Michał Nowakowski, CD Projekt&#x27;s joint CEO, just took to the studio&#x27;s website to inform that the development of &quot;Project Polaris&quot;, the codename for the new Witcher project, has been ongoing for several weeks now.


&quot;I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication&quot;


More interestingly, &quot;Polaris&quot; refers not just to the tentative The Witcher 4, but to its sequels as well, since &quot;Polaris&quot; stands for a whole trilogy, not a standalone game.


Nowakowski also talked about the recent success of Cyberpunk 2007 and Phantom Liberty.


&quot;In less than four years since release we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips&quot;


It took them a good while, but it seems as though CD Projekt has finally been able to break the curse and turn Cyberpunk 2077 around. Here&#x27;s hoping the studio has learned its lesson(s) and takes the necessary time to make sure the next chapter in the Witcher series comes out in great shape.


The Witcher 4 still doesn&#x27;t have a release date, which is to be expected. However, we&#x27;ll be watching closely and hoping that some day soon, we&#x27;ll know when to expect this next entry in this beloved series.

                              <span>Are you counting down the days until the release of a Devolver Digital-published game? If so, you might be tacking on some more waiting, since tomorrow will mark the return of Devolver Delayed, the stream in which the publisher announced which games aren’t going to hit their planned release date.


‘Tis the season, by which I mean, it’s nearing the end of 2024. Games marked “Coming in 2024” are running out of year to push things out the door. Everyone is firing up their PR machine to update their schedules, and, as usual, Devolver has the most ostentatious way of doing it with a stream dedicated to pushing things back. Kicking them down the field. So on.


What games are on the docket? I don’t know! According to Steam, Devolver has three games that are still slated for 2024: Stick It to the Stickman, Skate Story, and Baby Steps. Could be any of them. Could be all of them. Two of them are defending their titles from last year. Maybe they’ll get creative and delay a game that hasn’t even been announced. Perhaps they could push back a game they already released. They could delay a game that they aren’t even publishing. Such power!


If it’s anything like last year’s stream, it will be short. Devolver Delayed 2023 was three minutes. Would you rather that your hope sprung eternal? Well, then, they’ve also coyly added, “And who knows, we might even show you something new.” They might! It’s a possibility!


Devolver Delayed 2024 is airing on November 27, 2024 at 10 am PT (1 pm ET). They gave me this link to give to you.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company, along with 30 other European content creators, has won a Guinness World Record this month. In a 24-hour marathon, the group opened more than 1,500 booster packs and contributed to the longest unboxing live stream video ever. 


The Pokémon Company explained that hundreds of products were unboxed, and over 20,000 cards were shown off during the live stream. The content creators also sported Pokémon Center and other products from the franchise over the course of the event. After the 24-hour mark was reached, the adorable Pikachu showed up and helped the streamers accept the Guinness World Records certificate.

A cool gesture, after this Pokémon Company world record was achieved, is that these thousands of cards have been donated to charities ahead of the holidays, including Bernardo&#x27;s, a UK organization which helps children and families living in poverty. They have been &quot;carefully curated into binders to create incredible collections of Trading Card Game cards,&quot; said the press release.
 
The expansion Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks - just launched earlier this month, and this event was a way to help promote it. It includes the Stellar Tera Pokémon ex, which includes a cool Pikachu with the powerful Topaz Bolt attack. Some cards are themed around the Terarium, a location from The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet. One of the cards includes the Aloolan Exeggutor as a Stellar Tera Pokémon ex as well.


You can get the cards physically or digitally through the TCG Live app. The press release says you&#x27;ll be able to receive in-game bonuses while logging into it.

Is Deadlock free to play?


Screenshot by Destructoid


Yes, Deadlock is free to play. However, you can&#x27;t simply download the game on Steam at this early stage of development. 


Initially, the only way to play Deadlock was to be invited by Valve. This led to an awkward stage where Deadlock was simultaneously one of the most-played games on Steam and not yet officially announced.


Now, you can play Deadlock by receiving an invite from a friend who already has the game. If you&#x27;re not sure, check the game&#x27;s Steam store page, where you can see which of your friends have access to Deadlo…</span>

We&#x27;ve compiled a list of the 8 best games we think you&#x27;ll like if you&#x27;re a fan of Stalker 2, especially if you&#x27;re looking for that survival fix.

DayZ evokes many of the same feelings as Stalker 2, even if the gameplay is considerably different. There&#x27;s a loneliness to the exploration in DayZ, the world inhabited by mindless zombies and the occasional player. Truthfully, there&#x27;s nothing quite like it, and could be a great game to play straight after Stalker 2.

And, with Dynasty Warriors: Origins finally releasing next January, it seems that this iconic franchise is making a much-needed comeback. 


So, what more can we expect after Origins comes out?

Well, Tomohiko Sho, the head of Omega Force and the producer of the game, certainly has an interesting idea. In a recent preview event, he talked to The Gamer and revealed that he dreams of making Musou spin-offs of two huge western movie IPs: Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. &quot;I am interested in making Star Wars Warriors.

Scroll through the eShop any week, and under the new releases section, you are bound to find a Metroidvania, if not several. The genre is packed with so many games that few manage to break out. However, Red Candle Games&#x27; Nine Sols did manage to make a name for itself earlier this year on PC, and now that it has come to Switch, it is clear to see why.
It fuses the intense, precise parrying system seen in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice with satisfying skills, abilities, and upgrades that are all accentuated by strong sound design and visuals. While the worldbuilding and design didn&#x27;t particularly grab us, its combat is enough to make it stand out when compared to its 2024 Metroidvania competition.

The My Nintendo loyalty program is pretty good, right? If you head on over to the rewards section of the service right now, you’ll find a host of interesting goodies to claim should you possess the required number of coins. These include a Nintendo Switch Online 2025 Calendar, a set of Super Mario Bros. embossed art prints, a Mario vs. Donkey Kong smartphone ring, and a Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership pin set. That’s… good, isn’t it?
Yes, it’s good, but it’s not great. And by gum, if you’ve been a fan of Nintendo for a while now, then you’ll know that My Nintendo’s predecessor, Club Nintendo, was often great. In operation from 2002 (region-depending) until 2015, Club Nintendo offered up some of the most incredible, one-of-a-kind products imaginable. A golden Twilight Princess statue, a SNES controller for the Wii, a Year of Luigi coin, multiple CD soundtracks... It really felt like the sky was the limit for Club Nintendo, and we’re saddened that My Nintendo will likely never match its brilliance.

Everyone&#x27;s favourite pink puffball, Kirby, is teaming up with Heinz (you know, the tomato ketchup guys) for a new range of sauces in Japan. Well, that&#x27;s not a sentence we thought we&#x27;d be writing today, but we can&#x27;t say we&#x27;re surprised.
Shared by the official Heinz Twitter account, the Kirby range will be launching in late November with nine designs adorning the front of the packets. There&#x27;s even Balsamic and Sriracha flavour options for those who like their chips with a bit of a kick.

The toughest April Fools&#x27; jokes to swallow are the ones that genuinely get our hopes up, only for it all to come crashing down when reality sets in. April Fools’ Day 2024 saw plenty of enticing fake announcements, but there was one smaller prank nestled among the big hitters that stung just a little bit extra. Developer Inti Creates, known for games like Blaster Master Zero and Azure Striker Gunvolt, took to social media that fateful day to unveil Divine Dynamo Flamefrit: an all-new, top-down, action-adventure, dungeon-crawler game.
Suffice it to say, it left quite the strong impression with its stylish 16-bit graphics, its flashy combat, and, most importantly, its utter devotion to replicating the cheesy aesthetic of &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s-era shonen anime. While the trailer was clearly marked as an April Fools’ Day joke, that didn’t stop fans from letting Inti Creates know that this was a game they wanted to actually play. Fortunately, the developer made it happen. Once just an intricately crafted joke, Divine Dynamo Flamefrit is now out in a fully playable form — and it’s quite the enjoyable little romp.

Omar Cornut, one of the co-founders of developer Lizardcube, has announced his departure from the company after his own aspirations and vision became less aligned with the wider team.
Lizarcube is known for its work on Wonder Boy: The Dragon&#x27;s Trap and Streets of Rage 4, with Cornut and Ben Fiquet kickstarting the company out of a shared love of old Sega licenses. Cornut states &quot;I want to make games differently&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be swimming against the tide&quot;, prompting him to leave Lizardcube in the capable hands of Fiquet and the rest of the team.

Nintendo&#x27;s free mobile app, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, is shutting up shop on 28th November 2024 at 3pm BST / 7am PT / 10am ET. We knew this end date was on the horizon and we told ourselves that it would all be okay with Pocket Camp Complete landing on mobile next month. And yet here we are, having a little cry over a new in-game event called the &#x27;Thank-You Finale&#x27;.
You see, unlike Nintendo&#x27;s other apps, where service has ended with little to no fanfare, Pocket Camp&#x27;s &#x27;Thank-You Finale&#x27; is all about saying goodbye to the camp you have been building over the last seven years.

In general, though, Summersett says she would love to see &quot;more playable Zelda&quot; and is happy fans of the princess got Echoes of Wisdom.

Which is a shame, as it’s a very, very good gamepad, including for PC playage. Consider these Black Friday week deals, then, as a rare opportunity to secure yourself said good gamepad without acquiescing to Sony’s stubbornness: it’s down to £40 in the UK and $54 in the US.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re playing a &quot;PS1-style&quot; game these days, odds are it&#x27;s a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io&#x27;s Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside &quot;existential grey&quot; is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It&#x27;s a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

                              <span>Recently, PC games have been gorging themselves silly on our storage space. 160GB for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2? 190GB for God of War Ragnarok? If these games were people they’d stand waiting at the Pizza Hut buffet and nab ten of the twelve slices of Pepperoni Feast as soon as they’re slid under the heatlamps. What to do? For our part, there’s little we can do except upgrade capacity, and there are few better ways to do that on a budget than with the WD Blue SN580. It&#x27;s a cheap yet fast PCIe 4.0 SSD, which the Black Friday sales have knocked down to £47 / $55 for 1TB.

                              <span>Video games in general have a surplus of weapons. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that if I had any freelance budget, I&#x27;d commission somebody to count them up. Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we&#x27;re talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those comparison pages for stars and planets - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game&#x27;s armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. &quot;Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers,&quot; I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

                              <span>Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I&#x27;d rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year&#x27;s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

                              <span>When and where did the Steam demo for horror game New Life first find its way to me? When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. &quot;For who is madder?!&quot; I shout, in a normal and cool manner. &quot;The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!&quot;
And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?

                              <span>A studio led by former Mass Effect director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio&#x27;s closure on LinkedIn yesterday, saying that a &quot;shortfall of funding&quot; was responsible for the decision. They had been making a &quot;multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe&quot;, according to the studio&#x27;s website.

These patches enable large folios for EXT4 on regular files except when using FSVERITY, FSCRYPT, or the journaled data mode. Long story short, these large folio patches can deliver some nice performance gains for both reads and writes...</span>

That&#x27;s mostly the case in the United States and Europe but the global piracy landscape today is significantly bigger. According to broadcaster beIN, previously shuttered streaming sites are quickly getting back in the game.

                              <span>Murder on the Point-and-Click Express.
It&#x27;s a story you&#x27;ve probably heard before: there&#x27;s a detective, a rich, old heiress with an amended will, and an assembled group of people all hoping to benefit from it. And then, as these stories usually do, it ends in murder. On a train! But don&#x27;t be fooled by the plentiful Agatha Christie-isms: this work of whodunnitry is wholly unique while paying tribute to its influences, and may even be one of our favourite modern point-and-clicks.
In the astoundingly well-named Loco Motive, you play as three separate characters – Arthur, a paperwork-loving estate attorney; Herman Merman, a crime novel-author-turned-detective; and Diana, a spy and bounty hunter working for the Inland Revenue Service, which we really hope isn&#x27;t a real thing. These three are your guides as you try to piece together the mysterious and sudden murder of a rich matriarch on a train through a series of goofy, absurd item combinations, interspersed with plot twists, reveals, and comedic cutscenes.

Piggyback, the company behind the official guides for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, has announced that it is once again teaming up with Nintendo on another release. But this is no guide. It&#x27;s a Metroid Prime art book.

                              <span>Many are the horror games that involve you going down. Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you&#x27;re talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn&#x27;t really matter, because you don&#x27;t have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

                              <span>I’ve always liked the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro mouse, a lightweight wireless version of the equally comfortable and responsive Basilisk V3. Yet it’s usually been just a few tenners too expensive for me to say &quot;You, RPS reader, buy this&quot;, and since telling people what to buy is around 40% of this job, well, that just leaves a peripheral-shaped hole in my heart.

                              <span>&quot;James, please don’t just make half your Black Friday deal posts about Steam Deck stuff again&quot;, warns a steely-eyed Graham. &quot;I won’t&quot;, I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

                              <span>The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game&#x27;s janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed &quot;A-life&quot; by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to &quot;emergent&quot; moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It&#x27;s just broken.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s &quot;in the grim darkness of the far future…&quot; tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are among the weirdly publisher-specific victims of Windows 11 version 24H2, which by Microsoft’s admission (well spotted, Bleeping Computer) is causing crashes and crap performance in the affected games. Even after, in Outlaws’ case, Ubisoft responded to the complaints with their own patch.

                              <span>Manor Lords developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, has emerged from his keep with news of a forthcoming patch for the medieval city builder. It&#x27;ll add new maps, building upgrades and reworks for various economic systems.
The announcement post is mostly image-based, in keeping with the classic saying that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as the words in question are mostly synonyms for &#x27;hut&#x27;, &#x27;mud&#x27;, &#x27;tree&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27;&quot;.

Literally, that’s what the streets are saying. “It’s good! A bit shonky, though!” opined my postman this morning, enunciating each syllable by yanking the package further from my grasp. “Don’t worry!” I said. “A patch for the FPS is coming next week”. “That’s cheered me right up, that has!

Its compound eyes contract or dim or vanish entirely. Its limbs lengthen, forming contrails from the Arctic to Antarctica (what, did you think those were from planes? Haha. Hahahaha.)

These services do not discriminate, so whether &#x27;customers&#x27; are pirates or just regular people hoping to buy content, everyone is a potential victim. The scam has been running for at least 20 years yet, seemingly out of nowhere, pro site-blocking studies now describe it as a major piracy-related security threat.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

                              <span>That there are more than 100 entire PC games is a revelation as shocking as it is disturbing, but despite recently spending days translating Horace’s sonorous yawps into the list that eventually became our RPS 100, a chill silence recently befell the treehouse when we realised that some of our personal favourites had somehow been excluded. Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo&#x27;s Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard&#x27;s Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element&#x27;s, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

                              <span>The mutant enemies in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it&#x27;s a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it&#x27;s already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

                              <span>Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you&#x27;re slinging is a &quot;solar-powered&quot; pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai&#x27;s debut didn&#x27;t result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp&#x27;s coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

                              <span>Upon some serious soul searching following a little time with the early access build of open world game Vivat Slovakia, I have unfortunately had to admit to myself that it is probably not the GTA 6 killer I was hoping for. This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>Kill The Man In The House is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children&#x27;s book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there&#x27;s a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

                              <span>Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it&#x27;s rubbish, some others think it&#x27;s basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it&#x27;s one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are &quot;incredibly punishing&quot;.

Now there&#x27;s a new patch, apparently Outlaws&#x27; biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

                              <span>I go through this life burdened by the knowledge that I will never be framed for murder on a luxurious, multiple-day train journey. Not for me the thrill of flushing out the true culprit (or culprits???) between visits to the exquisitely upholstered dining car, against the backdrop of passing mountains. The best I can hope for is getting chewed out for hogging the toilet on a crowded commuter train to Leeds.

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor&#x27;s wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

In Avowed, you are the god-touched envoy of a distant emperor, sent to an island realm known as the Living Lands to investigate a mysterious blight. &quot;God-touched&quot;, in this case, means &quot;fungal and a bit mermaidy&quot;. It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

                              <span>Valve have unveiled a new policy about season passes on Steam, which aims to ensure that developers release all the individual DLC involved on time and share adequate details about each DLC pack in advance. It specifies that developers can delay release of a season pass DLC just once, and by no longer than three months. In the event that a developer postpones DLC release by longer than three months, Valve may take such corrective actions as removing the season pass from sale or refunding players.

                              <span>Gang Beasts is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy&#x27;s head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn&#x27;t seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume together in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there&#x27;s a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It&#x27;s nice!

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is out today. As you may have read, it&#x27;s on the buggy side. Buggier than a bucketful of locusts. Buggier than Kafka&#x27;s Metamorphosis. In our S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review, wasteland wanderer James called it &quot;easily the most borked FPS I&#x27;ve played in years&quot;, detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly.

                              <span>Did last week&#x27;s paranormal body-swapper Slitterhead leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you&#x27;ll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you&#x27;re a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.
Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading &quot;DANGER: BUGS&quot;.

First came Longdue, a conspicuously corporate operator who are making an untitled “psychogeographic RPG”. Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

                              <span>In 2015 a flight by Germanwings carrying 144 passengers and six crew crashed into a mountain in the French Alps. Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You&#x27;re piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: &quot;I hope this hurts.&quot;

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn&#x27;t known, as Reflector haven&#x27;t made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, &quot;there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,&quot; the hacker predicted.

                              <span>Vydání Debianu 13 „Trixie“ je naplánováno na rok 2025 a právě probíhá hlasování o výchozím motivu pracovního prostředí. Jonathan Carter oznámil zveřejnění jednotlivých vzhledů a připomněl blížící se termín vydání. I když ještě nemáme oficiální data zmrazení, mohu vás ujistit, že se blíží! A s tím přichází čas vývojového cyklu, kdy je třeba vybrat grafiku pracovní plochy, která bude použita v příštím vydání Debianu, píše Carter.</span>

Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet&#x27;s core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let&#x27;s take a closer look at how things play out.

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

                              <span>Remedy&#x27;s Control 2 will be an &quot;action RPG&quot;, the developers have announced, and while I have already caved and written it up, I&#x27;m not sure this is really news. Wasn&#x27;t the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn&#x27;t every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn&#x27;t have RPG-style elements. No wait, don&#x27;t actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

                              <span>My time with Threshold has been fraught with pain. Five times. Five times I had to restart this psychological horror game because of some game-breaking bug. And yet, I persevered, booting it back up and returning to my government-mandated shift atop a quiet mountain.
Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it&#x27;s time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I&#x27;m back. It&#x27;s worth it.

Due to launch on 21st November, Update 1.3 will deliver &quot;a gargantuan number of improvements, fixes, and some entirely new features&quot;. These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they&#x27;ve shown the campaign a little love as well.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their stinking rat hordes - it builds upon the 2020 game by &quot;[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming&quot;, in the words of the launch announcement release.
We&#x27;ve got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of &quot;machine learning&quot; technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it&#x27;ll devour as you play.

                              <span>A long while ago I wrote about Vampire Survivors-likes needing to stop overwhelming you with visual clutter. I&#x27;ve since played a few games of a similar ilk that don&#x27;t hammer you with a chaos that&#x27;s impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is Bloodshed, an old school FPS take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase &quot;just one more run&quot;.

                              <span>I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I&#x27;ve never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: &quot;ah, that was good.&quot;
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun &#x27;em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

It&#x27;s like the &quot;glass half empty&quot; mindset, but the bartender hasn&#x27;t even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you&#x27;ve wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the &quot;bar&quot;, gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they&#x27;re making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don&#x27;t want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015&#x27;s Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. &quot;A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please,&quot; I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman&#x27;s travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

I hope one day to level up from &quot;bumbling, tumbling and blundering&quot; to &quot;running and jumping&quot;. Perhaps I&#x27;ll even get as far as &quot;speedrunning&quot;. But in the likely event that I plateau at &quot;blundering&quot;, it&#x27;s a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to work out if I&#x27;m keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes&#x27; hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer&#x27;s boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn&#x27;t like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It&#x27;s also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn&#x27;t see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there&#x27;s a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe&#x27;s pre-alpha &quot;prelude&quot;: I&#x27;m keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren&#x27;t encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

Valve&#x27;s given the fairly nondescript trainyard a &quot;full visual overhaul&quot; in Counter-Strike 2, making it &quot;60% cloudier&quot; and changing its layout to encourage more tactical play besides just whipping out the AWP and looking down long, narrow corridors.

                              <span>A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of &quot;hateful or extremist&quot; language and images hosted on Steam&#x27;s community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve &quot;bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards&quot; or risk &quot;intense scrutiny&quot; from the government.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it&#x27;s framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně &quot;zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!&quot; (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A &quot;nevíme jak&quot; je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…</span>

                              <span>A new trend has emerged on YouTube where &#x27;scammy&#x27; channels facing a ban for copyright infringement appear to evade penalties through the use of sexually explicit content. Questions remain, but evidence does suggest that a loophole is being exploited. By avoiding termination for copyright infringement, these channel owners may be able to protect their linked AdSense accounts.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 just turned 20-years-old, and to celebrate Valve updated the game with some new features. They also produced a documetary in which several of its development team look back on their work on the game and its episodic expansions - including the never-released Episode 3.

The documentary includes in-progress footage of the episode in action for the first time, and it shows an ice gun and a new liquid enemy type.

                              <span>Four thousand words of notes. Hoboy. Field of Glory Colon Kingdoms is definitely thought-provoking.
It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the &quot;confused whingeing&quot; subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It&#x27;s part of a &quot;restructuring&quot; that&#x27;ll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it&#x27;s an intentional move that&#x27;ll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

                              <span>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been &#x27;out&#x27; of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as &quot;a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles&quot;. It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

                              <span>2024 has been a pretty rough year for Nintendo-loving emulator fans. At this point it&#x27;s clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can&#x27;t have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo&#x27;s disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

                              <span>Sorry We&#x27;re Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn&#x27;t often into the &#x27;lore&#x27; behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character&#x27;s own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I&#x27;d enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it&#x27;s just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

                              <span>In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say &quot;lol, it me&quot; with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter &quot;ugh, it me&quot; and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

                              <span>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

                              <span>The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap &quot;should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.&quot; But do you?

                              <span>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter Unreal to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They&#x27;ve also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

                              <span>Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a &#x27;Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest&#x27;, which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

                              <span>Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they&#x27;ve turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you&#x27;ll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

                              <span>Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you&#x27;ve made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I&#x27;ve found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

                              <span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&#x27;s premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

                              <span>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

                              <span>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were &quot;born in Chornobyl?&quot; as a play on &quot;were you born in a barn?&quot; whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been &quot;you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?&quot;, because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

                              <span>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as &quot;co-developers&quot; on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

                              <span>After nearly a year of public beta honing, the Nvidia App – Team Green’s new one-stop shop for desktop GPU management – is out in full. Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

                              <span>My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter&#x27;s job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

                              <span>The developers of hero shooter Overwatch 2 must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a &quot;Classic&quot; mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

As reported by Polygon, that&#x27;s an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of The Crew. They&#x27;re suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the racing game&#x27;s servers, rendering it unplayable.

                              <span>Sin enjoyed the roguelike stylings of Dungeons of Blood and Dream when she played it in early access back in July, calling it a “baffling, bizarre thing that lives on the border of janky, retro, and punk”. As of yesterday, it’s now out for realsies, promising psychedelic dungeon crawling, the stabbing of assorted gribblies, and lots of little details that make you go “ooo, that’s nice. I’m glad they put that in there.”

                              <span>The developers who remade Half-Life as Black Mesa are working on a new roguelite co-op shooter. It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In Rogue Point the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth. Which is where your team of renegade shooterists come in. They don&#x27;t want to win this contest, they just want everyone else to lose.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)</span>

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.
