These might be some of the more interesting characters to incorporate into an arena-fighter like Cursed Clash if for no other reason than their abilities are more than meet the eye.




In the case of Maki Zen’in, she canonically doesn’t have much — if any — cursed energy. So, she&#x27; relies &#x27;ll rely on her cursed tool polearm Playful Cloud to dish out as much damage as possible. It looks like she chains together ground and aerial combos to give her the upper hand in tense combat.


Toge Inumaki uses cursed speech, meaning he has opted to only ever speak in rice ball ingredients such as “salmon,” “salted roe,” and “…</span>

                              <span>KarmaZoo, a cooperative platformer party game developed by Pastagames and published by Devolver Digital has set a release date for November 14. In this unorthodox multiplayer experience, players seem to be encouraged to diminish the ego and prioritize their friends — or, in some cases, perfect strangers.




In the release date announcement trailer, it looks like this game is predominantly speed-based in the sense that players will be put into a course where they must make it to the finish line. But unlike most games of this archetype, KarmaZoo encourages selfless actions that benefit the collective over the self. 


For example, one scenario might be a large ravine that is impossible to cross, with spikes at the bottom. If you were to jump into the ravine, your demise would trigger a tombstone to fall, providing your fellow players a stepping stone to cross it. In exchange for your noble sacrifice, you’d earn extra rewards at the end of the round. But, it’s not all about self-sacrifice — any positive action that benefits the team can be recognized and rewarded. So, it’s not a competition. It’s more a collaboration than anything else.


I say all that, but for those readers who’re itching to beat their friends in Karma-based minigames, there will be a competitive mode added to the final release. So, no matter if you’re feeling like working with a group of friends (or strangers), or if you want some brutal competition, KarmaZoo has you covered.


Based on the trailer, the game adopts this nostalgic, pixel-based art style that reminds me of indie games such as VVVVVV. I do worry that, thanks to the incredibly small sprite size for these characters, it’ll be a difficult one for those of us with poor eyesight. But, it might not be as big a deal in the game itself.


KarmaZoo is set for release on November 14, and will be available for the Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.

                              <span>Detective Pikachu isn&#x27;t the only live-action Pokemon offshoot in existence. There&#x27;s also a Japanese TV series on the way, but don&#x27;t expect to see more CG-animated Pokémon waltzing about in this one. Per Crunchyroll news, Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde — Pack Your Pockets with Adventure, or PokéTsume for short —is a Pokemon-inspired drama that aims to mine a very specific type of nostalgia. In particular, nostalgia aimed at folks who grew up on the original Game Boy and the first Pokemon games. 


Madoka Akagi is one such person, and she&#x27;s about to rediscover the adventures she loved as a child. She&#x27;s currently moving to Tokyo to pursue her ambitions as a creator, and receives something very special during the move. Her family gives her a Game Boy Pocket and Pokemon Red as a parting gift. Since she grew up playing Pokemon, she&#x27;s immediately ready to dive back into its world. You can hear those familiar sounds and watch as her work life intermingles with her rekindled love for &#x27;Mon in the first trailer for the drama. 




Once a game freak


The actor in the role of Madoka is Nanase Nishino. She&#x27;s played roles like Hiromi in Shin Kamen Rider, but she has an even better qualification for PokéTsume. She&#x27;s a Pokémon fan in real life, so playing someone like Madoka should come naturally. 


PokéTsume was created as a collaboration between Pokémon Inc. and TV Tokyo. Its premiere is right around the corner as part of the network&#x27;s MokuDora24 slot on October 19. 


Beyond this, there&#x27;s also that live-action Pokemon series in the works at Netflix and a Detective Pikachu sequel. It&#x27;s been a while since we heard anything about either, so maybe we&#x27;re better off firing up our Game Boys like Madoka in the meantime.

                              <span>Blizzard hosted the first of their two Devstreams regarding the upcoming Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of the Blood, yesterday. And, I have to say...it was actually pretty good. In the trove of quality-of-life changes and enhancements coming to the ARPG, a buff to the drop rate of Uber Uniques was mentioned. Diablo Designer Joe Shely followed up on Twitter afterward confirming the buffed drop rate.




Promising changes coming to Season of Blood


In the slide, Shely references, it mentions that players will have &quot;Greater access to Uber Uniques via Uber Duriel&quot;. Duriel is the final of the five new bosses coming in Season 2. Players will need to farm materials from earlier bosses in order to spawn him. In the tweet, Shely states that Uber Uniques will still be rare. But players who farm Uber Duriel are going to see them eventually. In its current form, there&#x27;s no way to farm Uber Uniques and even players who spend hundreds of hours farming a season aren&#x27;t likely to see them drop.


This is an immensely positive change for Diablo 4, and makes me hopeful about future development. The ability to actually target farm Uber Uniques, even if they still have a rare drop, at least gives players a goal. Blizzard has a history of refusing to change their philosophy on certain mechanics like drop rates. But the decision to make a big change like this is a big improvement over previous Blizzard titles.


I&#x27;m still reserving my overall judgment for the fate of Season 2 because that will depend a lot on the new content of the season. But a lot of the changes that were announced simply make the game better. Blizzard plans to support Diablo 4 for years, so we&#x27;re still very early on its lifecycle. If it plans to stand with other long-lasting ARPG&#x27;s like Diablo 2: Resurrected, Diablo 3, and Path of Exile, updates like this are a big part of it.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches on October 17 on all platforms.

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 has reached a new milestone by selling 25 million copies, with 3 million copies sold in the first week of launch. CD Projekt Red announced this today along with some interesting statistics regarding the IP and the studio&#x27;s other games. 




An image reveals what platforms players are enjoying the game&#x27;s latest DLC, Phantom Liberty, on. The majority of Phantom Liberty&#x27;s units have been sold on PC. Of the 86% on the platform, 10% are playing on GOG.com. There are 13% on Xbox Series X/S, and the remaining 20% are on PS5. These are all excellent numbers for CD Projekt Red, especially when one remembers the rocky launch the game had which eventually led to it being pulled off the PS Store. 


Some of the stats reveal what a mammoth task it was to resurrect the game. Phantom Liberty required 275 million PLN (almost $63 million) for direct production expenditure and 95 million PLN in marketing costs (almost $22 million). It took 360 developers from CD Projekt Red, and there were 3,600 people engaged in the project. 


Looking more widely, the studio also reveals that it has sold 100 million copies across its franchises, including The Witcher. This puts the studio in a good position as it prepares to expand its franchises with a new The Witcher game. 


CD Projekt Red&#x27;s continued investment into Cyberpunk has clearly paid off, and although the studio has stated that Phantom Liberty is the last major DLC, it is not done with the IP just yet. It has also been announced that a live-action project is in the works in collaboration with Anonymous Content.

                              <span>It has dredged up a release date.


 Black Salt Games and Team17 have announced that the first expansion DLC for the nautical horror game Dredge is set to release for all platforms on November 16, 2023. The Pale Reach will have sailors exploring a frozen a new “icy expanse.”


The Pale Reach adds a new arctic biome. You’re tasked with following in the footsteps of a doomed expedition. I’ve read At the Mountain of Madness. I know exactly how this is going to turn out. In this new region is 11 new species of aquatic life, as well as their twisted aberrant alternatives.


That’s all I got. It’s more Dredge. Here’s the trailer:




I reviewed Dredge when it launched back in March. I wasn’t too impressed. I summed it up by saying, “It’s hardly condemning to say, ‘this fishing game is about fishing.’ I’m mostly trying to stress that, ‘No, this is really about fishing.’” Because, like, it looks like a horror game – and it is – but it’s less unraveling a mystery and more selling the catch of the day. I felt that the fishing got a bit repetitive over time, and everything around it was a bit shallow.


I&#x27;m not really certain if The Pale Reach expansion is going to do anything to fix that, but a lot of people enjoyed Dredge for what it was, so that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.


The Pale Reach is coming to Dredge on November 16, 2023. It will run you a reasonable $5.99.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red, the developer of Cyberpunk 2077, has announced the studio will be partnering with Anonymous Content to produce a live-action “project” set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Anonymous Content is most known for producing works such as True Detective and Mr. Robot, but its catalog is overflowing with series such as Saint X, Shantaram, and The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.


It is currently unknown what form this live-action Cyberpunk story would take, but considering CD Projekt Red is working closely with Anonymous Content Studios’ head of television Garret Kemble, director of development Ryan Schwartz, and CCO David Levine, it would make sense to be a series, rather than a film on the big screen.


What we do know is that this will be a brand new story in the Cyberpunk universe, not an adaptation. The announcement by CD Projekt Red says “the new project is at an early development stage and has currently commenced searching for a screenwriter to tell a brand-new story set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.” While Kemble, Schwartz, Levine, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully will be producing, “the project will be developed in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.”


If this series or film or whatever this project manifests as can be as well made as the anime adaptation, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, it could be an exceptional experience. Because it’s a new story and not a direct adaptation, the project already sounds like a winner. Though it’d be nice if they were able to offer Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba a spot on the cast, even if they’re just walk-on cameos.

                              <span>Upcoming gothic-themed title The Last Faith will release worldwide on November 15. The dark and visceral Metroidvania and Soulslike hybrid from developer Kumi Souls focuses on methodical combat in a dark yet beautiful 2D world. As has become standard in the genre, The Last Faith will feature intense boss fights that are challenging yet rewarding. Of course you can draw parallels to games like Dark Souls. But, with the 2D art style, it actually reminds me a lot of Salt and Sanctuary or Blasphemous 2.




Welcome to Mythringal


Wow, what a trailer. It looks like it will be a pretty intense venture through the city of Mythringal. As seen in the trailer, The Last Faith gives players access to an arsenal of melee weapons, spells, and even firearms. The bosses look diverse and intricate in their attack patterns. It&#x27;s par for the course for these kind of games, but I already know I&#x27;ll be getting frustrated during some of these fights. In a good way, of course.


Those wanting to check out The Last Faith beforehand can access an extended demo that is available now on Steam. In the demo, players can experience early parts of The Last Faith.


The last Faith releases digitally worldwide on November 15 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Ziggurat Interactive and Limited Run Games have announced that their two-for-one classic pack, A Boy and His Blob Retro Collection will release on Switch, PS4, and PS5 on October 17, 2023. A PC version is in the works for a later date.


A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia was released on the NES in 1990, and it’s an odd one for the time period. In a lot of ways, it feels more like an early home computer game than a late NES title. It’s very freeform, and the world itself is like a very big puzzle. It takes a while to acclimate to it, and then you’ll likely need a few attempts at the game to finally see the end. It’s not impossible. It’s just a little overwhelming and unforgiving.


The collection also includes The Rescue of Blobette (also known as David Crane’s The Rescue of Blobette Starring a Boy and His Blob) is very similar but with smaller flipscreens and fewer colors.




Both games were developed by the legendary David Crane, who is best known for his work in Pitfall. The two games have their charm, but I don’t think they’re the best from the developer. Nonetheless, they’re unique, which counts for something.


Both games have been converted to Limited Run Games’ proprietary Carbon Engine. The Collection was available physically on PS4, PS5, and Switch, as well as separately as NES and GameBoy reissues, but those sold out. If you missed them, here’s your chance to get them digitally.


A Boy and His Blob Retro Collection releases digitally on Switch, PS4, and PS5 on October 17, 2023. Release for the PC version is unannounced.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that another one of its franchises will be getting a Lego theme. This time around it&#x27;s Animal Crossing, and we&#x27;ve gotten a sneak peek that&#x27;s criminally cute. It appears that the set will feature at least eight figurines, and all the fan favorites are there including Rosie, Bunnie, Marshal, Kappa, Fauna, Julian, Isabella, and Tom Nook.




There&#x27;s been no release date or prices yet, and we haven&#x27;t gotten a look at what sets will be coming our way. However, Lego leaker @Falconbricks, who had made a post predicting an Animal Crossing Lego theme in August, also claims that 5 sets will be released in March 2024. 


As of June 2023, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has sold over 42 million copies, so there&#x27;s no shortage of fans to ensure these fly off shelves. This isn&#x27;t the only reason Animal Crossing fans can get excited, as this month brings New Horizons&#x27; Halloween event that is held every year. 


Is Animal Crossing not your thing? There have been plenty of Lego Super Mario sets released since 2020, including the Larry&#x27;s and Morton’s Airships Expansion Set which hit stores this year.

                              <span>The first word I think of, looking back on my first 20 turns of Solium Infernum, is anxiety. With all of Hell laid out before me, and so many ways to seize it for myself, I had to make the most of every turn and those precious two actions I could take. But that&#x27;s the appeal of Solium Infernum, a remake of a classic strategy game from Armello creators League of Geeks; it offers a plethora of options but limits their frequency, making each turn a hellish clash of subterfuge, cunning, and two-faced lies.


In the annals of PC cult-classics, Solium Infernum is as much hidden as it is a gem. This strategy game from Victor J. Davis and Cryptic Comet certainly inspired some love when it first hit the scene in 2009. It picked up steam as a darling among bloggers at the time, even inspiring a parti…</span>

                              <span>The fact that Starfield has been nominated for several awards at the Golden Joystick Awards suggests it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s doing quite well for itself. Of course, it has its faults as any game does, which is why Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s quest director has leaped to its defense.


In a recent post on Twitter, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s own Patrick K. Mills responded to Starfield criticism, in which they insisted they liked the game.




The long and the short of it is, user Synth Potato gave a fairly lengthy assessment of the Bethesda RPG, specifically when it came to the studio&#x27;s Creation Engine. Comparing it to Cyberpunk 2077, the post argues that Starfield is &quot;outdated,&quot;, particularly in light of cutscenes and animations. This has been an ongoing feud of sorts for a few weeks on the Twitter-verse, but now we have an actual response from a CD Projekt Red developer.


It all comes down to design, Mills says


In response to this, Mills argues that Starfield&#x27;s cinematics and animation are &quot;not down to engine so much as it is tools and design.&quot; While they admit they&#x27;re not &quot;an engine guy,&quot; they do go on to say that Bethesda&#x27;s scenes are &quot;staged in a more refined way.&quot;


The post chain goes into further detail, with Mills saying that the developer is &quot;just doing something different with [its] time and that&#x27;s cool.&quot; The thread closes by adding that &quot;not every game can do every thing,&quot; and as such, not all features can be as refined as people would like.


It&#x27;s up to you to decide whether you agree with this or not. For now, Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s quest director at least wants to throw some love Starfield&#x27;s way.

                              <span>Ready for another Pokemon release? It feels like we just got one, right?! Alongside the constant updates for Pokemon Go, Pokemon Unite, Pokemon Masters EX, and the recent Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Teal Mask DLC, we&#x27;re also getting another entry in the Detective Pikachu Returns series on the Switch eShop this week (October 6 to be exact). Given that the first one ended on a cliffhanger, I&#x27;m glad the time has finally come for the sequel to potentially shine.


Beyond the Poke-verse, we have Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, Wargroove 2, Front Mission 2: Remake, and a ton of other stuff that you can check out below coming out on Switch.

                              <span>Silent Hill and Halloween go together like James Sunderland and existential guilt. With Konami&#x27;s iconic horror series returning, many will be wondering when we&#x27;ll get to experience this new era. As it turns out, perhaps to the surprise of no one, Silent Hill: Ascension may be heading to our screens for the spooky season.


That&#x27;s according to a listing on Google Play, which says the interactive mini-series will be premiering on October 31. So, Halloween exactly, it seems.




It should be made clear that, as of writing, the producers and developers of Ascension have not actually confirmed whether this is the date the experience will launch. However, Google Play also doesn&#x27;t say that this is a placeholder date, so this could be the real deal.


Like Bandersnatch, but not


For those who aren&#x27;t aware, Silent Hill: Ascension is an interactive live-action series in which viewers decide on the outcome. It&#x27;s being developed by J. J. Abram&#x27;s Bad Robots Production company, along with Dead by Daylight studio Behavior Interactive and Genvid Entertainment.


The listing on describes it as a thrilling new &quot;streaming service&quot; that &quot;follows multiple main characters from locations around the world tormented by new and terrifying SILENT HILL monsters.&quot;


We were treated to a pretty creepy trailer a few months back. Ascension is essentially a spin-off and, from what we understand so far, could deviate slightly from what we know and love about Silent Hill. However, we&#x27;ll know more as and when the interactive experience airs.


We&#x27;re also still waiting to hear more about Bloober Team&#x27;s remake of Silent Hill 2. There will be many who are looking forward to this modern take on one of the most influential horror games of all time. Equally, there will be those who are skeptical about whether it can do the original justice.

                              <span>Atari has announced that the next in line for Sneakybox’s series of remakes is Berzerk: Recharged. The press release says that it will be released “later this year,” which is a pretty small window of time by development standards.


Designed by Alan McNeil, Berzerk was first released in 1980 in arcades, followed by ports on the Atari 2600, 5200, and Vectrex consoles. It was first published by Stern, but Atari proudly bought back the property during a round of acquisitions this year. 


Something like this was inevitable, as Atari CEO Wade Rosen sounds like a fan. I don’t blame him. I’m not big on that primordial era of video games, but Berzerk is something special. It’s a multidirectional shooter where you navigate mazes and blast robots. You also frequently find yourself accosted by a bizarre smiling face called “Evil Otto” who is indestructible. He’s here to make sure that you keep spending quarters.




Beyond updated graphics and a soundtrack by frequent collaborator Megan McDuffee (River City Girls), Berzerk: Recharged will also upgrade the gameplay with twin-stick controls. You’re put through 20 “hand-crafted” mazes to compete for leaderboard supremacy. There’s also a two-player coop, which is standard for the series.


While Berzerk: Recharged doesn’t have a solid release date, it’s targeting PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Atari VCS. In the meantime, you can satisfy your Evil Otto cravings with Berzerk Enhanced Edition for the actual Atari 2600, which releases on November 17, 2023.

                              <span>In the first of the two planned Devstreams for Diablo 4 Season 2, Blizzard revealed some pretty big changes coming to the ARPG. First, the team discussed the details of Season 2, including its new systems and content. Then a plethora of upcoming changes were discussed, most of which on the surface should improve Diablo 4 in a big way. Near the end, Blizzard casually announced that Diablo 4 would be launching on Steam at the start of Season 2. Overall I&#x27;d say it was a good Devstream. Let&#x27;s go over some of the highlights!




Season of Blood


The second season of Diablo 4, Season of Blood, will go live on October 17 at 1 p.m. ET. The current season, Season of the Malignant, will also end at the same time. Furthermore, Patch 1.2.0 will also go live the same day Season 2 begins. Blizzard has …</span>

                              <span>Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you&#x27;re in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge&#x27;s first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include &quot;1-3 hours of content&quot; and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game&#x27;s publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

                              <span>The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they&#x27;re taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project &quot;in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.&quot; That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there&#x27;s still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They&#x27;ve yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is &quot;set in the world&quot; of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari&#x27;s Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, &quot;bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has teased a collaboration between its Animal Crossing series and Lego. It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn&#x27;t reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, &quot;Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!&quot; The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn&#x27;t the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It&#x27;s been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now. 
Are you going to be picking up any of these Animal Crossing Legos when they release? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn&#x27;t tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news.

Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn&#x27;t list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

The Pale Reach will be bringing a whole new biome to the seven seas of Dredge&#x27;s world, and as the title might suggest, it&#x27;s a white wonderland of ice, sleet, and snow. You should also expect even more monstrosities to be hiding under the chilly ocean waves here.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Jim pleads the case for just a little more Ganondorf action...

The reveal of Tears of the Kingdom&#x27;s Ganondorf has to be one of my favourite all-time moments as a Zelda fan. We all collectively lost our minds over a 0.2-second clip of him shouting and then lost them in a different way altogether when we saw the accompanying key art minutes later — nothing forgives decades of tyranny and bloodshed quite like some killer pecs, after all. I was chuffed to have the gorgeous Gerudo back in my mainline Zelda games and thoroughly grinned throughout Link&#x27;s final battle with him.

Publisher SOEDESCO has announced Guns and Spurs 2 for the Switch, bringing more cowboy action to Nintendo&#x27;s console on November 24th, 2023, just three months after the release of Rockstar&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption.
We&#x27;re not going to lie, the two games look very similar in terms of their overall aesthetic and gameplay, though it&#x27;s probably safe to say that Red Dead Redemption probably enjoyed a much higher development budget. Judging from the trailer alone for Guns and Spurs 2, the animation doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s quite there, and the general scope of the game seems a lot more restrictive.

It&#x27;s time to check out the latest physical charts from Japan, and this time, there are a whole bunch of new releases making up the top ten (well, technically just four split across various platforms, but you get it). Nevertheless, Pikmin 4 is still holding its own at number 5, selling a further 18,307 copies, pushing it ever closer to that 1 million unit milestone.
Otherwise, Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Fate/Samurai Remnant comes in at number 1 on the Switch with 34,728 units sold, while its PS5 and PS4 siblings enter the top ten at numbers 3 and 9 respectively. We&#x27;ve also got Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai at number 2, while the Switch version of EA Sports FC 24 managed to snatch position number 6, coming in ahead of the PS5 and PS4 variants.

2023 has swarmed us with quality games. So many that there aren’t enough hours in the day to play them all — and now, Cocoon has crept onto our screens to buzzing acclaim. Fortunately, if you’re busy as a bee, and can’t dedicate time to a marathon game, this is a nice quick one. Jeppe Carlsen, lead gameplay designer of Inside and Limbo, has teamed up with Geometric and Annapurna to unleash this wonderous puzzler. Those who love a good mind-boggler buggler will enjoy curling up in their cocoons for a few hours with it.
You play as a bug-like creature traversing an alien land, completing puzzles to progress. Sometimes you get a drone-type companion who helps break down fences, though it also gets eaten by certain monsters. Then there are the orbs – Cocoon’s point of difference. Each contains a world you can carry around with you, both forming part of puzzles and containing puzzles within. One orb’s land is filled with prismatic crystals, another contains puddles and reeds, another is a gooey membranous underworld.

A retro collection containing the original NES title A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia and its Game Boy sequel, The Rescue of Princess Blobette, is launching on the Nintendo Switch eShop on October 17th, 2023.
While maintaining the essence of the original games, the new collection will introduce modern quality-of-life enhancements, including filters to change the display&#x27;s appearance, a music player, and save states (very much like Nintendo&#x27;s own Switch Online collection, then, bar the music player). Each game will also contain the US and Japanese releases.

                              <span>Pre-registrations have gone live for Konami&#x27;s Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive drama for mobiles - I know, shush, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll come to PCs eventually - which follows a cast of characters around the world who are being tormented by monsters from the eponymous Town of Woe.
My enthusiasm for Silent Hill these days is approximately that of a dog returning to his vomit (or better, a depressive male protagonist with repressed memories that keep reeling him back to the same, misty high street). There have been so many middling sequels and spin-offs. But somehow, I can&#x27;t let go. And Ascension does sound quite intriguing, not least for being a crowd-sourced storytelling enterprise akin to a massively multiplayer Until Dawn.

                              <span>Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and Starfield&#x27;s launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG&#x27;s next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.


The new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you&#x27;ll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.

                              <span>The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns to one of our recent previous messes to discuss Payday 3. More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man&#x27;s Sky?
We&#x27;ve also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.

                              <span>In The Lamplighters League, three evil factions are gathering the power to seize an apocalyptic tower, and you must stop them by finding and trashing their power bases. They&#x27;ll grow in power the whole time, but you&#x27;ll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who&#x27;ll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment. That&#x27;s a damn shame, because it gets a lot right.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is, so says the Alice B review, &quot;the most enjoyable Assassin’s Creed game for years.&quot; That’s thanks in part to a returning focus on classic AC stealthing in a single, densely detailed city, and this back-to-basics approach extends to the technical side too. Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.
It also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.

Woah there, Dr Grant - what the hell are you talking about? Why, the just-announced Dinolords, of course - a blend of strategy and action-RPG from Northplay and Ghost Ship Publishing, in which you raise troops and build castles to fend off armies of T-Rex-riding Danes. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

Out now on PC, the update spans many other technical fixes and improvements, some of them specific to the recently released Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC.

                              <span>Very much like an assassin sliding a poison needle into your wrist while shaking your hand, Ubisoft have added Denuvo&#x27;s anti-piracy/anti-cheating DRM software to Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage in the game&#x27;s day-one update, aka patch 1.0.2. We&#x27;ve known for a while that the game would use Denuvo, together with the VMProtect software, but what&#x27;s baking the noodles of many players is that the Denuvo functionality has been snuck in after the Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage review embargo, denying critics the chance to assess its impact on the game.

                              <span>Kitfox and Bay12 have struck the earth, manufactured a thousand stone blocks, and laid out a roadmap for the Dwarf Fortress Steam edition&#x27;s Adventure Mode, together with some forthcoming updates for the existing fortress management mode. Adventure Mode, in case you&#x27;ve been living under a rock (which I guess you probably have, if you&#x27;ve been playing Dwarf Fortress), is the open world roguelike RPG element of the game, which lets you roam the enormous realm you&#x27;ve generated and even tour/loot/disturb the unquiet spirits of your own, abandoned fortress. Alas, there&#x27;s no word on a release date for the Steam edition&#x27;s Adventure Mode beyond &quot;not this year&quot;.

Over eight years it&#x27;s alleged the operators generated over €25 million in profits, laundered money through a network of companies, while investing in real estate and other luxuries. Ten men were arrested and a dozen cars plus €100k+ in cash was seized.

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage during a special celebratory event for the franchise&#x27;s 15th anniversary. After several trailers, gameplay videos, and even a Game Informer cover (check out our hub here for exclusive behind-the-scenes content and more), the game is finally out for everyone. 
If you&#x27;ve kept up with Mirage, you know it&#x27;s a bit of a return to the series&#x27; roots. After completing the game, it&#x27;s safe to say that&#x27;s definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late. It feels modern but ditches the RPG mechanics and nature of the open-world games and instead embraces series tradition: a singular city to explore, a focus on stealth and parkour, one-hit assassinations, and more.

The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow.…</span>

As one of the most popular and influential series in video games, Super Mario Bros. must appeal to a wide audience of players across a massive spectrum of skills. The main stages of nearly every Super Mario Bros. game accomplish this daunting feat through balanced level design, innovative gimmicks, and fun challenges that nearly anyone can complete. However, late-game and special stages have traditionally been the place where Nintendo tests the mettle and skill of more veteran players.
Areas like Special Zone in Super Mario World and stages like Champion&#x27;s Road in Super Mario 3D World are just a couple of examples of Nintendo flex…</span>

                              <span>Developer Kumi Souls Games announced its gothic Soulslike metroidvania, The Last Faith, years ago, and last summer, we got a new trailer that indulged in the game&#x27;s pixelated violence. We knew the game was coming late this year, but now it&#x27;s official: The Last Faith hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15. 
Kumi Souls Games announced this release date with a new gameplay trailer that you can watch below: 


If you don&#x27;t want to wait until November 15 to jump into The Last Faith, you can check it out early with a new extended demo that&#x27;s available right now on Steam. Kumi Souls Games says that in it, you can get a taste of Mythringal&#x27;s brutal environment. 
&quot;Often brutal, but always empowering, The Last Faith thrives on merciless and precise combat, with a huge range of custom executions to perform,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Players will unearth a formidable variety of melee weapons, arcane spells, and long-range firearms, allowing them to carve a path in their own style.
&quot;Explore rich, gothic environments in order to piece together the fractured history of Mythringal, and survive intense encounters against swathes of blood-thirsty enemies who will stop at nothing to put an end to Eryk.&quot;
The Last Faith hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 15.

It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. 
Today, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it&#x27;s a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is &quot;driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take&quot; after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. 
Check it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the &#x27;Alters&#x27;,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.&quot; 
11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. 
&quot;Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan&#x27;s determination to survive: I&#x27;ll just do it all by myselves,&quot; the press release reads.

The Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Nintendo ended eShop functionality for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, marking the beginning of the end for these devices. Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. 
More specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. 
As of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.

&quot;In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s announcement reads. &quot;This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.&quot;
Nintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if &quot;an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services&quot; for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. 
The company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that &quot;for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.&quot; 
The fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop.

For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio.

It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.

                              <span>During the October 3 Diablo 4 Devstream about the upcoming Season 2, Diablo Community Manager Adam Fletcher casually revealed that Diablo 4 is coming to Steam. When Season 2, Season of Blood launches on October 17th, players will be able to download and play the ARPG through Steam. Earlier this year another Blizzard title, Overwatch 2, also came to Steam.


According to Fletcher, cross-play and cross-progression will work immediately on day one. Players on Steam and Battle.net will be able to party up and play together seamlessly on the same server. Despite being on the Steam platform, it looks like players will still require a Battle.net account to activate and play. This isn&#x27;t too surprising since most modern-day Blizzard titles are built around the Battle.net network.

Stray Souls takes place in the town of Aspen Falls, where protagonist Daniel has inherited his Grandmother’s house. He renovates the interior and quickly sells it on the booming real estate market to afford his education.


No, I’m joking. The town is full of monsters. Of course it is.




The plot centers around Daniel discovering he’s part of a ritual that was set in motion at his birth. Stray Souls is based on Japanese survival horror games and carries a bit more than a whiff of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. However, it promises “mind-bending puzzles” and a choice-driven narrative. It’s by a small team, but it carries with it the fancy gloss of the Unreal 5 Engine. Plus, it sports the legendary Akira Yamaoka as a guest composer.


I don’t know. The trailers show a lot of what seems familiar. The store blurb also states that its combat features “soulslike precision.” It kind of feels like its selling itself based on the merits of other games, rather than what it brings itself. Nonetheless, I like checking out horror from smaller developers, so it might be worth a look.


Stray Souls is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 25, 2023.

                              <span>Spike Chunsoft announced that Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island will not only be coming to the West, but also that it’s set for release on February 27, 2024. The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island — what a mouthful — will be the 6th game in the mainline Shiren the Wanderer series. The last new entry we saw in this series was The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which came out back in 2016.




The announcement trailer gives insight into what this iteration of Shiren the Wanderer entails. Supposedly, a vast treasure lies in wait in the dungeon of Serpentcoil Island, and who else deserves to claim it than Shiren and Koppa? It’s adopting a chibi-fied, cartoonish aesthetic, which lines up perfectly with the “back to basics” concept the trailer mentions.


As with many other roguelikes, this is a game where you will die (a lot). And, if and when you do die, you also lose everything you have gathered during that run. So strategy and careful movement becomes incredibly important for your survival. Especially with procedurally generated, turn-based dungeons that reset every run. I can see several scenarios playing out in my head that would make me panic beyond imagination.

For those unfamiliar with Shiren the Wanderer, it&#x27;s the main pioneer of the Mystery Dungeon franchise. Western gamers likely know this better for its spinoffs like the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Chocobo Mystery Dungeon series&#x27;. So, if you’ve experienced either of those, you&#x27;ll have a good idea of what to expect here. But if not, you can take the leap of faith when Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2024.

                              <span>Remember Gigantic? Gearbox Publishing certainly does. And it looks like the company is hoping fans of the doomed hero shooter do as well. The company sent emails to some former Gigantic players, inviting them to come together once more for a &quot;limited time throwback event.&quot; 


It seems to have taken some folks by surprise. The humble Gigantic subreddit hummed back to life after players began sharing their invitations. The rise of excitement is somewhat heartwarming to see. It was only two months ago former players were asking: &quot;Does anyone else miss Gigantic?&quot; Well, for a short time, Gigantic will rise from the ashes once more.


&quot;Play Gigantic once more on October 5 at 21:00 CEST - October 7 at 06:00 CEST,&quot; reads the email invite, &quot;and re-live the good old days of playing this beloved strategic hero shooter!&quot;




Is the throwback event setting the stage for a Gigantic comeback?


Gigantic will be playable for a select chosen few starting tomorrow, according to the email. The event will last for only two days, and there are limitations. Beyond being &quot;invite only&quot; to those who received the email, the throwback event can&#x27;t be streamed or recorded — according to an invitee. And this could be the reason: The game may not be the same as fans remember.


According to some invitees, the game is going to come with a suite of updates. The email they received mentioned &quot;Revamped Content&quot; such as a Fortune Card System, a Progression System, loadouts, customization options for weapon skins, and more. The new version apparently includes a Rush Mode, a &quot;fast-paced and action packed&quot; mode for a &quot;simplified&quot; experience.


Does this mean Gearbox is testing the waters for a Gigantic return? Now might be a good time considering its most dangerous rival, Overwatch 2, has been having some struggles.

                              <span>In Fortnite&#x27;s goal to become &quot;multi-game ecosystem&quot; and a creative platform, Fortnite will soon require age rating for all first and third-party content. To make this happen, Epic has formed a partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition, or IARC. If you fashion yourself a creator on Fortnite, this new regulation takes effect starting on November 14.


“When you are ready to publish your island to Fortnite, you will fill out the IARC content rating questionnaire before you submit your island to be published and reviewed by Epic moderators,” the Fortnite Team wrote in a blog post. 


“When the questionnaire is complete, you will receive an age-based IARC rating for the content of your island along with region-specific ratings from IARC-participating rating authorities. These ratings will automatically be applied and prominently displayed prior to access.”


It appears that the IARC will consult regional ratings boards such as the ESRB for North America, PEGI for Europe, ACB for Australia, USK for Germany, and others based on where the player is based. This solution seems to be one designed to protect both creators and audiences — especially younger audiences — to create and consume Fortnite experiences tailor-made for their comfortability level. 


While this regulation doesn’t go into full-effect until November 14, the abovementioned IARC questionnaire goes live on October 16. It&#x27;s to ensure creators have enough time to rate their experiences before the cutoff deadline of — you guessed it — November 14. According to the blog post, any experience left unrated will be delisted on that date, so make sure to abide by the new rule. We’d hate to see the islands you spent so much time and hard work on go dark.

                              <span>Forthright Entertainment has announced that Soma Games’ The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is prepped to re-release consoles on December 1, 2023. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC.


I kind of had to do some digging on this one since the press release omits certain things, like the fact that this is a compilation of three previously released games. The first episode of The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout dropped back in 2018, with the other two following in 2021. Only the first act landed on Xbox One and PS4, with the others arriving on PC. This point is moot, however, because they’ve been delisted from all platforms. Going forward, this is going to be the only way to experience them.


I missed them the first time, which is funny because on my wishlist of games I want to see is a decent game based on Brian Jacques’ Redwall book series. In my youth, I was an avid fan of the series and read through a good chunk of them. If you’re unfamiliar, they’re essential fantasy novels, but instead of Elves and Orcs, it’s mice and rats. They’re joyful and well-written books, even if they tend to be pretty formulaic.




So far, it looks… okay. I don&#x27;t think the games were exactly well-received the first time around, so hopefully, Soma Games did something with the feedback they received. I don’t think the trailer is doing it any favors. Usually, trailers are really heavily edited to show only the most polished slices of gameplay, and this one looks pretty raw. It’s a linear, action-adventure narrative told in three parts. I find it funny that it says, “An adventure for all the family,” directly after showing what looks like conflagrated rats. The books weren’t exactly flowery all the time, so it’s hard to have Redwall without the war.


Gosh, good times.

                              <span>A port for Rockstar&#x27;s famous Red Dead Redemption moseyed onto the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 (but compatible on PS5) in early August. Sadly, the celebratory hoedown came to an abrupt halt when players learned the game would go for $49.99 and run at 30 FPS. And while that don&#x27;t beat all, Rockstar has at least fixed half the issue. The port of Red Dead Redemption got an update that silently added support for 60 FPS, so long as you&#x27;re saddled up with the PS5. I will slow my Western puns for now.


Rockstar released update 1.03 on October 3 and made nary a fuss about the framerate change. The Red Dead Redemption port now has a framerate toggle within its Display menu, allowing PS5 owners to run it at the accepted standard of 60 FPS. Here is the full patch notes for 1.03 via Rockstar Games:



Added an option to enable 60 FPS when played on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility


Added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game


General bug fixes and improvements





Redemption partially arrives for PS5 owners


Fans weren&#x27;t thrilled with the news of the port to say the very least. While its performance on the aging Switch is arguable, it should be easily capable of running at a higher framerate on Sony&#x27;s more powerful machines. The game got a 4K patch and a framerate boost when it went backward compatible on the Xbox One X system in 2018, after all. Fans also weren&#x27;t enthused by its hefty price tag, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick calling it &quot;commercially accurate.&quot; 


Red Dead Redemption is available for download on the Switch and PlayStation 4 for $49.99. It comes with the base game along with the Undead Nightmares DLC.

It was previously announced that PlayStation players would get first dibs on this beta if they pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3, so that goes without repeating. We also got confirmation the beta would eventually make its way to PC and Xbox. Now we have the exact dates and times the multiplayer beta for Modern Warfare 3 will be available.


Minutes to midnight


If you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 on PS4 or PS5, as stated above, you’ll be among the first invited to jump into the multiplayer beta. It should be unlocked for you from October 6 (Friday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


For those PlayStation fans who didn’t pre-order Modern Warfare 3, you’re up next — you can play the beta from October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 10 (Tuesday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


OK — now it’s time for everyone else (kind of). If you pre-ordered the game on PC or Xbox, it’s your turn to take a spin from October 12 (Thursday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. It’s important to note that PlayStation players can also partake during this time.


And lastly, we have a period where the beta will truly be accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of if you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 or not. If this sounds like you, give the multiplayer beta a shot from October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 16 (Monday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. 


We hope that helps you to make the most of this — admittedly short-lived — beta. For more on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, check back with Destructoid in the lead-up to its launch.

                              <span>Five former Ubisoft executives have been arrested following an investigation into sexual assault and harassment at the company. As French publication Libération reports, three of the arrests were made yesterday, and two were made today. 


It is not known yet whether the arrested individuals have been charged, and if so for what. However, it is reported that the arrests come following an investigation of complaints by the Solidaires Informatique union and two victims. According to one of the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers, Maude Beckers, the case encompasses more than individual behavior and also concerns &quot;systemic sexual violence.&quot;


Thus far, only two arrested individuals have been named. The first is former Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, and the other is former editorial vice president Tommy François. Both individuals left Ubisoft in 2020.


Over the years, reports emerged painting a pattern of sexual harassment at Ubisoft. When these allegations began making headlines, Ubisoft claimed it would launch an investigation and take the appropriate disciplinary actions. Since then, many higher-ups have stepped down or been terminated from the company, including those former execs and others. The allegations were enough to also trigger a legal investigation.


In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft said: &quot;&quot;Ubisoft has no knowledge of what has been shared and therefore can&#x27;t comment.&quot;

                              <span>Following our recent preview of Frostpunk 2, 11 bit studios also gave us a roughly 40-minute look at some gameplay from the upcoming sci-fi adventure title The Alters. I have to admit that I knew very little about The Alters beforehand. I remembered the announcement trailer from over a year ago. But while intriguing, that trailer gave no indication of what sort of game The Alters would be. Following the presentation, I certainly have some more questions. But I also know The Alters looks like a creative and interesting title that&#x27;s right up my alley.




Into the Jan-known


The premise of The Alters is definitely a peculiar one. A simple worker, Jan—pronounced &quot;Yahn&quot;—finds himself stranded and alone after crash-landing on a distant planet. Unfortunately for Jan, the planet is in orbit of a…</span>

                              <span>The Serenitea Pot is a system in Genshin Impact that allows players to craft furniture and build their own custom homes and landscapes. Players have come up with plenty of lavish builds, but if you take things too far, you can completely disable your furniture crafting function altogether.


Reddit user u/Enmityaz found this out the hard way. They’ve been on a years-long grind crafting more and more Pine Folding Screens until the game itself eventually told them, “no more.”


How did this happen?


When the Serenitea Pot function first launched in Genshin Impact, this particular piece of furniture was the most resource and space-efficient way to obtain the most points. Players who wanted to maximize their teapot points quickly figured out that crafting dozens of Pine Folding Screens and pa…</span>

                              <span>Fallout: London – the upcoming mod for Fallout 4 – is one of the most ambitious fan-made projects we&#x27;ve seen in some time. Now, as development continues, the team has shared a new update video, which outlines what else is coming.


The progress video on YouTube opens with voice actress Letitia &quot;LetitiaTHELemon&quot; Lemon saying that it&#x27;s getting harder to conceal spoilers as &quot;things start working towards wrapping up.&quot; We also get a glimpse of a ruined version of Bromley, a large town within Greater London.




There&#x27;s some other sneak peeks as well, including some dangerous apex predators that stalk the streets, as well as a gang that&#x27;s been inspired by Peaky Blinders.


Are they suggesting London isn&#x27;t safe?


The mythical creatures that prey on wanders are called Dryads (I think I&#x27;m spelling that correctly) and have a slight appearance of the Spriggan from The Elder Scrolls games. 


As for the Vagabonds, this is a new gang that&#x27;s been added into the Fallout mod that rules Bromley, with a look about them that&#x27;s been lifted from the hit TV show starring Cillian Murphy. They inhabit the Swan and Mitre, a dilapidated pub that&#x27;s been modelled after the real one.


All these teases for Fallout: London have been whetting the appetite of fans who&#x27;ve been keen to play the mod in its final form. However, there&#x27;s still no confirmed release date as of yet, but it sounds like we&#x27;re getting close to one. We know it&#x27;s aiming to launch in 2023, so we could see it arriving within the next couple of months. But that&#x27;s only speculation at this stage.


You can read more about what this Fallout 4 project is actually about on the website. The team is always looking for volunteers to help with the project.

                              <span>Us fans of classic first-person shooters were delighted when the Quake 2 remaster launched recently. A little bit of nostalgia with a dollop of newness to give the iconic game a fresh coat of paint. Now, we&#x27;re in for another treat with a mod that makes id Software&#x27;s 1997 release more violent and harrowing.


As spotted by DSO Gaming, modder SGtMarkIV recently released a &quot;quick gameplay test&quot; of something they&#x27;re calling &quot;Brutal Quake 2.&quot; As the name suggests, this is a mod that ups the violence in Q2, but also tweaks the game in general by adding new ideas.




The footage shows the current work-in-progress. We see that it has the look of Quake 2, only with...well...more brutality. Interestingly enough, we also get to see a map not in the original release or remaster. This one puts the player and other marines in a battlefield, fighting Stroggs as chaos ensues and explosions litter a kind of no man&#x27;s land. Imagine if Johns Romero and Carmack did a Medal of Honor game back in 1997.


Also, it&#x27;s not made in the Quake engine


One thing to note about this footage is that it doesn&#x27;t quite look like a modified version of Q2. Sure, the opening map bears a resemblance to the Outer Base level, but it looks different somehow.


This is because SGtMarkIV is having to make it in GZDoom, the modern toolkit/engine that&#x27;s used to mod the original Doom games. They say that GZDoom can read the models from Quake 2&#x27;s files, which means this mod can run in the Doom engine, but with Quake assets.


We don&#x27;t know the release date for Brutal Quake 2 yet, but given that it&#x27;s coming from the mind that brought us Brutal Doom, expect carnage a-plenty.

                              <span>To paraphrase George Orwell: &quot;If you want a picture of the future, imagine a community of gamers modifying Skyrim... forever.&quot; Bethesda&#x27;s epic RPG has been modded to death, but none hit quite the same as this one that allows NPCs to break wind.


Nexus Mods user JobiWanUK (thanks, PC Gamer—no really... thank you) brings flatulence to the fantasy world of Tamriel. Not only does this mod give a new voice to the denizens of Skyrim (or at least their asses), it also implements realistic reactions for that added dose of fart-y immersion.




We&#x27;re also treated to a full eight and half minute video showcasing what happens when an NPC lets one rip in Skyrim. We get everything from laughter to disgust to angry requests that one leave the vicinity. One guard even offers their fart to the player as a kind of windy gift.


It&#x27;s a lot more in-depth than you might think


It&#x27;s not just adult NPCs and guards, either. Children can also let loose their own pint-sized butt guffaws. As can dogs, horses, and even goats.


The mod description and video say that there are different farts for different occasions. For example, there are ones for when someone is sat down or when they&#x27;re asleep. There are even silent farts, for god&#x27;s sake!


You can also customize how often you get to experience NPCs cutting the cheese. It might be you want to be amused every hour or you don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s just once a day. You can even disable the sleep farts or the ones emitted by animals.


For all its faults and bugs, Skyrim definitely continues to be a breath of fresh air thanks to the modding community. Actually, perhaps &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; is not an appropriate term to use in this context.

                              <span>Another Crab’s Treasure hooked me with its underwater Soulslike premise and cutesy charm. But once you take a closer look at the game’s polluted ocean, filled with plastic shells and weapons, the comparisons to Dark Souls get a little clearer. This is a quiet and kinda melancholy post-apocalypse. We can now find out whether the crustaceans lean on cuteness or sadness more in the game’s new demo, released just yesterday.

                              <span>Brian Jacques&#x27; Redwall books were my greatest obsession between the ages of approximately eight and 12-years-old. They&#x27;re sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn&#x27;t get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.
Fast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here&#x27;s a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.

I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too surprised, considering that timeline flowcharts are rare and that I did illustrate t&#x27;other with multiple screenshots of Kazuma Kiryu smashing men with bicycles. Now if Kiryu had been jumping between timelines... ah, we can&#x27;t speculate, that&#x27;s not scientific. This week, I ask you to choose between cutting something unnecessary and adding something unnecessary. What&#x27;s better: quick restarts, or a diegetic HUD?

                              <span>Many are the horror games that haunt the dark, but it takes a real gift for creepy-crawlies to pull off a horror game that&#x27;s set in the light. I&#x27;m not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it&#x27;s certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. 


It&#x27;s a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there&#x27;s that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character&#x27;s world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story. The game is out today, and I&#x27;ve got some thoughts ahead of a possible review.

                              <span>What exactly is The Alters? It&#x27;s a question I&#x27;ve been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we&#x27;ve had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn&#x27;t really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we&#x27;ve heard precious little about it since. 
Happily, I&#x27;ve now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you&#x27;ll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that&#x27;s slowly enveloping the planet. You&#x27;ll also be venturing out onto the planet&#x27;s surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there&#x27;s the fact that, well, you&#x27;re all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you&#x27;d done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It&#x27;s a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here&#x27;s everything I learned.

                              <span>Five former Ubisoft employees, including former chief creative officer Serge Hascoët and former editoral head Tommy François, have been taken into custody by French police with regard to allegations of sexual misconduct during their time at the publisher. That&#x27;s according to an article in French newspaper Libération (via Eurogamer) which echoes allegations from French videogame union Solidaires Informatique Jeu Vidéo, posted on Xitter just this morning.

                              <span>After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don&#x27;t take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won&#x27;t seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO&#x27;s movement and gunplay.
Still, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I&#x27;m confident Valve have an FPS that&#x27;ll supersede CS:GO in time.

Shortly after announcing plans to make the four-player PvE shooter less online-dependent, the developers have revealed that they&#x27;re also reworking Payday 3&#x27;s much-reviled progression system.

                              <span>I&#x27;m close to being whatever the Assassin&#x27;s Creed equivalent of a Pokémon genwunner is. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.
Assassin&#x27;s Creed hasn&#x27;t been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it&#x27;s more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.

There&#x27;s a lot to sift through there, which we&#x27;ll get into next week, but we also found time towards the finish for some off-the-cuff chinwaggery about dream 4X or strategy game projects. What would the Oxide team make, if they didn&#x27;t have to worry about budget, audience expectations or any of the other commercial factors that guide the creation of videogames? The answers may surprise you. They might also make you hungry.

                              <span>The jump hasn&#x27;t been smooth.
The Dragon Quest series is no stranger to spin-off titles, but few are as confusing as Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai. This action RPG is based on an anime adaptation of a manga based on the world of Dragon Quest, but it is never clear who the game is designed to appeal to. The few things it does well are buried under an avalanche of unengaging cutscenes that go on too long and simply don’t do the story they’re telling justice.
That isn’t to say that there aren’t some glimmers of hope hidden in this game’s runtime. The combat, for example, is competently designed if unimaginative in its implementation; characters have a basic attack, plus a selection of powers that they can unleash to deal more damage or to heal their allies.

                              <span>Na Kickstarteru běží kampaň na mobilní telefon Murena 2 vybavený /e/OS. Novinka nabídne lepší ARM, 8GB RAM, 128GB flash úložiště (plus microSDXC slot) či celosvětovou konektivitu a až 64Mpix foťák či celosvětové 4G/LTE. Vedle kompletně odgoogleného systému /e/OS navíc přinese dva hardwarové vypínače, kdy jeden odpojí telefon od všech sítí a druhý fyzicky vypíná kamerky a mikrofony.</span>

                              <span>When I was a computer science student, I developed a messaging app called HYPE with a few of my (more-talented) peers. It worked really well, and we even used it to talk during lectures, but of course we never released it out into the world and after leaving uni it was abandoned. Years later, I saw the brand called HYTE and my immediate reaction was &quot;They stole our idea!&quot;
Of course, my reading comprehension is poor, and HYTE - the iBuyPower PC case company - is unrelated to my unreleased, unannounced Linux-based chat app. 
And so it falls to me to tell you that if you don&#x27;t have a knee-jerk reaction to four-letter words that look like acronyms but aren&#x27;t, and you like small PC cases, you might be interested in this US deal for the HYTE Revolt 3. 
This critically-acclaimed Mini ITX PC case is down to $112 at Newegg or Ebay, a cut below its regular price of $200 and MSRP of $250. $112 is a bloody brilliant price for this case, especially as it comes with a pre-fitted 700W 80+ Gold SFX power supply.

                              <span>Lexar has been making flash storage since 1996 - in fact, their &#x27;JumpDrive&#x27; USB sticks were synonymous with the format for a decade or more - but over the past few years they&#x27;ve switched to producing high-end NVMe SSDs, including our current best cheap PCIe 4.0 SSD pick: the Lexar NM790. 
Today you can pick up the massive 4TB size of this high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD for just £170.97, a nice discount from the next-best price (Amazon, £187) and a sizeable departure from its original UK RRP (£199) by using code TECHDEAL10 at the checkout.

Today you can pick up one of my favourites from their collection, the SK652, at a decent £15 discount from Scan in the UK. That brings the price of this low-profile, full-size mechanical keyboard to £35, quite a fair price for a keyboard of this size and quality - especially when you get a free XXL mousepad thrown in for free.

If you&#x27;re not a Newegg fan, the card is also available at Amazon for $909.99.

                              <span>I&#x27;m tempted to leave it at the headline and direct you to the comments - it&#x27;s after five, you know, I&#x27;m usually in the bath by now - but I&#x27;m supposed to be some kind of &quot;professional writer&quot;, so I guess I&#x27;ll waffle for a few paragraphs. Activision have put up a trailer for nu-Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s multiplayer, ahead of a full live reveal at the Call of Duty: Next event on 5th October. I caught the news on a social feed somewhere, went hunting for the Youtube version and, much to my distress, managed to dig up the multiplayer premiere for the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in 2011 - almost 12 years ago. 


Rather than just posting the correct video and going off to cry about my advancing seniority, I&#x27;m brazenly posting both so you can trace the evolution (or not) of this shootiest of first-person shooter franchises. It&#x27;s bizarre to think of any game series being this venerable, and changing so much while remaining the same.

In his RPS review, Ed Thorn described it as &quot;an action-RPG that wraps what could&#x27;ve been a wonderfully realised Gotham universe in a tired, slapdash mix of meaningless numbers and loot.&quot; I reviewed it myself as a freelancer and can&#x27;t disagree with his verdict. Game ain&#x27;t great. But I find myself itching to download and revisit this muddled open world contender all the same.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fan of the modern Bethesda RPG, having spent nearly 100 hours with Fallout 4 - which, for me, is a lot more time than I&#x27;m usually willing to give up. My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer&#x27;s walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion&#x27;s warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.
If I don&#x27;t have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don&#x27;t really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield&#x27;s adventuring forces me indoors and it&#x27;s a shame.

                              <span>Even if you&#x27;re not running after members of the royal family with a camera strapped to your big posh noggin, I think basically everyone loves trains, being as they are big magical people movers that can chugga-chug you over an entire country. And not just people! As represented in the lovely voxel maps of puzzle game Station To Station, trains carry freight. Cheese, furniture, steel girders - everything a growing city needs! Laying the rails that connect all of your production chains is, as the UK government will no doubt be quick to tell you, an often-complex affair. But when you get it right in Station To Station you&#x27;re rewarded by an already beautiful game becoming prettier.

The new patch reverts companion behaviour to their pre-Patch 3 behaviour, for a less frustrating RPG experience. In even more momentous tidings, it re-shaves that cat everybody loves. Ah, videogames.

                              <span>Envision Entertainment have released a demo for rustic city-builder Pioneers of Pagonia, and as they say in Manchester, by &#x27;eck it&#x27;s gorgeous. Designed by Volker Wertich, one of the original creators of The Settlers, the new village &#x27;em up puts you in charge of medieval tribes scattered around an almost eerily scenic island chain. 


It&#x27;s all about the little touches: check out those azure windmill blades, flickering in the breeze! And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god. But let&#x27;s not do that. Let&#x27;s play the demo instead. It gives you three maps, and lands ahead of the game&#x27;s early access launch on 13th December.

There are also fixes for a shader compilation bug that may, nonetheless, still exist for AMD GPUs when playing this latest iteration of the developer&#x27;s free-to-play team and objective-based shooter. Many of the larger issues returning players have, such as the absence of Mac support, are yet to be addressed.

                              <span>The biggest hindrance for using Intel Arc Graphics for Linux gaming has been the lack of Vulkan sparse support as needed for running many newer Windows DirectX 12 games atop Valve&#x27;s Steam Play with Proton using VKD3D-Proton. Intel recently did implement Vulkan sparse support for ANV in Mesa 23.3 but it only works with their yet-to-be-upstreamed and still-experimental Xe kernel driver. But now Intel Linux graphics driver engineers have managed to pull off a solution for getting the sparse resources supported while using the existing i915 kernel DRM driver...</span>

I enjoyed my time so much that I was upset when I had to relinquish the controller at the end of my demo session. Thankfully, as part of our cover story for our latest issue, I was able to get a lot more time with Super Mario Bros. Wonder. While a lot of that time was spent further exploring the levels I had already played, I was also the first to experience three courses that appeared as part of the Super Mario Bros. Wonder-focused Nintendo Direct in late August.

In the 11 years since the last 2D game launched, we&#x27;ve received multiple re-releases, two Super Mario Maker titles, two mainline 3D titles, and even a mobile auto-runner. After nearly two decades of the New Super Mario Bros. series dominating the 2D side of the iconic franchise, Super Mario Bros. Wonder represents a new era for the Mushroom Kingdom crew. To celebrate the impending release of this new 2D adventure on Switch, Super Mario Bros. Wonder graces the cover of our latest issue of Game Informer.

                              <span>Earlier this year, developer Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros. Games revealed that it was bringing its Batman: Arkham trilogy to the Switch this fall. This collection does not include Batman: Arkham Origins (a great game), which was developed by Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal. The Batman: Arkham Trilogy, as the Switch collection is called, was due out this month on October 13 but has now been delayed to December. 
More specifically, Batman: Arkham Trilogy hits Swtich on December 1. As for why, the team says more time is needed on its development. 
&quot;More time is needed to bring players the best possible experience on Nintendo Switch,&quot; Rocksteady&#x27;s statement on Twitter reads. &quot;We apologize to fans who are excited to play this version of the trilogy. Thank you for your patience.&quot;

The layoffs reportedly began last week, according to two of Kotaku&#x27;s sources and various departments, from art to production, were hit. The majority of those laid off were in Naughty Dog&#x27;s quality assurance testing department. 
The 25 contract developers laid off were part of a downsizing at the studio, but Kotaku reports that full-time staff do not appear to be affected. The publication&#x27;s sources say severance is not being offered to those laid off and those affected (as well as those still working at Naughty Dog) are &quot;being pressured to keep the news quiet.&quot;

                              <span>The Forest Cathedral is an environmental thriller that hit Xbox Series X/S and PC earlier this year in March. Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. 
For the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson&#x27;s investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is &quot;a dramatic reimagining of Carson&#x27;s environmental science book, Silent Spring.&quot; 
You can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players &quot;will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.&quot; 

As far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the &quot;Little Man&quot; inside the 2D world of Rachel&#x27;s scanning tools. It&#x27;s in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.
The Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man is almost here. Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes&#x27; latest adventure. 
The trailer is CGI and it&#x27;s gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. 
Check it out for yourself in the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 trailer below: 


As you can see, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. 
In the meantime, read about how Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that.

                              <span>Ivar Hill and Slipgate&#x27;s Core Decay is a Deus Ex and System Shock-flavoured immersive sim that&#x27;s all about the ABCs. A, of course, stands for Attacking by means of things like energy rifles, electro-batons and shotguns. B is for Back-stabbing, referring to the stealthy player who may stack objects so as to clamber into vents, and whack guards deftly in the noggin to escape detection.
And C is for Conversing, referring to the act of wooing civilians - who thus far seem miraculously unbothered by your menacing hooded appearance and sepulchral accent - so as to procure door codes and the location of keycards. You can see all these approaches in the game&#x27;s new trailer, below.

Never one to say no to a bout of space strategy, I fired up a preview key over the weekend, and while I wouldn&#x27;t say my pulse has jumped to hyperspace, I&#x27;m certainly enthused.

                              <span>Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is both too hard to say and weirdly close to the most recent Prime Day. And yet, as expected, it’s set to be stuffed senseless with computer kit; there are already dozens of offers on SSDs, gaming mice and keyboards, and laptops ahead of the main event on October 10th-11th. Also: loads more. This guide to the best early Prime Big Deal Days PC gaming deals (urgh, see?) will pick out the highlights for your consuming convenience.
The majorest of major disclaimers: these early deals aren’t yet subject to the defining rule of Prime Big Deal Days, specifically that its juciest savings will only be for Prime members. In other words, any deals on this list, right now, are available to everyone.

This week, my eye has been caught by retro-styled adventure games and city-builders, phenomenally cool fishing rod violence, and some sort of horrible sentient milk glands. Check out all these attractive and interesting indie games!

                              <span>In the frozen hellscape of Frostpunk, you eked out your existence in hours and days, clinging to your heat- and life-giving generator at the centre of your fledgling city like there was literally no tomorrow. In 11 bit Studio&#x27;s forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday&#x27;s news. Now you&#x27;re dealing with &quot;what happens when you survive the un-survivable,&quot; as the game&#x27;s co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year&#x27;s Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.
&quot;If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room,&quot; says Stokalski. &quot;And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It&#x27;s difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you&#x27;ll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices.&quot;

                              <span>Ion Fury: Aftershock, an expansion pack for Voidpoint&#x27;s retro FPS featuring new weapons, enemies and game modes, launches today 2nd October 2023, and there&#x27;s a trailer below awaiting your fervent appreciation.
Well, assuming you&#x27;re not Matt Cox - in our review of the main game, he deemed it an experience in which &quot;old-school decisions too often trump good ones&quot; and  &quot;a blast from a past I never lived through&quot;, concluding that &quot;Ion&#x27;s tongue might be in its cheek, but I&#x27;ve got little interest in what it&#x27;s saying.&quot; Ouch. Still, Steam user verdicts are markedly more enthusiastic, and what kind of jaded soul would turn his nose up at a Cluster Shot launcher with bouncing bullets? Bouncing bullets, Matt.

                              <span>A new month means a new RPS Game Club pick, and since a lot of us are still playing Bethesda&#x27;s epic space RPG, albeit to varying degrees of success, I thought I&#x27;d anoint Starfield as our selection for October. And yes, that will probably mean more creepy dad adventures are in the offing. Apologies in advance.

It garnered a lot of attention, especially from those Soulslike players who were patiently awaiting a team to create an underwater one where you play as a crab. Now, you can check out Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure for yourself with a new Steam demo that goes live tomorrow, October 3. 
The studio says this demo will feature two explorable areas: The Moon Caves, which is Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure&#x27;s tutorial area, and The Expired Grove. 
In our Steam Demo, you&#x27;ll explore TWO different areas:

To get some insight into how the game came together and learn about working with Shigeru Miyamoto, we spoke with chief and programming director Yuji Kando and planning director Yutaka Hiramuki over e-mail.
Game Informer: In 2015, Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview that Pikmin 4 development was “very close to completion.” Was that statement inaccurate at the time?
Kando: After the development for Pikmin 3 ended, we started development for Pikmin 4 as a small team.
As we made several attempts and tried out various things, there were moments when we could see the game take shape, but since we had to prioritize other projects, we weren&#x27;t able to create the deve…</span>

                              <span>Last week ended with a dire flood of layoffs in the games industry, including Sega, Ubisoft, Blizzard, and Epic games. Unfortunately, this week seems to be following the trend – Team17, developer of the Worms series, and publisher of games like Blasphemous, Dredge, and more, has announced layoffs as well, according to Eurogamer.
The job losses, which are due to a &quot;company restructure,&quot; will eliminate about 50 positions from the company, and the majority of those positions will be in the publisher&#x27;s QA department. Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.
In addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.
For more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.

                              <span>Bilkins&#x27; Folly is a throwback pirate adventure game that&#x27;s out today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s been on my radar since earlier this year: both because I love most anything related to pirates and because, well, Bilkins&#x27; Folly looks great. Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it&#x27;s finally out!
I spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins&#x27; Folly ahead of the game&#x27;s release over email. We discussed the game&#x27;s inspiration, the challenges of the adventure genre, the game&#x27;s gibberish language, how the idea of it came from a missing wedding ring, and much more.

                              <span>Payday 3 finally launched last month, more than six years after its initial reveal in 2017. We quite enjoyed it, and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Payday 3 review. Despite our enjoyment, many players encountered severe matchmaking issues that made it tough to play the game given its always-online nature. Now, just under two weeks after the game&#x27;s launch, developer Starbeeze Studios says the matchmaking issues are fixed. 
The team has also revealed the game&#x27;s first update will launch this month. Plus, Starbreeze says more than 3.1 million unique players played the game last month, with the peak concurrent player count hitting 124,254. Starbreeze &quot;will now intensify the commercial activities around Payday 3, after partially pausing these during the previous week,&quot; it says, with pla…</span>

                              <span>In April 2021, Jake Paul knocked out Ben Askren in less than two minutes. Shortly after on YouTube, the popular H3 Podcast declared the fight &quot;a disaster&quot; and showed a clip of the fight to back up their claims. After being sued by Triller for $50 million in copyright damages, H3 opted for a fair use defense. Now into its 124th week over a short clip of a fight that lasted 119 seconds, the lawsuit should be compulsory reading for YouTubers.

Though of course there&#x27;s something called Counter-Strike 2 happening at the moment. I dunno, doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s important to PC or anything.

In a fresh memorandum of understanding, signed by the Government&#x27;s Intellectual Property Office, Internet providers agree to voluntarily block sites that are deemed to be copyright infringing; no court order needed.

                              <span>&quot;Boomer shooter&quot; is a recent video game genre term used to describe contemporary games that exist as throwbacks to the Doom-inspired era of first-person shooters where speed and firepower are everything. Phantom Fury is not the first game to explore this playground, and it likely won&#x27;t be the last, but playing the demo left a good first impression. The visuals are cool, the shooting feels good, and protagonist Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison is not afraid to throw out a good one-liner when the mood strikes her.
Phantom Fury is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC sometime this year.

                              <span>With Mortal Kombat 1 on the horizon, we&#x27;re revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011&#x27;s Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game&#x27;s genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. 
After 2006&#x27;s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise&#x27;s main narrative, 2011&#x27;s entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9&#x27;s cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9&#x27;s story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

There have been some incredible Rogue-inspired games since, but nothing has quite stuck its disgusting, fly and poop-covered hooks in me like Edmund McMillen’s tale of a crying child fighting his murderous mother using the power of his tears. Yes, I’m in therapy, why do you ask?

                              <span>In another reality, 2003&#x27;s The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show&#x27;s 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can&#x27;t seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game&#x27;s lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit &amp; Run continues to be The Simpsons&#x27; most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.
Yet Hit &amp; Run&#x27;s sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there&#x27;s hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn&#x27;t just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.

It&#x27;s been a pleasure having him, even if but for a brief window of time, and I invite you all to come and bid him a fond farewell below.

                              <span>FSR 3, AMD’s framerate-roiding answer to DLSS 3 frame generation, is ready to roll in its first supporting games. Great! Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. 
Regardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the &#x27;real&#x27; frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.

While publisher Epic Games attributed the decision to economic factors - citing previous “pricing alignment” in countries including the UK over the summer - the move will follow hundreds of job losses at the company, partially as the result of lower than expected revenue for their immensely popular battle royale shooter.

                              <span>Dredge was one of this year’s more surprising gems, an unexpectedly winning combination of spooky Lovecraftian atmosphere, open-world exploration and compelling fishing sim that lay somewhere on the ocean-wide spectrum between the chill management of Stardew Valley and the existential dread of Sunless Sea.

                              <span>During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn&#x27;t Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn&#x27;t F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. 
I was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.

                              <span>It&#x27;s so stormy where I live that a house in the town next over lost its roof this morning, which must mean it&#x27;s the season for cosy life sim games. After having fun in Fae Farm recently, this week I&#x27;ve been taking Moonstone Island for a spin. The twist for this Stardewlike is that it has collided the farming and having a nice house business with Pokémon-style death battles involving whimsical Ghibli-esque Spirits. After a few scant hours I think I sort of... like it...? But I also have some problems with it.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time to discuss the focus of this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club, Hypnospace Outlaw! We&#x27;ve spent the last month writing a bunch of articles about Tendershoot&#x27;s weird and wonderful alternate-reality internet simulator, mourning a time when the internet used to be fun, reminiscing about virtual pets and even having a chat with the Hypnospace creator Jay Tholen about the game&#x27;s origins and legacy. But now it&#x27;s time to hear what you think about it. 
From 4pm BST today, we&#x27;ll be here to chat about the game together thanks to our fancy liveblogging technology. If you have some thoughts about Dylan Merchant, Coolpunk or Granny Cream&#x27;s Hot Butter Ice Cream, then make sure you pop in to let us know!

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077’s update 2.0 makes its RPG combat better than it’s ever been. The new perk system means that you can easily create a brutal killing machine, one capable of deflecting bullets with samurai swords and air-dashing like an anime hero to punch enemies apart.
Phantom Liberty, the expansion released right after update 2.0, makes its combat better in one extra way: by making most of it optional.

                              <span>Oh god, I&#x27;m so sorry. I&#x27;m so sorry. I&#x27;m trying to fix it. Oh, hello everybody! Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda&#x27;s so-big-it&#x27;s-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there&#x27;s one particular wandering geologist she&#x27;d like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate&#x27;s cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. 


I&#x27;ve spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren&#x27;t a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield&#x27;s in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game&#x27;s powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game&#x27;s weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It&#x27;s been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I&#x27;m not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: &quot;Totally Fucked&quot;.

The Elder Scrolls: Castles is a Tamriel-set spiritual sequel to Bethesda&#x27;s 2015-released touchscreen property sim Fallout Shelter, which swaps the latter&#x27;s underground Vaults for big gorgeous hunks of medieval masonry, yours to expand, decorate and lord over as you please.

                              <span>Beijing-based audio brand Edifier makes some of the best value speakers in the business, often offering significantly better performance, functionality and aesthetics than more well-known Western brands. I&#x27;ve reviewed a half-dozen of their speakers over the years, and each one has been impressive. 
I&#x27;m currently recommending Edifier&#x27;s R2000DB and S3000PRO speakers over at Eurogamer, but today an even more affordable model is on sale at Amazon US: the R1700BTs. These 2.0 bookshelf speakers normally go for $199, but today you can apply a $40 coupon on the product page to bring these speakers down to... $159, if my maths are correct. That&#x27;s a solid deal for speakers that come with a litany of positive critic and user reviews.

Except, of course, that the vast majority of those reviews are for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a game that is no longer playable. If you filter the reviews to just yesterday and today, you&#x27;ll find that there have been 3450 of them, just 59% of which are positive, which would give Counter-Strike 2 a rating of &quot;Mixed&quot;.

It&#x27;s a dripping, cheesily VO-d cinematic layer cake of gore and gristle that introduces you to the game&#x27;s god-blighted fantasy world and the many different ways you&#x27;ll expire within it - from having a boss inconsiderately drop a load of golden swords on you, to getting mobbed by underworld spooks according to an escalating &quot;dread&quot; level, which is sort of GTA&#x27;s old heat system but with more Grim Reapers.

                              <span>As friends, family and long-time RPS readers can probably attest, reverse Alleyway puzzler Holedown became a mild obsession of mine a few years back. Every spare idle moment I had, I&#x27;d be bouncing balls down its infinite planetary mining silos, mesmerised by the vacant stare of its iconic white Holedown worm (my record is still 1090m, in case you&#x27;re wondering). It&#x27;s a most joyous day, then (as much as it can be on a day like today), to hear that solo developer Grapefrukt will soon be back with another ball-bouncing beaut in the form of Subpar Pool, which is coming to PC (and phones) on October 12th.

                              <span>Cocoon is a puzzler where worlds are contained within orbs, and it&#x27;s your job to unpick puzzles with your ability to hop in and out of them, as well as carry them on your back. While it might sound complex, the worlds these orbs contain steer you carefully towards a clear goal every time: solve the problem, then grab your orb on the way out. Before you know it, you&#x27;re carrying orbs within orbs and you&#x27;re unravelling a cosmic mystery where the floor might be a biomechanical stingray or the path forward a spinal cord composed of ferns. I am convinced everyone should spring to action and hoist an orb on their shoulders. I couldn&#x27;t put mine down.

                              <span>As a child of the early internet, games like Hypnospace Outlaw can&#x27;t help but resonate quite deeply with me. This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace&#x27;s virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don&#x27;t pay enough attention to her.  
As with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.

Is always online good? Is it bad? Or, much like the radiator in your living room, is it basically invisible as long as nothing breaks? Plus we dive into the games we&#x27;ve been playing recently (Nate is still plugging away at Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3), recommend a bunch of unrelated short videos, and answer a question that has plagued humanity for years: would you punch a gorilla for a cheeseburger?

                              <span>Prime Day 2023 only came and went in July, but that hasn’t deterred Amazon – who presumably own a number of oversized clocks with the word &quot;DEALS&quot; replacing all twelve numbers – from announcing another, functionally identical sale. This time it’s Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, it’s happening this October, and god, I am so, so very tired of writing about these things.
Still, as much as Prime Big Deal Days is sillily named and oddly timed (is Black Friday not just a month later?), it may yet prove useful as a source of cheap PC gaming hardware. Amazon sales usually are, with SSDs, gaming mice, keyboards, and even graphics cards reliably among their discounted wares. Here’s everything we know so far, and some tips for the big day(s) on how to secure the best stuff and avoid shady rip-off tactics.

Valve’s new/revamped free-to-play FPS sports a range of exotic features and fixtures, from swirlier, reactive smoke to new server architecture, but it has launched without many of the modes, maps and functions Global Offensive diehards are accustomed to, after a decade of updates.

                              <span>There&#x27;s been a certain amount of confusion and alarm over the announcement of Nakwon: Last Paradise, a dingy third-person zombie survival adventure with a big emphasis on stealth, from the creators of Dave the Diver, a bright, breezy uramaki roll of a game that mixes restaurant management with side-on undersea exploration. Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket&#x27;s parents and ask for an intervention?


Thing is, if you take a step back from each game they&#x27;re actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver&#x27;s case, the water level, and in Nakwon&#x27;s case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake! Let&#x27;s have a look at the trailer.

In a statement posted by Epic president Tim Sweeney, he explains the layoffs as a cost-cutting measure that will include divesting Bandcamp, which it acquired last year, and spinning off advertising platform SuperAwesome into an independent company. Epic had acquired SuperAwesome in 2020. 250 people will be leaving Epic as a result of these divestitures. 
“For a while now, we&#x27;ve been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,” Sweeney writes in his statement. “I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retr…</span>

The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete wh…</span>

Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it&#x27;s expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that&#x27;s been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. …</span>

                              <span>Teardown is a voxel-based simulation game all about destruction, as its name implies. It launched in April of last year on PC and earlier this year, developer Tuxedo Labs announced the game was coming to consoles this year. Now, the studio has revealed Teardown hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on November 15. 
When it hits PS5 on November 15, it will also join the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium members. To coincide with today&#x27;s console launch news, Tuxedo Labs has also revealed a series of new missions, maps, vehicles, and more coming to Teardown over the next year as well as the game&#x27;s first-ever season pass.

                              <span>Developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interactive have delayed the console release of Cities: Skylines II. Originally set to release on October 24 alongside the PC version, the team has delayed the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game to spring of next year. The PC version will still launch next month. 
As for why, Colossal Order says in an update made on Twitter that the team needs more time to reach quality targets it has set for the console release. 
&quot;Mayors, we&#x27;re hard at work getting the game ready for release,&quot; the update reads. &quot;We&#x27;ve come to realize that we need more time to reach the quality targets set for console. We want to provide the best experience for our players, we&#x27;re updating the release window for Xbox &amp; PS5 to Spring 2024.&quot;

In a separate statement via email, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive say, &quot;The additional time allows us to focus on matching the quality and performance across all platforms.&quot; It also says it is updating the minimum and recommended PC specs as optimization work continues, and that it will share more updates on the console release window soon. 
Cities: Skylines II hits PC on October 24. The PS5 and Xbox Series X versions will be released sometime next spring.

It picks up right where the Through the Ashes DLC left off and launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in November. 
More specifically, Lord of Nothing hits consoles and PC on November 21. This DLC takes players to brand new locations, introduces new characters, and tasks players with taking down new foes. It continues the story of Sendri and Rekarth, and where we last saw them in the Through the Ashes DLC, too.

                              <span>Sega, the publisher behind next month&#x27;s Sonic Superstars, has canceled some unannounced titles in development and Creative Assembly&#x27;s first-person shooter, Hyenas. The company cites &quot;lower profitability of the European region.&quot; 
As a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. 


&quot;We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.,&quot; a Sega press release reads. &quot;We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.&quot; 
Sega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that &quot;there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.&quot; 
Sega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022. It has been playable in recent closed betas.</span>

                              <span>Announced earlier this year and releasing about four days shy of its promised Summer release window (the first day of Fall was September 23), Counter-Strike 2 is now suddenly available on Steam. You can check out the game&#x27;s launch trailer below.


The game has been playable in limited test form for some time, and rumors were swirling that the game would release soon, but it is still a surprise to see the game suddenly available on Steam. It has taken over Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&#x27;s spot on Steam and functions as an update to that game.
Below you will find some details from a press release for the game&#x27;s official release.
Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools.
In addition to the classic objective-focused gameplay that Counter-Strike pioneered in 1999, Counter-Strike 2 features:
All-new CS Ratings with the updated Premier mode
Global and Regional leaderboards
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Redesigned visual effects and audio
All items from CS:GO moving forward to CS2

                              <span>PlayStation head Jim Ryan is leaving the company, according to a press release from Sony Interactive Entertainment. Ryan has served as president and CEO since his appointment in 2018. Ryan’s tenure at Sony spans nearly 30 years, during which he’s held numerous leadership roles, including serving as the head of Sony Europe after former SIEE president Andrew House passed the torch in 2011.
Why Is Jim Ryan Leaving Sony?
&quot;I’ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America,&quot; Ryan said in the press release. &quot;I will leave having been privileged to work on products that have touched millions of lives across the world; PlayStation will always be part of my life, and I feel more optimistic than ever about the future of SIE. I want to thank Yoshida-san for placing so much trust in me and being an incredibly sensitive and supportive leader.&quot;
Ryan remains at the company until March 2024. Effective April 1, 2024, Sony Group Corporation President, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki will step in as SIE’s interim CEO, reporting to Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. Effective October 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment will appoint Totoki as chairman to aid PlayStation ahead of Ryan’s exit.</span>

Given how loudly people decry receiving waypoints, I&#x27;m a little surprised it was that close. And that&#x27;s how we know we&#x27;re doing science. This week, I ask you to choose between mastery of place and mastery of time. What&#x27;s better: improvised environmental weapons, or skipping across a timeline flowchart?

We don&#x27;t normally cover Mac gaming here, but I thought you might want to know that the latest M2 Mac Mini is down to $499 at B&amp;H Photo in the US, a $100 reduction on the base-spec unit that makes it quite a powerful computer for the money.

                              <span>One of the lantern fish lures dangled in the face of anybody losing momentum in Starfield is &quot;mate, you would not believe the weird stuff that happens in New Game Plus&quot;. I won&#x27;t say too much - not in this opening paragraph, anyway - but there&#x27;s a playfulness to the post-completion options that you don&#x27;t really find in the rest of Bethesda&#x27;s much-ballyhooed RPG. It&#x27;s the kind of thing you expect from modders, not the developers themselves.

                              <span>I like small things - models, and what not - but I&#x27;m not patient enough to build them from scratch myself. Lego sets represent an ideal, if monstrously expensive, solution. I can build the thing without having to make all the constituent parts of it. I&#x27;ve recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don&#x27;t actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall. But better.

                              <span>EA is moving away from its decades-long FIFA series with the release of EA Sports FC later this week. It seems that the publisher is taking the idea of replacing FIFA quite literally, too, as it has pulled every previous FIFA game from sale on PC storefronts Steam and Epic.

                              <span>A friend recently found her old floppy disks from the 1997, uncovering a treasure trove of poetry, MS Paint art, homework, screensavers, and fanfic. Delightful finds which I feel privileged to have seen. I very much do not have my old floppies. They&#x27;re all long-gone, chucked along with all my old websites and blogs and CDs and everythings in strict sentimentality purges. I don&#x27;t know if I now regret that. So with vintage Internet simulator Hypnospace Outlaw being our game of the month in the RPS Game Club, I&#x27;m wondering: do you have your old sites and stuff? Dare you share it with us?

This week the Vietnamese government reported progress; 1,000 pirate sites blocked in the last 12 months. Most offered live football streams, so not exactly great news for Hollywood, but factors other than copyright may have played a role.

Capcom released Resident Evil 4 remake earlier this year, and despite missing some of the original’s most memorable moments, it was a deserved critical hit. It’s a fantastic, updated reimaging of Leon’s original horrific adventure through an approximation of rural Spain. Separate Ways is represents a different remake, putting players in control of Ada Wong and reexamining the expansion initially added to the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4 in 2005. The DLC lets players see the story from a new perspective, fill in some narrative gaps, learn m…</span>

                              <span>Netflix announced in 2021 that it was developing an animated Tomb Raider series starring Lara Croft. Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year&#x27;s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. 
There&#x27;s no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it&#x27;s coming to the subscription streaming service soon. 
Check out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018&#x27;s Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell&#x27;s role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it&#x27;s hard to say whether or not that&#x27;s the case. But it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. 
In the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix&#x27;s Devil May Cry anime series released today as well. In terms of new Tomb Raider games, the first three PlayStation 1 titles are getting remastered next year.

                              <span>After failing to take action following complaints from a new manga platform established in Russia by South Korea, manga piracy site ReManga will reportedly face legal action. With around 18 million visits each month, ReManga is certainly popular, but copyright lawsuits aren&#x27;t the only threat. Rising state censorship means that illegal and legal platforms alike face potential ISP blocking.

While several news outlets are in on the joke, prospective pirates will be disappointed. The two-and-a-half hour release turns out to be an anti-piracy campaign, complemented with movie trailers.

                              <span>Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

                              <span>The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.
