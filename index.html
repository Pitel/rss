                              <span>Having a (relatively) small device that can play basically any big game on it is a cool idea, and that’s what I love about Valve’s Steam Deck. But the Deck can be a bit bulky, and its battery just doesn’t last sometimes. Plus it doesn’t work easily with Xbox Game Pass. So the idea of a new, smaller handheld dedicated…

The Dark Souls III PC servers were back up, and now it seems they&#x27;re back down again. Players are reporting in, unable to access the game, and the social account has acknowledged a confirmed issue.
As noted by PC Gamer, speculation had started picking up yesterday on the Steam forums, where users were starting to have issues with the servers.
A new tweet from the Dark Souls brand account on Twitter notes that there is a confirmed issue with Dark Souls III online play, via the Steam platform.
&quot;We are investigating the source of the problem and will inform you as soon as more details become available,&quot; the update says. &quot;Thank you for your patience.&quot;

Rise again, Ashen One
The PC servers for Dark Souls III were off for quite a while. Users discovered an exploit in the Souls series that has kept its PC versions offline for most of the year. Online PC services only just recently came back online for Dark Souls III. The team behind the updates had previously said they were working on bringing services back for the other back-entries in the Souls series, but now it looks like Dark Souls III may need more attention.
Meanwhile, Elden Ring had the specific vulnerability addressed pre-launch and has been cooking along just fine. So for PC players, the only FromSoft multiplayer game in town is Elden Ring once again.
It&#x27;s a bummer, as each game has had its own meta-game and PvP communities. Numbers even seemed to jump up a bit for Dark Souls III after the fix was implemented.
Though no specifics have been given, hopefully this fix doesn&#x27;t take months like the others have. We&#x27;ll learn more as the Souls team works on getting the Dark Souls III PC servers back up.

                              <span>Star Citizen passes yet another impressive milestone
It&#x27;s a known fact that it takes a long, long time to make games, but Cloud Imperium Games is testing gamers&#x27; patience with their in-development title Star Citizen, which began pre-production all the way back in 2010. The game was officially announced in 2012 with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for development, and while it was anticipated to release in 2014, the game was delayed multiple times... and still is yet to receive any sort of official release window.
Ten years after the launch of the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign, the game has reached an incredible milestone by raising over $500 million — the official count as of today is $500,075,150 from 4,096,384 backers. (Thanks, Eurogamer.) I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m mor…</span>

You&#x27;ve probably noticed Trombone Champ popping up all over your social media feeds over the last couple days or so. It is instantly recognizable as exactly what it is: a rhythm game about playing the trombone. The simplicity belies the point, though. Trombone Champ is a trombone rhythm game, and an exceedingly good one too.
At this point, I&#x27;d go into some sort of recitation of how Trombone Champ sets this all up. Maybe how it handles, or what buttons it uses to do the things it does. The mouse moves a cursor up and down in inverted fashion, and your mouse click or any keyboard button is held to play notes.
Yet much like Untitled Goose Game or Snipperclips, this is the sort of experience you can just &quot;get&quot; by looking at it. It&#x27;s probably why the ga…</span>

After much speculation and some leaks, Logitech has lifted the lid on its new built-for-cloud-gaming handheld system, the Logitech G Cloud, ahead of its October 17 launch. It&#x27;s a device for players who actively use services like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now (or even Steam Link), but plenty of us are still only dabbling in this stuff at best.
The handheld Android device has a 7-inch 1080p touchscreen, a supposed 12-hour battery life, and &quot;haptics, gyroscope, and remappable control,&quot; according to Logitech. I will say, it&#x27;s a sleek design. The Logitech G Cloud is 10.11 inches by 4.61 inches, and weighs 463 grams, which would sandwich it between the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.

                              <span>Nintendo confirms what most assumed
How is Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom pronounced? Well that&#x27;s easy, because we have an official answer from Nintendo! As reported by Eurogamer, Nintendo has clarified that it&#x27;s &quot;tears,&quot; as in the &quot;crying&quot; variety, not tears, like tearing a piece of paper. I can see the eyerolling now, but this was debated by some for a hot minute!
Given the dark tone and how things seem to be in disarray in this new entry, &quot;tears&quot; (again, crying) of sorrow is what immediately went to my head. However, as many have pointed out, much of the kingdom seems to be literally torn apart in the game&#x27;s various trailers, with plenty of floating structures that would feel right at home in a Miyazaki movie. It&#x27;s entirely possible that &quot;tears&quot; (crying) could be literal items that you pick up in the game, or directly incorporated into the story in some way. Nintendo has plenty of time to showcase story details in various streams and reveals.
Here&#x27;s all we have to go off of for now: &quot;In addition to the vast lands of Hyrule, the latest entry in the storied Legend of Zelda series will take you up into the skies!&quot;
In any case, it&#x27;s going to take me ages to not refer to this as Zelda: Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom. I mean I almost typed that out multiple times when talking about the game, even in this very article! Despite being billed as a full sequel to Breath of the Wild, there&#x27;s no &quot;2&quot; in the moniker, and it&#x27;s going its own way. It makes perfect sense, as word will travel that it&#x27;s a direct follow-up anyway.
We&#x27;ll see how much Breath of the Wild DNA is truly baked in when it arrives on May 12, 2023.

                              <span>&#x27;Tis the season for more Picross
Jupiter is back to bring some more Picross action to the Switch. Picross S8 has been announced for the Nintendo Switch, arriving on September 29 with a cool feature: four-player co-op.
In Picross S8, up to four players will be able to co-op solve Picross puzzles on a single Switch. Each player will need their own controller, but you can use single Joy-Cons for each person if you&#x27;d like.
Seeing it in action can feel almost bizarre. Different colored bars and crosshairs jaunt around the board, and it looks like players rack up points for their correct guesses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YIBaaQajwyI
For me, Picross is often a solo exercise of light brain puzzling and the good feeling of getting a guess right. It fills the same space as logic puzzles or sudoku. But I can see how, especially with the big boards, it would be fun to get a bunch of people in. Plus, it would probably make teaching a family member or loved one how to play Picross pretty easy.
Even more puzzling
Of course, on top of the new feature in co-op, there is plenty of Picross to tackle. 300 Picross and Mega Picross puzzles are included in Picross S8. There are also 150 Clip Picross puzzles, 30 Color puzzles, and five extra puzzles. That total count is 485 puzzles, if you lost track.
Linking play data from Picross S4, S5, and S6 also unlocks three Extra puzzles. It is a chance for even more Picross to uncover, either with friends or all by yourself.
This marks the eighth Picross S entry on the Switch for Jupiter, and the studio has become pretty good at rolling these out at a regular pace. Just like the seasons change and leaves fall, a new Picross is probably around the corner. I&#x27;m still waiting for the day we get another Picross 3D, but I&#x27;m always happy to have some new puzzles on my Switch for my next long stretch of travel.

                              <span>2B getting a lil&#x27; foxy
We are just a few weeks out from the Nintendo Switch port of the exciting and highly melodramatic NieR: Automata. Publisher Square Enix has released a new trailer showing off the PlatinumGames-produced action-adventure, also taking the time to spotlight some exclusive new DLC content.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hiWGORJRNr0&amp;t
The Switch port, titled NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition, will already feature all of the post-release skins, gear, and other additional items featured in its PlayStation, PC, and Xbox brethren, but will also include the all-new &quot;6C2P4A118680823&quot; DLC pack, which will include new character costumes for protagonists 2B, 9S, and A2, as well as new looks for their respective pods. The DLC includes outfits based on the recent remake NieR: Replicant, as well as some traditional Japanese garb, including samurai and kunoichi gear, complete with fox masks.
NieR: Automata first launched on PS4 back in 2017 and has slowly gathered a larger and larger audience in the ensuing years. The dizzying hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash title tells the story of a war between mankind and the machines, and the fates of the sentient androids that are placed right in the center of the interplanetary conflict. NieR: Automata has won praise for its bleak, dystopian world, dramatic storytelling, smart enemy design, and its unforgettable protagonist, 2B, who has fast become a gaming icon. And with the release The End of YORHA Edition no doubt bring further acolytes are to be brought into the fold.
NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>&quot;It will no longer be possible to sign in to a Nintendo Account using Facebook or Twitter&quot;
As far as Nintendo Accounts are concerned, the Nintendo Facebook and Twitter linking feature is ending very soon — next month, in fact.
The company has provided an October 25, 2022 end date, at which point everyone who uses those two options will need to sign in using their Nintendo Account email address/ID, or a Google/Apple account. This applies across the board to all Nintendo Accounts, even on Nintendo Switch, so it&#x27;s not a legacy/Wii U/3DS thing.
What does this even mean, exactly?

Note that a lot of folks can safely ignore this option, though some of you might be impacted. As you can see in the example sign-in screen above, there&#x27;s an option to use Facebook or Twitter directly, in addition to Google, Apple, and a direct Nintendo Account login.
So roughly seven years ago, Nintendo touted the ability to sign into a Nintendo Network account with Facebook and Twitter as a way to acquire customers more easily. But a lot has changed since then, particularly when it comes to information security. While Nintendo hasn&#x27;t given a concrete reason for why they&#x27;re making this change, it&#x27;s coming regardless, so you might need to prepare yourself for the October 25 end date. For the time being, it has been clarified that Google/Apple sign-ins will stay.
To be extra clear, the ability to share screens and the like on Twitter and Facebook will remain, this change is solely for Nintendo Account sign-ins.

                              <span>Backwards Compatibility now an offline affair
Microsoft has quietly tweaked the infrastructure of its shiny Xbox Series X hardware to now allow the playing of Xbox One games without the need for an online DRM check.
The new &quot;feature,&quot; which is included in the console&#x27;s 2206 Update, will allow Xbox Series users to play their Xbox One games in an offline capacity. Previously, the console would always do a brief online handshake to ensure that the Xbox One game in question was an authentic, licensed title and not a copied disc — The Xbox Series S, being discless, obviously had no need to perform this additional step.
Speaking on Twitter, Xbox engineer and great-named person Eden Marie confirmed the update.
&quot;Yes, this is true since the 2206 update,&quot; wrote Marie. &quot;We examined data since Series X/S launch &amp; determined the online compatibility check isn&#x27;t needed in the vast majority of cases for Xbox One discs. Some games may still need to be updated online after install to ensure the best experience.&quot;
While this is a different situation entirely, one cannot help but recall the PR disaster that occurred prior to the Xbox One console&#x27;s release, where Microsoft stated that an online connection was a mandatory demand for the playing of Xbox One games, to ensure that the player had indeed purchased a license for each and every title. While this would eventually prove not to be the case, there&#x27;s no denying whatsoever that the initial statement was a Sword of Damocles over the brand, and certainly contributed to sales of Xbox hardware declining at the start of the eighth generation.
The 2206 Update is now live on Xbox Series X/S platforms.

                              <span>Tribute Games is celebrating the game&#x27;s 10th anniversary with a Switch port on Oct. 6
It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve thought about Wizorb — long enough that reading my decade-old review almost feels like peering into a past life. But every memory I&#x27;m pulling up is a good one, and I&#x27;m stoked to see this Arkanoid-style brick-breaking game resurface. For its 10th anniversary, Wizorb is coming to Nintendo Switch on October 6, 2022.
If you were big into Xbox 360 during the Xbox Live Indie Games heyday, you might be pumped too. But if you&#x27;ve never heard of Wizorb before (despite its later ports, including Steam), then you should check it out. It&#x27;s classic arcade gameplay with light RPG touches.

                              <span>Thank you for the music
Next month, the legendary Persona franchise will take to the stage once again, as the returning Persona Super Live P-Sound 2022 concert will regale a packed auditorium with a playlist of memorable and distinctive tunes pulled from the iconic JRPG series. However, anyone expecting any sort of reveal may want to keep their expectations in check...
According to a statement by publisher Atlus, the concert will not be used as an opportunity to reveal any new games set within the reality-bending universe. Fans can expect some awesome music, live vocals, bafflingly written lyrics, and appearances from the series&#x27; voice cast — but if you go in expecting a Persona 6 announcement, then you might come away a little disappointed. With ringing ears, tapping toes, and having had a great night, mind, but disappointed.
It&#x27;s understandable that some fans might be getting a tad antsy, given that the smash-seller Persona 5 debuted way back in 2016, following a development cycle that lasted practically an entire generation. Since then, Atlus has released several new spin-offs, including musou-like Persona 5 Strikers, two new Persona Dancing titles, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth for Nintendo 3DS. But if you&#x27;re holding out for Persona 6 announcement, keep holding, friend. After all, even when we get the inevitable reveal, how long is that dev cycle going to be?
Persona Super Live P-Sound 2022 takes place October 8-9 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan

                              <span>Also, Slime Rancher 2
The Xbox Game Pass list for September has been published by Microsoft, and there&#x27;s a few really great additions this month.
Deathloop is the clear-cut big one here, given that it was previously a PlayStation exclusive, and a punt for a lot of folks. The premise isn&#x27;t for everyone, and even after a fairly positive critical reception, I don&#x27;t blame anyone for wanting to wait on the fence for it. A Game Pass release ending an exclusivity period is the perfect combo.
The rest of the list isn&#x27;t slouching either. Hardspace: Shipbreaker adds some variety to the mix, as does Slime Rancher 2. Another big round comes in late September, with Grounded (a major Obsidian/Microsoft release) hitting the service on September 27, followed by a Valheim game preview. Again, a lot of Game Pass offerings are nailing it in terms of adding a good chunk of &quot;wait and see&quot; projects. For many, since it launched in early access in early 2021, Valheim is one of the biggest examples of that. It&#x27;s still slated for a 2023 full release, by the way.

A new Sonic Team animated logo just dropped, and the team seems pretty excited about it, as they enter a new era of the franchise.
As we&#x27;ve established, Sega believes this is going to be a huge year for Sonic, with Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Prime (the Netflix show) launching in a few months, on top of the arrival of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie, and Sonic Origins earlier this year. Here&#x27;s the full statement from Sonic Creative Director Kazuyuki Hoshino:
&quot;Hey Sonic Fans! The Sonic IP is working on becoming bigger than ever. This year with &quot;Project Sonic &#x27;22&quot; we are developing more than just Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Origins. We are also working on getting Sonic out on more mediums such as merch, social media, collaborations with artis…</span>

                              <span>Manage the comedy series&#x27; team your way
This is a bit different from the usual news of a club signing on for FIFA. Electronic Arts confirms that Ted Lasso, of the series Ted Lasso, and the AFC Richmond squad are joining the roster of FIFA 23.
Jason Sudeikis&#x27; portrayal of lovable coach Ted Lasso will appear in-game, as well as a host of others from the AFC Richmond crew. Coach Beard, Jamie Tartt, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, Roy Kent, and Isaac McAdoo are all lined up. Their home field of Nelson Road is also being integrated into FIFA 23.
And honestly, they all look solid in motion. Check it out in the trailer below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;TUamiLX6gp4
According to the EA blog about the news, Ted will be selectable as a playable manager in Career Mode. You can also opt to manage AFC Richmond, swapping them into the Premier League or other playable Career Mode leagues.
AFC Richmond will also be playable in other modes, like Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons, with the Nelson Road stadium available.
Kits and TIFOs for AFC Richmond are also being incorporated into Ultimate Team, as well as the option to have Ted or Coach Beard as your club manager. All AFC Richmond content in the FUT mode will be available through objectives and challenges.
Barbeque sauce
If you&#x27;re not familiar, Ted Lasso is a series on Apple+ based on an NBC shorts series. Ted is an American football coach who moves to England to take up the head coaching job for a Premier League team, and while it&#x27;s definitely a comedy, it&#x27;s also pretty heartfelt and enjoyable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3u7EIiohs6U
So it&#x27;s definitely rad to see the whole AFC crew in here, and yeah, I&#x27;m actually kind of into the idea of playing a season as Ted and AFC. That chance isn&#x27;t far off either. FIFA 23 goes live on September 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Stadia.

                              <span>From September 18 to October 1, 2022
If you want to get in on a shiny Eternatus Pokemon Sword and Shield event, you&#x27;ll have to go to an actual store in the near future.
Following a tease that it would be happening in some regions, information on the distribution event is fully live now on the official Pokemon site.
All the details on the Pokemon shiny Eternatus distribution:
It&#x27;s located at GameStop (in the US and Canada) or EB Games (in Australia and New Zealand)
As per usual you don&#x27;t need to buy anything, and the code will be distributed by way of a card
The event runs from September 18 through October 1
The Eternatus you&#x27;ll get from the event is level 100, with timid nature and the pressure ability (move-wise it sports dynamax cannon, eternabeam, sludge bomb, and flamethrower)
Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:
Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.
Overall it&#x27;s a pretty simple process: other than going to the store! At least this event is for a shiny legendary, and not a quirky character from the anime.
[Update: EB Games Australia has clarified that the offer will be available in the region, albeit in &quot;early October.&quot;]

Infinity Ward has addressed complaints from the Call of Duty player community about its Modern Warfare 2 closed beta, which took place over the past weekend. Many veteran players were frustrated by an — understandably odd — new tweak that has been made to the in-game mini-map.
It&#x27;s all a question of noise location. In Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, the sound of players firing their weapons does not register as a red dot on the mini-map, giving away their position. This baffling choice has been implemented in order to force players to source out enemy positions via sound only. Unfortunately, it has had a very negative response from the playerbase, who find the change not only unnecessary but even problematic.
&quot;The design reason for this is that we do not want to punish player…</span>

                              <span>Gear, Grub, or Fun
Over on the game&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account, Nintendo has provided official art commemorating the first post-launch Splatoon 3 Splatfest. While rock/paper/scissors was technically the first pre-launch Splatfest, the upcoming event this weekend will serve as the first major event for the game, coinciding with the recent patch that addresses some pre-launch concerns.
As you can see in the art, Shiver has definitely landed on team gear, posing with the shovel and the lantern in the marquee image for the Splatfest. Frye is on team grub, with a host of sweets and a piece of pizza on hand. Big Man is rocking the Nintendo Switch, clearly signifying fun in a clever synergistic marketing kind of way.
When does the gear, grub, and fun Splatoon 3 Splatfest start?
So the exact start…</span>

Sony Interactive Entertainment has updated its PlayStation Plus catalog, bringing a new selection of titles to Extra and Premium tier members of the paid subscription service. What&#x27;s up for grabs in September 2022? Read on, dear viewer, and I&#x27;ll regale you with the goodness.
All PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium users can check out a pretty durn violent catalog of modern classics, including Arkane Studio&#x27;s chrono-killer Deathloop, the urban jungle of Ubisoft&#x27;s Watch Dogs 2, and Egyptian adventure Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins — also from Ubisoft. Slightly less murder-oriented are the wholesome indie releases Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and sea-faring adventure Spiritfarer: Farewell Edition. Check out the full list below.

Whenever someone goes back to refresh the visuals of an iconic video game with a very established and well-remembered look, things can get a bit funky. So while I understand the appeal of something like Portal with RTX, a &quot;reimagined&quot; Portal kitted out with ray tracing, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s strictly better. It&#x27;s different! And you may or may not dig it.
Alongside (pricey!) GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs, Nvidia announced Portal with RTX as free DLC coming to Steam in November for Portal owners. 15 years later, if you can believe it.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight, we’re treading in &quot;Nontendo&quot; waters discussing the Grand Theft Auto VI leak and how leaks generally affect games and marketing. An undercooked early look at a megapopular IP is extremely rare, so there&#x27;s much to discuss!

GTA VI pre-alpha footage leaked early which has made it more obvious than ever that most gamers don&#x27;t have a base understanding of how games are made. In the leaked footage GTA VI is buggy, runs poorly, and lacks finished models — understandably! The footage was stolen and showcased in the…</span>

                              <span>The PC port seems to have done the trick
This August saw a familiar face web-zip his way up the NPD rankings. Following a PC port of Insomniac&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, the game shot up to third in the month&#x27;s best-selling titles.
As NPD&#x27;s Mat Piscatella notes, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man made the leap from 84th in July to 3rd in August. Concurrently, Spider-Man was the best seller of the month across all tracked Steam titles.

Insomniac&#x27;s web-crawler hit the PlayStation in 2018, but the remastered version made the jump to PC on August 12. And it seems like that jump was very successful, both critically and in sales.
While it doesn&#x27;t have the Miles Morales content yet, the combination of high-end PC features and the potential portability (it…</span>

The developer&#x27;s claims include copyright infringement, but nothing in its complaint is going unchallenged. It transpires that Bungie&#x27;s target is a teenager, one that in typical fashion has an answer for everything, with help from his lawyer, of course.

The rightsholders accused the company of turning a blind eye to piracy and demanded far-reaching measures, which included handing over the identities of alleged pirates. The terms of the settlement remain private but may include a damages component.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve only got OneShot.
A cat-like child named Niko wakes up in a decrepit house, locked in a room with a bookshelf, a password-locked computer, and a TV remote control on the floor. It’s too dark to read the books and there’s no sign of a password anywhere – it&#x27;s up to you to find a way out. Not long after, Niko stumbles upon a massive lightbulb in the basement. Carrying this prize into the lightless wastes, a prophetic robot claims Niko is the saviour – a messiah meant to carry the sun to the tower at the centre of the world to restore daylight. This is the set-up of OneShot: World Machine Edition, a short point-and-click adventure game originally developed in 2014 with an endearing, sombre story.
Games like OneShot are difficult to review because to delve too deeply into the narrative would ruin the experience. Just know this: developer Future Cat makes you – the player – a character in the story. Niko’s quest is framed as a game installed on a PC that functions as both a menu and narrative device. Options to choose wallpapers, change the colour scheme, view achievements, and the like take the form of desktop icons. Niko will frequently break the fourth wall to address you by your Nintendo Switch profile name as you guide her through a dying world. Future Cat makes clever use of this dichotomy between the desktop PC and the game within to add creative layers to an already compelling adventure.

Nintendo has reported that a bug has been found in Splatoon 3, and it might cause votes to not count towards this weekend&#x27;s Splatfest results.
Sharing the details on Twitter, the Big N says that some players have found that conch shell&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve picked up before voting for their Splatfest team — which is either Gear, Grub, or Fun — might disappear. If they do, this means the player&#x27;s vote may not count.

Shigeru Miyamoto is probably the most recognisable name in the game industry today. He&#x27;s essentially the &quot;father&quot; of Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, and Pikmin — the latter of which he thoroughly enjoyed representing in last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. But even back in the NES days, Miyamoto was full of sage advice, as revealed in a 1989 BEEP magazine interview translated by Shmuplations and shared by Dave Rupert.
1989 is the year that Super Mario Land, DuckTales, the original Mother, and Castlevania III: Dracula&#x27;s Curse were first released (among many other things!), so it was a pretty strong year for Nintendo. And, reflecting on his own success back then, Miyamoto had a simple answer to BEEP&#x27;s question “What’s the secret to success in the game industry?”:

There was a point a year or so back when it seemed every day brought with it a new &#x27;Switch Pro&#x27; rumour, although things have recently been quieter on that front. However, an Nvidia employee has confirmed — apparently accidentally — the existence of a chip, the Tegra239, rumoured to have existed since 2021 and supposedly meant to be powering that mystical new Nintendo hardware that we&#x27;re all waiting for.
This information was shared on Twitter by @CentroLeaks after being picked up on the GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit and shared by u/followmeinblue. Nvidia is currently holding a three-day event to promote many of its new products, including its next generation of graphics cards — of which many of the details were leaked back in March this year.

                              <span>Is it a JRPG with farming, or a farm sim with JRPG elements?
Ahead of its November 4th release date, Square Enix&#x27;s take on the farming game genre, Harvestella, recently received a demo on Switch, so you can try before you buy. The save will transfer over to the full game, if you decide it&#x27;s worth the £50 / $60.
As part of a farm sim-filled Nintendo Direct, we were keen to investigate this one in particular. For those who&#x27;ve played it — what do you think of the farming-JRPG hybrid? We&#x27;ve spent some time with it, and have some thoughts...

Picross S8 is coming to the Switch on September 29th, but in a move that might shock followers of this addictive puzzler series, it will bring along with it an update to all of developer Jupiter&#x27;s other Picross games, bringing both &#x27;touch panel operation&#x27; and &#x27;4-player simultaneous play&#x27; to the series.
From what we understand, this update will become active alongside the release of S8, so be ready to download an update for all previous games later this month.

The monthly NPD sales figures have been released for August, and it shows that last month was a pretty quiet one for Nintendo. Mat Piscatella of the NPD Group shared the results on Twitter, and in August, the PS5 outsold the Switch in both dollar sales and unit sales.
The Switch is still, overall, the best-selling console of the year in North American markets in terms of units sold. Across the pond here in the UK, the PS5 is actually the best-selling console of 2022 so far (up to August of this year).

Data on Europe&#x27;s best selling games during the month of August is now available courtesy of GameIndustry.biz, showcasing a strong presence from Nintendo with Nintendo Switch Sports being the best selling physical game.
Coming in at number seven in the charts (keep in mind that Nintendo doesn&#x27;t provide data on its digital sales), Nintendo Switch Sports lands just ahead of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Leading the pack at number one is Grand Theft Auto 5 which, coincidentally, also topped the charts during August of 2021. On the other end of the scale, Mario Strikers: Battle League comes in at number twenty, while Xenoblade Chronicles 3 enters at number nineteen.

Shmuplations has translated two interviews from 2002 on the development of the then-upcoming Super Mario Sunshine, and both reveal some rather interesting details about how the game&#x27;s FLUDD mechanic, and Mario&#x27;s short-sleeved look, came to be (thanks, Time Extension!).
The first of these interviews appeared in Nintendo Dream and is between Mario creator and producer Shigeru Miyamoto, Sunshine&#x27;s producer Takashi Tezuka, and the game&#x27;s director Yoshiaki Koizumi. The trio discusses the trials and tribulations of getting a unique Mario game onto the GameCube, a system that was still relatively new at the time of the game&#x27;s development.

                              <span>It was I, DioField!
Published by Square Enix and developed with assistance from Lancarse, The DioField Chronicle looks and feels like most tactical RPGs out on the Switch in many ways, but with everything just slightly tweaked. The characters are all undeniably stylised, but never quite as much as Fire Emblem: Three Houses. The politics are front and centre throughout the game’s story, but don’t feel as overt as classics like Final Fantasy Tactics. The game’s take on war feels more reminiscent of Valkyria Chronicles than anything else. The DioField Chronicle borrows liberally from other gems of the genre without feeling like a carbon copy.
The game follows the story of a rising empire in the east that threatens to overtake the rest of the continent. As a response, the remaining nations banded together, creating a conflict between the Empire and the Alliance that provides the backdrop to everything else that unfolds in the story. Most of the story takes place in the nation of Alletain on the island of DioField, which is rich in the mineral that powers magic in this setting and therefore is a prize both sides of the conflict covet. Most of this backstory is delivered in a shotgun blast of information that hits the player in an opening crawl. As we mentioned above, the setup feels very similar to 2008’s Valkyria Chronicles, though with a focus on magic rather than technology. It isn’t complicated, but it doesn’t need to be to get the point across.

                              <span>But wait, there&#x27;s more!
Always ready to unpack a little more of Nintendo&#x27;s history, a collaboration between preservation site Forest of Illusion, @Render_Archive and @Nintoid has amounted in the upload of a long sought-after Nintendo Company Report from 1996. The edition includes a wealth of nostalgic gaming material from sales reports to upcoming hardware features, and it also gives a look at some exclusive early promo renders. And the best part? It&#x27;s free to read online!
The company report, which you can download and read over on Forest of Illusion&#x27;s blog, has all of the things that we would expect to find in Nintendo&#x27;s yearly round-up accompanied by images of all its figureheads (we refer, of course, to Mario, Kirby and Link). But perhaps the most interesting nugget of rare retro goodness comes from a screenshot reel of the 1995 Nintendo 64 B-Roll, which shows a small section of Super Mario 64 in a stage that many die-hard fans of the game may not recognise.

2K has taken to Twitter via its @2KSupport account to warn players of a phishing scam. The scam comes as a result of a security breach from an &quot;unauthorised third party&quot; that accessed customer information through one of its help desk platform vendors.
According to the statement, illegal access was gained to certain customers&#x27; email and a &quot;malicious link&quot; was sent to certain players.

                              <span>Or, what Pokémon would look like if Ditto copied it.
Ever wondered how a Pokémon game might turn out if it were created using a neural network? No, we can&#x27;t say we have, either. But, we kind of have answer thanks to Ollin Boer Bohan, a Deep Learning Scientist at NVIDIA, who has created a playable Pokémon overworld using a neural network. Spoilers: it&#x27;s wild; like jumping into a Pokémon-themed fever dream with no escape. Give it a go!
As reported by Automaton, Bohan utilised a computing system that is modeled on the human brain and nervous system, training it to effectively mimick what a true Pokémon game would look like (hello, Ditto!). As you&#x27;d probably expect, there are no actual gameplay elements at work here; you can use your computer keyboard to move the character around, but what you&#x27;re seeing on screen is purely a visual representation of a Pokémon game.

Update : In a statement mimicking its response to Joe Merrick, The Pokémon Company has doubled down on its stance regarding Nuzlocke runs, stating to Eurogamer that &quot;The Pokémon Company International does not have any issues with fans or creators playing the video games with Nuzlocke rules&quot;.
As mentioned in the original article, The Pokémon Company&#x27;s statement perhaps indicates that it had more of an issue promoting the Nuzlocke Challenge in an official capacity, rather than taking umbrage with the Nuzlocke Challenge as a concept.

Announced during the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is the new detective action title from the minds behind the Danganronpa series.
Due for launch in Spring 2023 (the pre-order pages currently display a launch date of June 30th, 2023, but this is likely a placeholder), pre-orders for the game have now gone live and you can even splash out on a newly announced &#x27;Mysteriful Limited Edition&#x27; for a cool $109.99. This will include a steelbook, an artbook, a 6.5&quot; Shinigami plush, and an official soundtrack on CD. Pre-order links can be found at the bottom of the page.

Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team&#x27;s biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors&#x27; likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t indicated if we&#x27;ll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent&#x27;s signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent&#x27;s chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond&#x27;s home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club&#x27;s manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.</span>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

As someone definitely not attempting to rig the vote, I respect people on both sides yet am pleased by this outcome. This week, ah sure, why not have another crack at pitting two similar-ish things against each other. It feels against the spirit of the competition but I&#x27;m curious. Let&#x27;s try two sounds.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover &#x27;charms&#x27;. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it&#x27;s something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

Think of the Machinist as the Aldi equivalent to Marvel’s Tony Stark, Iron Man. He’s still packed to the circuit boards with machine guns, lasers and drones, even if he is an own-brand alternative to the Armoured Avenger.

                              <span>The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon&#x27;s Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon&#x27;s trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here&#x27;s the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That&#x27;s how it feels to play, too.

                              <span>Of all the games I sampled at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, Scorn surprised me the most. For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.
Nope - the game wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

This is not the case. Developers know that, so some have shared early footage of well-known games that you and I have most likely played in a very different form.

                              <span>Blender 3.0 přestal podporovat běh na GPU za pomoci obecného rozhraní OpenCL. AMD pracovala na implementaci vlastního systému HIP, který od Blenderu 3.2 funguje i na Linuxu. S nedávným vydáním Blenderu 3.3 přibyla podpora běhu rendereru Cycles na AMD GPU rodiny Vega. Přespříští verze 3.5 by pak mohla přinést i podporu raytracingu na AMD GPU, stihne-li se vše včas.</span>

                              <span>Evropská unie dala 8,5 milionu eur na tříletý projekt OpenWebSearch.EU. Z představení projektu: &quot;Projekt má svůj původ v obavách z nerovnováhy na trhu vyhledávačů. Tato nerovnováha ohrožuje demokracii a omezuje inovační potenciál evropského výzkumného prostředí a ekonomiky. Během tří let výzkumníci vyvinou jádro evropského otevřeného webového indexu (European Open Web Index (OWI)), které bude základem pro nové internetové vyhledávání v Evropě. Projekt navíc položí základy pro otevřenou a rozšířitelnou evropskou otevřenou infrastrukturu pro vyhledávání a analýzu webu (European Open Web Search and Analysis Infrastructure (OWSAI)) založenou na evropských hodnotách, principech, legislativě a standardech&quot;.</span>

It feels like with every new batch of gaming news streams we get, they’re accompanied by memes about whichever game genre dominates the announcements and updates. Over the summer, there was an endless stream of dark space marine shooters, and after the news streams that rolled through this week, it seems there’s a new genre taking over the industry for the next few months: farming simulators.
Ooblets, I Am Future, Dreamlight Valley, Potion Permit, Bear and Breakfast, Witchbrook, My Time at Portia, Wytchwood, Homestead Arcana, Little Witch in the Woods, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life — the list of upcoming or newly released farming/community sims never-ending these days. This is excellent news for me, considering it’s one of my…</span>

                              <span>Stop the presses, that&#x27;s Big the Cat
A new teaser trailer went live today for Sonic Prime. The Netflix series follows Sonic and pals in some new adventures, though it looks like they&#x27;ll be dealing with some old villains in the process.
We&#x27;ve seen a few quick teasers of the upcoming series, but today&#x27;s teaser trailer shows a pretty hefty amount of Sonic Prime.
Notably, you can spot a few familiar faces in the teaser. Shadow the Hedgehog, Big the Cat, and of course, Eggman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JUb16YyU-04
It seems like there&#x27;s some kind of multi-verse, shattering of reality situation going on here. Whatever plans Eggman and other characters like Shadow are up to, Sonic will have to handle them.
The series is set to premiere this holiday season, and a landing page is live over on Netflix right now if you want to set up a reminder.
Year of the blue blur
It&#x27;s been quite the year for Sonic, all things considered. The movie franchise side of Sonic the Hedgehog has done quite well, and looks to be expanding further. Another movie is planned, which isn&#x27;t too surprising given the second film&#x27;s stinger, and a Knuckles series is on the way too.
On the video game side, Sonic fans already got a classic collection in Sonic Origins. And there&#x27;s Sonic Frontiers on the way as well, taking the high-speed action into the big open world.
It&#x27;s been a big year for fans of the blue hedgehog. And for Netflix, Sonic Prime could set a good tone for video game adaptations moving forward. The company&#x27;s had some great success with Castlevania, Arcane, and now Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. At least in terms of animation, the adaptations have been largely solid. While Sonic Prime is a bit more kid-friendly than those series, it&#x27;d be nice to see Sonic getting a solid series among all the adaptations coming out of Netflix.
Sonic Prime speeds onto Netflix later this year.

                              <span>Western localization in development
Edia, the developer/publisher behind Valis: The Fantasm Collection, has announced a Japanese release date for its next collection of obscurities: Cosmic Fantasy Collection — The double-header of PC Engine dungeon crawlers will launch on Nintendo Switch December 15. A localization is currently in the works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FgKpNzoqwG8
As previously reported, the Cosmic Fantasy Collection will consist of two titles: 1990&#x27;s Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu, and 1991&#x27;s TurboGrafx CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only game in the series to find its way to western shores, and remains something of an obscurity regardless, so retro gaming fans will definitely want to consider giving this new remaster a space on the radar.
The Cosmic Fantasy franchise would see relative success upon its debut in Japan, thanks to its quirky comedic style and obligatory love of naughty cheesecake fanservice. The series would spin off into several other adventures, and would also receive manga and anime adaptations, as well as a range of toys and merchandise. An intriguing little lost oddity in the annals of &#x27;90s gaming. Thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign, these forgotten titles will soon be experienced by a whole new generation of anime and RPG fans.

After being pushed back to a late November release, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is gearing up for a closed beta test on PC that will be playable from October 14–16 through Steam and the Microsoft Store. Say no more? Just bounce over to the beta sign-up page, add your email address, and fill out a questionnaire to determine your eligibility.
According to Fatshark, the beta test will &quot;throw everything but the kitchen sink at you to keep you at bay.&quot; This version has &quot;more content and features&quot; than the prior Tech Test.
That said, you won&#x27;t get to experience everything planned for the full release of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide — the developers are &quot;limiting weapons, maps and missions, enemy types, and other systems.&quot; And the progress you make in…</span>

Released for PC and consoles way back in 2017, Ark: Survival Evolved is — as its name denotes — a survival title set in an anachronistic prehistoric world. As a human outfitted with more modern technologies, players must build bases and habitats within a huge open world, gathering resources and increasing defenses while fending off attacks from rampaging packs of dinosaurs and potentially hostile human players. Players can also capture and tame dinosaurs for transpo…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not just studios being hoovered up
Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has announced that he has joined Chinese conglomerate Tencent in a new &quot;Strategic Advisor&quot; role. Layden announced his new gig on industry site LinkedIn.
According to Layden, his new role will see him &quot;advise, assist, and support the team at Tencent as they deepen their activities and commitments within the industry to which I’ve devoted the majority of my career.&quot;
&quot;We are at an epoch-defining moment in gaming and interactive entertainment,&quot; continued Layden. There are many possible roads ahead but only a few are profound, broadening, inclusive, edifying, inspiring, and/or sustainable. I am thrilled to continue this journey of discovery and thank Tencent for the opportunity.&quot;
Layden has held several high-ranking roles in PlayStation, including President and CEO of the industry giant&#x27;s U.S. operations. His final role with the company was as the chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, a position Layden left in 2019, citing concerns about burnout in an interview with Bloomberg.
Tencent has been in gaming&#x27;s headlines with incredible frequency, having made an aggressive push to expand both its portfolio of developers and publishers, while also pushing its operations further into western territories, no doubt Layden&#x27;s global experience will help Tencent in its endeavors.
Recent years have seen the holding company pick up outlets such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, Sumo Digital, and Funcom. Most recently, Tencent teamed with Sony to purchase a 30% stake in FromSoftware owners Kadokawa Group, and has also entered into a partnership with Ubisoft founders Guillemot Family.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s what happened
So roughly a week ago, Radiant Silvergun arrived on the Switch following a Nintendo Direct announcement. That&#x27;s good! But then it was quickly removed from sale. That&#x27;s bad! As of today though, that crisis has been averted, and Radiant Silvergun is now live on Switch.
So what went down with Radiant Silvergun on Switch? Thankfully, we have a full report from the publisher, Live Wire
The same day Radiant Silvergun went live on Switch, it was taken down. A lot of folks speculated that it was ratings-related, which was confirmed by the publisher several days later on Twitter: &quot;The reason it was removed from the store is because the product&#x27;s rating has changed. We have created new data and have already submitted it to them.&quot; The team also took the opportunity to begin to address some of the bugs that were present in the briefly-released port.
So after all that, the game is back up. The browser listing may not be live depending on your region, but the game is currently live on the actual Switch eShop.
It&#x27;s a good thing this was resolved, because Radiant Silvergun is an all-time classic shmup (shoot &#x27;em up), and it deserves to be on as many platforms as possible. Thankfully the eShop issue was minor, and the team has acknowledged this version&#x27;s bugs and is working on a fix.

                              <span>What&#x27;s in a name?
Last week was a biggie for Yakuza fans, as Sega and RGG Studio bombarded the community with exciting news pertaining to not only new titles in the dramatic RPG series, but also revealed some long-awaited news on the lost-in-translation side series, Yakuza: Ishin!.. erm... Like a Dragon: Ishin!
You see, as part of this cavalcade of series news, Sega also announced that it is officially adopting the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; branding (a closer approximation of their original Japanese title: Ryu ga Gotoku), for all Like a Dragon/Yakuza releases going forward. No more titles set within the Yakuza universe will be afforded the &quot;Yakuza&quot; name in any of their English localizations.

                              <span>As expected, Nvidia have announced the GeForce RTX 4090 during their GeForce Beyond livestream – and confirmed the RTX 4080 for good measure. Both GPUs are based on Nvidia’s new Ada Lovelace architecture, and will launch this year: the RTX 4090 on October 12th, and the RTX 4080 sometime in November. 


Key features of Ada Lovelace, and thus these new cards, include 3rd Gen RT cores, 4th Gen Tensor cores, and a new streaming multiprocessor. These supposedly add up to twice the performance of Ampere (that’s the RTX 30 series architecture currently dominating our best graphics card guide) in standard rasterised games, and up to four times the performance in ray traced games. And since Nvidia were clearly in a ray-tracey mood, they also took the opportunity to reveal Portal RTX: a semi-official mod for the original Portal that upgrades it with RT lighting and reflection effects. Corrrr.

Marvel announced the project with a single shadowy image of Iron Man and his shiny gamer highlights on Twitter. They described the game as an “all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure title”.

                              <span>Cheekily dropping the news two hours before Nvidia’s RTX 40 series showcase, AMD senior vice president Scott Herkelman has tweeted a date for the official reveal of the RDNA 3 graphics card generation: November 3rd 2022. That’s less than two weeks before we’ll see how AMD will combat the GeForce RTX 4090 and its brethren, most likely taking the form of the Radeon RX 7000 series of GPUs.

                              <span>One of the big reveals from last week’s Tokyo Games Show was Like A Dragon 8, the next in what we’ve been calling the Yakuza series. Except the game didn’t seem to be following the naming convention of its predecessor Yakuza: Like A Dragon, instead ditching the part associated with the Japanese crime syndicate. The head of series developers Ryu Ga Gotoku, Masayoshi Yokoyama, has since confirmed the change in a recent interview (thanks IGN).

That’s thanks to yet another uptick in production speed, according to a Steam Community post, so everyone whose delivery estimate was in Q3 2022 should now have received their confirmation email. Fulfilment of the final remaining Q4 batch is now fully underway, after a smaller handful of lucky Q4-ers were bumped forward into Q3.

The update also rebalances relics, improves UI and AI, and brings back Culture Workers.

Well, that’s exactly what’s happened for some of us today. Hyper Demon seems to be all about the disembodied, infernal craniums too, but don’t call it a sequel. Brace yourself as you watch the nightmarish trailer below. It&#x27;s a wild one.

                              <span>Apologies for reporting three-day-old-news (thanks, Bank Holiday weekend) but this is a rare surprise in the world of PC hardware: EVGA, longtime graphics card board partners to Nvidia, are getting out the GPU game entirely. What’s more, according an interview with Gamers Nexus, their reasoning is a lack of “respect” shown to them by Nvidia themselves. Suffice to say, there won’t be an EVGA version of the RTX 4090 or any RTX 40 series GPU that might be announced during Nvidia’s GeForce Beyond event later today.

It’s also emerged that the same hacker may have been responsible for a breach of rideshare platform Uber last week. Uber say they’re in contact with both the FBI and the U.S. Department Of Justice over the hacks.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog brand&#x27;s expansion throughout multimedia has given fans plenty to enjoy in recent years. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn&#x27;t show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it&#x27;s bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.</span>

Funkce je určená pro kvalitní náhodná čísla a již nějakou dobu nepoužívá arc4. Jason kritizoval spíše způsob inicializace (seed) a připravil rozhraní pro funkci getrandom() v jaderném vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object). Ta jde pak použít jednoduše i v user-space a má všechny výhody a bezpečnou náhodnou inicializaci jaderné implementace.</span>

                              <span>To plant my piratey flag up front, I am an extremely huge fan of the Monkey Island series, and am therefore almost exactly who Return To Monkey Island is aimed at. After several adventures with other devs, sometime-mighty pirate Guybrush Threepwood (a name that invites as many tedious jokes as Benedict Cumberbatch, which is a trap I won&#x27;t be falling into) is back with his some of his original progenitors Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman - Gilbert being the director for the first two Islands Monkey.
I was expecting Return To Monkey Island to be a delightful croquembouche of point and click puzzles artfully piled up with puns and meta jokes, all slathered in the sticky, sugary caramel of nostalgia. And it is that. But I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to contain a gentle rumination on getting old and figuring out what things are really worth caring about.

This specification packs in a Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, Radeon RX 6700S GPU, 1TB NVMe SSD, 16GB of DDR5 and a 14-in 1440p 120Hz screen - and it&#x27;s been discounted from $1650 to $1350, saving you $300. That&#x27;s an awesome price for this level of performance, all in a compact 14-in chassis that&#x27;s easy to tote around or work with on the go.

                              <span>The RTX 4090 is all but confirmed now, based on the sheer volume of leaks, rumours and speculation showing off the next-gen Nvidia GPU in a variety of guises but sharing the same specs. That&#x27;s pushed the prices of current-gen GPUs way down, and that&#x27;s especially true for high-end cards. Ergo, it&#x27;s not a massive surprise to see the Nvidia RTX 3090 Ti, Team Green&#x27;s flagship card, down to just $999 at Amazon after debuting at twice that figure.

One massive 1600W 80+ Platinum unit has been highly discounted over in the States, where the EVGA SuperNova 1600 P+ is down to $200 from its original price of $500. That&#x27;s an awesome deal on a power supply ideally suited for high-end, multiple-GPU systems - and doesn&#x27;t cost much more than a Platinum-rated 1000W PSU.

                              <span>A huge number of videos purporting to show in-game development footage for GTA 6 have been plastered across various internet forums this morning, because apparently no one can wait until a video game is actually anywhere near finished before they feel compelled to spoil it for all and sundry. 
The 80-some clips seemingly show everything from full, in-game scenarios to clearly unfinished bits of grey boxing, but you won&#x27;t find a link to them here, because the truth is, they&#x27;re simply not worth looking at. What possible benefit could they provide anyone right here, right now? The leaker gets their five minutes of fame and an influx of new followers, sure. But GTA 6 itself isn&#x27;t going to look anything like what you see in those clips when it&#x27;s actually finished, so someone please tell me, what is even the point?

                              <span>New research shared by the entertainment industry-backed Digital Citizens Alliance finds that 12% of all ads on pirate streaming sites are linked to malware. The problem is so bad that the researchers fell prey to multiple ransomware attacks. Intriguingly, the findings also suggest that pirate sites are &#x27;safer&#x27; than before, although that greatly depends on which studies you look at.

                              <span>Half-Life: Alyx demonstrated that Valve&#x27;s first-person shooter series could work in virtual reality, but who knows when Valve will release another one. Thankfully some modders have stepped in to fill the void. There&#x27;s now a publicly playable beta of Half-Life 2: VR Mod available on Steam that makes the nearly 20-year-old shooter playable with a headset and motion controllers.

                              <span>Castle Dimitrescu was one of the many highlights of Resident Evil Village, so it makes sense that Capcom are returning to it in the game&#x27;s upcoming DLC adventure, Shadows Of Rose. Set 16 years after the events of Village, this story expansion centres on Rose, the daughter of Village protagonist Ethan Winters, as she comes to terms with her emerging mold powers. She was just a teeny, tiny baby when her dad was fighting off the very tall vampire lady in the base game, but now she&#x27;s all grown up and wants to be rid of the supernatural spore abilities that have been plaguing her family ever since the events of Resident Evil 7. 
It&#x27;s not yet clear what role Lady D&#x27;s castle has to play in Rose&#x27;s journey, but man, it sure is nice to be back roaming its ornate hallways again. Or rather it would be, if it weren&#x27;t for all the ashen mold men stalking its corridors, and its rather gross (but strangely hypnotic) rivers of undulating strawberry jam gore that have been plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Ach, now it&#x27;s on my shoes. Great. And the gate&#x27;s locked behind me. Fantastic. I knew coming back here would be a bad idea…

Why do I always let my holiday days slide down and clump at the end of the year. Better make the most of comfortable swimming and cycling while I still can.

Both parties have now submitted their statement of claims to the jury. The record labels believe that the ISP is liable and seek significant damages. Grande disputes this assertion, noting that it never induced or encouraged subscribers to pirate anything.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of this week&#x27;s announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane.

                              <span>Logitech&#x27;s G29 racing wheel and pedals is down to $230 at Amazon, offering a great chance to pick up a highly-regarded budget wheel at a fair price. 
The G29 set works with PC, PS4 and PS5, making it a good pickup for anyone with at least one of these systems that likes to play titles like Gran Turismo 7 or F1 22. There&#x27;s also an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC model, the G920, that&#x27;s available at the same discounted price and of course will work well for games like Forza Horizon 5, F1 22 and the upcoming Forza Motorsport scheduled to arrive early next year.

                              <span>Higher speed, lower latency DDR5 is becoming more affordable, and in the US we spotted a great deal on TeamGroup memory over at Amazon. There, you can find a 32GB kit of DDR5-5600 CL36 memory for $150, reduced from its normal price of $180. That&#x27;s more expensive than 32GB of DDR4, but you&#x27;re getting a substantial increase in bandwidth and reduction in latency compared to the DDR5-4800 CL40 JEDEC standard.

                              <span>Man, I was worried this week. I&#x27;ve had a string of possible reports that were all disappointingly tepid. Then I played Trail Out, a chaotic crash-and-ram racing game with, for some reason, a story mode about a former stunt driver who is very much some guy. I&#x27;m still not sure if he&#x27;s talking to himself, through the fourth wall, or to his dog. His best friend wears a gas mask and lifts weights in the junkyard without breaking eye contact.
The racing is very solid, but more importantly it has character. Odd, odd character.

Once again, we&#x27;re bringing a load of games with strange and interesting custom controllers or unique physical experiences. Pool on a bendy table! A game about growing a plant by directing light! Morse code! The many buttons of Tenya Wanya Teens! Something involving neckties? You&#x27;ll find these and more at RPS Future Of Play during EGX London, running September 22-25th.

                              <span>Free to play MMO action RPG Lost Ark is getting a round in today, as the game’s Arktoberfest event begins. An in-game celebration of all things Bavarian that’s riffing on the actual Oktoberfest, Arktoberfest runs until October 3rd. It’ll bring themed festival foods to the game, along with some staggeringly well-balanced beer steins. Arktoberfest is the first big event to come to Lost Ark in the West that wasn&#x27;t in the original Korean and Russian version of the game.

                              <span>The Steam Deck’s Asia release has taken it to the Tokyo Game Show, following a solo launch event that included several surviving Steam Deck prototypes. In my report on the latter I made some passing references to a novelty oversized Deck that Valve were building for their TGS booth, completely unaware of how often I’d find myself admiring it a few days later. See, the Steam Deck booth at TGS, from the towering scale model to the weirdly impressive elegance of its logistics, might be the finest event booth I’ve ever seen.

                              <span>Clearly in direct response to that one moan I had about the lack of reliable GeForce RTX 40 series info, Nvidia are now teasing what’s very likely a launch event for their next generation of GPUs. The official Nvidia GeForce Twitter account has been vagueposting about something called #ProjectBeyond, starting with a coded image on September 8th and more recently listing a date and time: 8am PDT (4pm BST) on September 20th.
Given it’s about time in Nvidia’s preferred biannual cycle for a new graphics card generation, and it being the GeForce account rather than one of Nvidia’s non-gaming brands, and Nvidia also dropping the cryptic stuff and just straight-up confirming a &quot;GeForce Beyond&quot; show on the 20th, you can bet your sweet memory bus that September 20th will see some kind of RTX GPU announcement. The RTX 30 series, which has contributed most of the past two years’ best graphics cards, will finally begin its journey into semi-retirement.

                              <span>Yesterday at the Tokyo Games Show, Capcom formally announced the addition of Ken, Blanka, E.Honda and Dhalsim to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Technically, none of this should come as a surprise. Not only are they all Street Fighter faithfuls, but pretty much the entire cast list got leaked back in June thanks to some rogue character art. One thing that has been pleasantly surprising, however, is learning that Ken, pictured in that leaked document as looking rather dishevelled and rocking a bit of a &#x27;sad, middle-aged dad&#x27; look, is anything but.
Indeed, when I went to play the latest build of Street Fighter 6 at Capcom&#x27;s UK offices earlier in the week, Ken was absolutely killing it. Rather than suffering from a mid-life crisis, Ken was hauling it across the screen like an absolute battering ram, clearly full of the same mad protein shakes his mate Ryu&#x27;s been hawking down since their last SF outing, as both of them have gone full-on Redfield Beefcake this time.

While there’s some new monsters to square off against, I feel the most critically important part of the update is the layered weapons system. This gives you the option to unsheathe some truly bizarre weaponry, including something that appears to be a comically huge ear of sweet corn. Witness for yourself by watching the trailer below.

Your adventure unfolds by making decisions using cards which represent allies, resources, and events, which often have weird and surprising consequences. Weirdly, the game it most reminds me of is Townscaper: throw pieces together, uncertain what will happen, then be surprised and delighted what the system produces. Like accidentally making your cowboy confess his love for his horse, leading to a fresh new baby horse card in your hand. Oh no.

                              <span>I’ve always thought each of the sixteen colossi in Shadow Of The Colossus is kinda cute in their own special way. There’s just something about the animal-like antics of those immense, lumbering creatures that make them naturally adorable, even though they wouldn’t hesitate in breaking every single bone in my small, weak body.
Zürich-based developers Stray Fawn Studio totally get what I’m on about, and have created their own lovable rocky giant in their city-building sim The Wandering Village. Their creature, Onbu, is a colossal six-legged beast, and the walking platform on which your village sits, a plateau of flat land mass on its back making for an excellent settlement ground. Onbu is best described as a gentle giant. They move slowly but carefully, love to munch on fields of wild mushrooms, nap in meadows of soft pink flowers, and tuck in their paws and tail when sleeping.

                              <span>Tokyo Game Show provided an opportunity to try out the latest build of Street Fighter 6. Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic. She’s also set to play a pivotal role in t…</span>

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smi…</span>

                              <span>I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…</span>

                              <span>Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won&#x27;t tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we&#x27;re getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it&#x27;s E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there&#x27;s some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you&#x27;ve never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we&#x27;d love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!</span>

And speaking of Resident Evil 4 Remake, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed during Tokyo Game Show that the remake will also be coming to PlayStation 4, as reported by GameSpot. 
When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Now the company has confirmed that the game will be available on PS4 when it launches on March 24, 2023. There&#x27;s no word if Resident Evil 4 Remake will come to Xb…</span>

                              <span>Konami has revealed Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here&#x27;s hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game&#x27;s Steam page:

                              <span>Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion was a funny, Zelda-like todo list of a game that won serveral RPS staff over last year. Now it&#x27;s getting a &quot;follow-up spin-off&quot; which adds roguelite and top-down shooter elements into the mix, called Turnip Boy Robs A Bank. Watch the reveal trailer below.

Integrating numbers from HowLongToBeat, most Game Pass games&#x27; pages now suggests how long a game is in several playstyles: finishing the main story; doing the main story and optional extras; and absolutely 100%ing everything. While I usually find talk of game length is tied into awful opinions that longer is better, I think this is great info to know on Game Pass.

The 5000X normally costs quite a bit - the RRP is £220 and even discounts drop it to £155+ - but today it&#x27;s down to £116.66 when you buy from Box via Amazon.
That could be a misprice, given the vast price discrepancy between the RRP and sale price. With only two units available you&#x27;ll have to move fast to pick this one up...

                              <span>This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we, prompted by friendly listener OurSuperior, talk about the best changes of eras in games. As you can imagine, this is an easier task for Nate than it is to me, because many of his favourite games are predicated around era changes. Thus I find myself in the position of arguing semantics. How the turn tables have turned.
I&#x27;m able to win Nate around on at least one of my desperate bids to classify things that aren&#x27;t eras as eras, although he does promptly shut me down on the most ridiculous one. It may surprise you to know that we don&#x27;t actually talk about too many history games (although time travel comes up a lot). And stick around for a thrilling Cavern Of Lies. Will the Red Baron (me) be shot down at last?

                              <span>One of the best 1000W computer power supplies is going cheap(er) on Amazon today, as the EVGA SuperNova 1000 P6 has dropped from £200 to £150. That&#x27;s an excellent price for a well-reviewed unit with 80+ Platinum efficiency and a fully modular design - not to mention a surprisingly compact ATX design that will work in a wide range of PC cases.

That’s the message from dev Toby Fox, who’s posted an update on how Deltarune’s coming along. Fox’s message to those eagerly awaiting more from the game was published to mark the seventh anniversary of his indie RPG smash Undertale. It shares some new screens, GIFs, a video and even some tunes.

                              <span>Hand Of Fate was such a singular thing. On the one hand, it was a tabletop deckbuilding game that saw you picking through roguelike-style dungeons by choosing different cards dealt out by its mysterious Dealer. On the other, it was also an action-packed hack and slasher, bringing its fantastical fight sections to life in fully 3D combat arenas - and there hasn&#x27;t been anything quite like it since. Voice Of Cards certainly had a go, but its tedious battle system landed it straight on its own discard pile. Thankfully, we&#x27;ve now got the infinitely more engaging Foretales, a new narrative card game from French developers Alkemi, and it comes pretty damn close to capturing that Hand Of Fate goodness. 
It doesn&#x27;t ever venture into the realms of 3D admittedly, erring more toward the Inscryption school of tabletop combat encounters, but it does nail the delivery of telling an artful, swashbuckling adventure through cards and cards alone. And much like Hand Of Fate, this isn&#x27;t a one and done affair, either, as there are multiple paths to take through this entertaining fantasy yarn, and several game-changing decisions you&#x27;ll have to make as you try and avert a string of terrible visions threatening to destroy its anthropomorphic animal world. You won&#x27;t succeed at preventing them all during a single playthrough, but its hard choices only make its overarching story that much more gripping.

Oh, and there’s crossplay across all platforms and stores too. Watch the new trailer below.

                              <span>Disney Dreamlight Valley is a glittering life simulator in which you — having somehow slipped out of the real world into a kind of Disney-sponsored coma — find yourself living alongside all of your favourite intellectual property. Your mission? Emotionally manipulate the awful dog-beast Goofy by gifting him dandelions and bream until he becomes your best friend, then set about working on Scrooge McDuck and the rest.
Before we dive too far into this thing: if you’re here because you’ve got a kid and you just want to know if Disney Dreamlight Valley will make them happy, and that the rat from Ratatouille doesn’t say the f-word, and that at no point does Ariel drag herself onto the beach to try to recruit them into a multi-level marketing scam, then you’re golden. Disney Dreamlight Valley is a top-marks Animal Crossing rip-off that will make fans of too-big mice irreversibly giddy. Your children may eventually need a special operation to stop them smiling.

In simple terms, Chinese authorities are only concerned when a crime occurs inside China.

During today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That&#x27;s when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that&#x27;s all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


&quot;[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game&#x27;s four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.&quot;
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass&#x27; free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko&#x27;s Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.
Kitsune Rush – Summon a fox spirit that rushes forward, accelerating the movement, attack speed, and cooldowns of allies that follow its path.
Wall Climb – Jump at walls to climb up them. 
Season 1 of Overwatch 2 releases for free on October 4 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.

It feature more Sonic Frontiers gameplay, which consists of the blue blur climbing colossal machines as if they&#x27;re mountains, but when he reaches the top of one, he stumbles upon something very special: a Chaos Emerald. As any Sonic fan likely knows, collecting all of these will help the hedgehog transform into Super Sonic, a Saiyan-like version of the character that&#x27;s faster and stronger. And sure enough, that&#x27;s exactly what happens in this new TGS Sonic Frontiers trailer. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, this is the first appearance of Super Sonic in Sonic Frontiers&#x27; marketing thus far. It&#x27;s also the first confirmation that Super Sonic is in the game. This trailer is another exciting Sonic Frontiers trailer showcasing more of what we can expect when the game hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced that its Yakuza-adjacent Judgment series will make its way to Steam for the first time. The best news: they&#x27;re out on Steam today.
Judgment and Lost Judgment come to Steam on September 14. This marks the first appearance of each game on PC (though Judgment has been available to stream on PC via Stadia). 
This news is especially significant given that RGG Studio originally planned to release Lost Judgment on PC when it launched last year. However, that version was nixed when the talent agency representing actor Takuya Kimura, who portrays protagonist Takayuki Yagami, enforced strict policies about allowing Kimura’s likeness on PC. Both parties&#x27; inability to agree threatened Judgment’s future as a franchise since RGG Studio has pushed for more of its titles to come to Steam; every mainline Yakuza game is available on the storefront, for example. It would appear those issues have been ironed out, which bodes well for the potential of a third game. 
The Judgment games are noir action thrillers that adhere to the same open-world design template as the Yakuza series. Though the plots largely unfold in Kamurocho, the series stars a new cast of characters and emphasizes investigative gameplay. Players control Yagami, a disgraced lawyer and private detective who works to unravel a pair of conspiracy plots. In Yakuza fashion, he also has his hands full helping his colorful clients and random citizens solve more light-hearted – or comically absurd – problems.

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise, revealed yesterday that it&#x27;s remaking Like A Dragon: Ishin and releasing it for the first time in the West next year. That reveal trailer looked great, but it was short and sweet. 
Now, RGG has released a new &quot;Ambush&quot; trailer that showcases more than five minutes of Like A Dragon: Ishin, giving us a better look at this upcoming Yakuza spinoff. Like A Dragon: Ishin was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014, but it never came out in the West. This new release rebuilds Like A Dragon: Ishin from the ground up, and you can check out how great it&#x27;s looking in the trailer below: 


Like A Dragon: Ishin takes place in the Late Edo Period of Japan, in the 1860s. After completing his special sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns to his home in Tosa, only to find conflict against a prestigious samurai. You can read more about it in our story here.
Like A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21.</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Yakuza 8 is called Like A Dragon 8 today, and that game&#x27;s announcement trailer revealed that former series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu is back alongside Yakuza: Like A Dragon protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Now, RGG has announced Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, a new Yakuza game that will follow Kiryu&#x27;s life following the events of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life leading up to Like A Dragon 8. 
In the reveal trailer, which aired today during the RGG Summit 2022 showcase, we see Kiryu at a monastery. Having left behind his former Yakuza life, as well as his name, Kiryu, who now goes by Joryu, is trying to live the life of a monk. However, he&#x27;s seemingly pulled into one more job – an escort mission – and if today&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8 trailer is any indication, it seems this final job pulls him back into the life he had put behind him. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, The Man Who Erased His Name is shaping up to be a treat for longtime Yakuza fans and it seems like necessary playing in the leadup to 2024&#x27;s Like A Dragon 8. Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2023.

When I played the original version of Resident Evil Village on PlayStation 5, I didn’t pay too much attention to the environmental details, like this painting. In this playthrough, I am frequently distracted by them. Even though this version is essentially the same game, it takes on new life through PSVR2’s stunning display.
The headset’s OLED display delivers a wide 110-degree field of view capable of presenting games in vivid 4K HDR. Unlike most VR headsets on the market, I’m not seeing any general pixelization, artifacting, or graininess in the text – everything looks sharp.

                              <span>The eighth mainline installment in the popular and long-running Yakuza franchise has been revealed and it&#x27;s called Like A Dragon 8. 
Set up as a direct sequel to 2020&#x27;s Yakuza: Like A Dragon, which starred a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and turn-based RPG mechanics rather than brawler combat, it was a hit amongst fans. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s no surprise Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is following it up with another Like A Dragon game. Check out the Like A Dragon 8 reveal trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, the former protagonist of Yakuza, Kazuma Kiryu, is back. He was the protagonist in the first six Yakuza games, and now he&#x27;s back in Like A Dragon 8. Ichiban tells Kiryu it&#x27;s Hero time – remember, he&#x27;s a big fan of the Dragon Quest series which stars plenty of heroes – before the trailer cuts to both of their faces, revealing that some time has passed, with both characters looking at least a little older than when we last saw them. 
Like A Dragon 8 is due out PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC sometime in 2024. 
In the meantime, read about Like A Dragon: Ishin, a Yakuza spinoff first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 finally making its way to the West, rebuilt from the ground up, next year.</span>

                              <span>Today brought a doubleheader of platform-holder livestreams. Our day kicked off with a Nintendo Direct, which brought us more than 40 minutes of headlines, gameplay trailers, announcements, and even name reveals. We finished off the day with a PlayStation State of Play, giving us trailers and information for the PlayStation family of consoles, including PlayStation VR2.
Now that the dust has settled a little bit, we want to know what caught your eye. Was it something from Nintendo&#x27;s digital event? Perhaps the name and release date reveal of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom? Was the impressive list of Nintendo 64 games coming to Switch Online&#x27;s Expansion Pack? Maybe you&#x27;re super hyped for Fire Emblem Engage?
Or was it something from the PlayStation State of Play event? Tekken 8 was an expected but exciting reveal, while games like Rise of the Ronin and Like a Dragon: Ishin look like an absolute blast. Of course, we can&#x27;t talk about the State of Play stream without mentioning that God of War: Ragnarök footage.
Let us know in the comments below what you&#x27;re most hyped about coming out of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play. If you happened to miss any of the announcements, you can check out our news hub for all our coverage from today.</span>

                              <span>Sony revealed a brand new story trailer for God Of War Ragnarök during today’s State Of Play stream. The video showcased otherworldly imagery, including astral jellyfish, giant dinosaur-like creatures, and notably, a pivotal scene wherein Atreus appears to usher in Fimbulwinter, the end of the world, alongside Sköll and Hati – two wolves that are the offspring of Fenrir. According to Norse mythology, Sköll and Hati are two wolves who exist to one day spark the beginning of Ragnarök by chasing and devouring the sun and the moon. It’s pretty clear that’s what is happening in this new trailer, but why is Atreus helping them?
Additionally, it seems Atreus is hiding critical information from his father, Kratos, so why is Kratos following orders from his teenage son? Why is Freya holding a sword up to Atreus’ throat in the trailer? Is she holding Atreus hostage or trying to show Kratos the same pain she suffered after her son Baldur was killed in the first game? The trailer creates more questions than answers, precisely what I want from pre-launch marketing. 


We’ll have to wait to find the answers to these questions when God Of War Ragnarök releases on November 8. In the meantime, let me know your story theories in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the beloved Yakuza franchise, has announced Like a Dragon: Ishin. This spin-off entry was first released on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 in 2014 but never came to the West. Now titled Like A Dragon: Ishin, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, and it&#x27;s coming to Western markets next year.


The game takes place in the Late Edo Period, in the 1860s. After finishing his sword training, Sakamoto Ryoma returns home to Tosa, only to get into a fight with a prestigious and highly ranked samurai. Now, players can change the course of Japan&#x27;s history in this Yakuza spin-off game.
Like a Dragon: Ishin is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February 2023.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation and Team Ninja have announced Rise of the Ronin, a new action game coming exclusively to PlayStation 5 sometime in 2024. 
It was revealed during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, and if you&#x27;re at all familiar with Team Ninja&#x27;s other games, you&#x27;re probably going to be into this one. It&#x27;s not quite clear if it&#x27;s taking up the Soulslike mantle that other Team Ninja games have (looking at you, Nioh), but there were a few gameplay sequences that showed some combat similar to From Software&#x27;s hit series. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Rise of the Ronin looks quite interesting. The combat looks fast, brutal, and explosive, and the characters look fun. The world looks especially unique, too, with some of the game seemingly taking place in more rural areas of Japan and others taking place in more dense villages and towns.

Unfortunately, it might be a while before we learn more because Rise of the Ronin won&#x27;t hit PlayStation 5 until 2024.

                              <span>Grim futuristic worlds do love their giant robots, and newly revealed third-person mech battler Synduality is no exception to that. The game’s part of a “transmedia sci-fi franchise” being worked on by very bluntly named devs Game Studio, according to publishers Bandai Namco. The game’s out in 2023, though. Suit up and boot up by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>At risk of turning RPS into a Ryu Ga Gotoku fansite today, I must inform you that the rumoured release of the Judgment series on PC has happened. Available now on PC through Steam, The Judgment Collection includes Judgment, its sequel Lost Judgment, and The Kaito Files story expansion all into one handy bundle. That sure is a whole lot of judgment. Watch the trailer below for more than your daily recommended dose of kick-punching action.

As much as I admire delicious dishes, I am very glad that something that&#x27;s wholly unintentional (and often unwanted by developers) is still in the running. Games are weird and daft magic tracks, and that&#x27;s great. This week, you must choose between oddity and serendipity. What&#x27;s better: impossible geometry, or games playing the music CD left in your drive?

I’ve already reported on Like A Dragon 8, which stars Kiryu and new series main character Ichiban Kasuga, but devs Ryu Go Gotoku Studio also revealed that another game is coming in 2023. It&#x27;ll explain what happened to Kiryu in his temporary absence from the series and is called, and I’m not making this up, Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. To prove it to you, you can watch the trailer below.

It shows off the weird, wonderful and complex ways you can look for love in all the wrong places in Fallen London. Although, as you can see in the trailer, you can also look for friendship, attraction, romance, or a combination of the latter two. Plus: mystery! Who isn&#x27;t intrigued by a romance game where someone utters the immortal phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s been a murder&quot;?

The Yakuza spin-off set in 1860s Japan was first released in 2014, and the remake is described as having been &quot;rebuilt from the ground up&quot;. Watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has revealed Tekken 8, a new sequel in the popular and long-running fighting game franchise. 
Tekken 8 was revealed in a new cinematic trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. It began with a few shots to set up the scenery before cutting to two series mainstays, Kazuya and Kazuya&#x27;s son, Jin. The two duke it out in what appears to be a fair fight, that is until Kazuya calls forth the power of the devil gene inside him to finish the fight. 
Check it out for yourself in the reveal trailer below:


Unfortunately, this trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal much else. Tekken 8 looks very much like Tekken, which is great. The trailer also doesn&#x27;t reveal a release date – it just says to stay tuned for more information.

                              <span>As one of the most influential and beloved shooters of all time, GoldenEye 007 is a special game for many who played it in the late &#x27;90s. However, it&#x27;s been a long time since the game has been playable on modern consoles. That changes soon, as the revolutionary first-person shooter received a duo of announcements today. First, we learned about a Switch version as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack N64 catalog. However, we also learned the title (which was developed by now-Microsoft-owned Rare), is also coming to Xbox as a part of Game Pass and Rare Replay.
When the game arrives on Xbox, it will include the classic campaign, complete with the original difficulty settings and cheat codes (no word on if &quot;DK Mode&quot; will be renamed to something more generic like &quot;Big Head Mode&quot; for the Xbox version). The Xbox version will also include the split-screen local competitive multiplayer mode that made the game such a mainstay for get-togethers in the N64 era.


Unfortunately, it does not appear as though the online multiplayer available in the Nintendo Switch Online version will make the jump to the Xbox version. However, the Xbox version of GoldenEye 007 does include improved control options (including dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
GoldenEye 007 is coming to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One as part of Game Pass. Everyone who already owns Rare Replay will also be able to download the game at no additional cost. We don&#x27;t know exactly when GoldenEye 007 arrives on Xbox, but according to Rare, the game will land simultaneously on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch Online.</span>

                              <span>I never thought I would write these words: I&#x27;m leaving Game Informer.
For nearly 30 years, I looked forward to each workday, eager to see what game news would break, what I would be writing about, and on the best days, what I would be playing. In the time it took to create 330 monthly magazines, I was privileged to work alongside some of the most talented and amazing people I&#x27;ve ever met. For a kid who couldn’t get enough of video games growing up, I was living a dream. I knew how lucky I was and never took it for granted. I worked hard. I wanted Game Informer to be the place to go to celebrate games. I think we accomplished that tenfold and have created an outlet unlike any other.
In the weeks ahead, I’ll transition from writing game news to creating it. I’m entering the world of game dev…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re rapidly approaching the midway point for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Booster Course Pass content. With two of the six promised waves of new courses already out, Nintendo has begun teasing what players can expect with the third wave, which is due out this holiday season. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we learned the first two courses coming in the third eight-course wave of new tracks.
Fittingly, the first course we learned about for Wave 3 of the Booster Course Pass is Merry Mountain. This holiday-themed track first made its debut in Mario Kart Tour in 2020 as part of the Winter Tour. Meanwhile, for those looking for something not holiday-themed, Nintendo is also bringing Peach Gardens, a track that first appeared in Mario Kart DS in 2005.
Wave 1 brought fan favorites like Coconut Mall (Wii), Choco Mountain (N64), and Sky Garden (GBA), while Wave 2 gave us access to tracks like Kalimari Desert (N64), Mario Circuit 3 (SNES), and Mushroom Gorge (Wii). Each wave has also given us two tracks from Mario Kart Tour, with Wave 2 also including an all-new course in Sky-High Sundae. 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass Wave 3 is scheduled to arrive this holiday season.</span>

                              <span>In the lead-up to Nintendo Switch Sports, Nintendo promised two major free updates following the launch. The first free update, which came out earlier this summer, added the ability to use the leg strap accessory for entire soccer matches instead of just shootouts. The second, more anticipated free update is set to add a new playable sport to the package: golf. Originally set for release this fall, Nintendo today announced a small delay to the update, saying it now arrives this holiday season.
The Nintendo Switch Sports version of golf lets you tee up across 21 holes carried over from the Wii Sports series. You can play locally with other players or hit the links with up to eight players online in the new Survival Golf mode. In Survival Golf, whoever takes the most strokes each round is eliminated.
This free update to Nintendo Switch Sports arrives this holiday season. For more about Nintendo Switch Sports, you can check out our full review here.</span>

In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, players can explore the surface of the version of Hyrule they traveled across in Breath of the Wild as well as various floating islands in the sky. In the new trailer, we see Link go from the sky to the surface, then from the surface to the sky.
There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but in addition to the official name, we also now have a release date. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingom arrives exclusively on Nintendo Switch on May 12, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Dauntless developer Phoneix Labs has announced a new title that, needless to say, is dramatically different than its monster-slaying RPG. Fae Farm is a cozy life simulation that whisks players to a world of magic and wonder where you&#x27;ll flex your green thumb as a farming savior. 


As the name suggests, the bulk of the experience involves running a farm as an adventurer and newcomer to a community in the land of Azoria. Though you’ll work to bring peace to this troubled land, you’ll also kick back and leisurely explore various environments, collect resources, and build homesteads. Fae Farm is built with cooperation in mind. The title features drop-in/drop-out co-op, both locally and online, allowing players to farm and quest together. 
“With Fae Farm we wanted to take our favorite elements of the sim genres we love, infuse them with magic and beautiful art, and wrap everything in a light-hearted cooperative experience,” said creative director Katie De Sousa in a press release. “I can’t wait to see what kind of cozy homesteads players build in Azoria.”
Fae Farm is slated to release during Q2 2023 exclusively for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was loaded with surprises, including an enhanced port of the 2011 Wii game, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land. On this colorful adventure, Kirby uses a variety of copy abilities to solve puzzles and platforming challenges. These abilities, like a sword and whip, can also be used for combat encounters. This updated version of the game also includes a new Mecha ability, which adds long-range rockets, a close-range dash, and a mighty blast to the arsenal.
Up to four people can play cooperatively using Joy-Cons on the same system. Multiplayer is also available in the expanded minigame collection, giving players a new challenge called Magolor&#x27;s Tome Trackers.
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Switch on February 24, 2023. Preorders begin today.</span>

                              <span>Capcom is bringing its best horror games to Nintendo Switch later this year via the handheld&#x27;s cloud gaming capabilities. Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and the recent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 will all be available on the eShop before the end of 2022. While we don&#x27;t know every game&#x27;s exact release date, Capcom announced that Resident Evil Village Cloud is launching on October 28. Additionally, a free demo of Village will be available later today on the Switch eShop if you&#x27;d like to test the quality of the cloud version yourself. 
This release coincides with the global launch of the Resident Evil Village Winter&#x27;s Expansion, which introduces new story content surrounding the protagonist&#x27;s daughter, which is also arriving on October 28. However, the expansion won&#x27;t be available to play on the Nintendo Switch cloud until December 2.</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing this: Pikmin 4 is real, and it&#x27;s out next year. 
Let&#x27;s get right to it – check out the official Pikmin 4 announcement trailer below: 


Here&#x27;s what Nintendo had to say about Pikmin 4 in a press release following today&#x27;s reveal: 
 
Pikmin franchise revealed a tranquil park and a napping Bulborb, but it was still missing one important element … Pikmin! Where could they be? More details about this new title for Nintendo Switch will be revealed ahead of its 2023 launch.&quot;

 
Pikmin is a very special franchise to many people, but despite its niche popularity, it&#x27;s never quite reached the heights of other Nintendo franchises. In total, the franchise has sold more than 8 million copies. Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch proved the franchise still had some (fruit) juice in it by selling roughly 2 million units in less than a year – a quarter of the series&#x27; entire sales – and fans speculated this had proved to Nintendo that it was time for a proper sequel. 
Pikmin 4 was mentioned by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto back in 2015 when he told Eurogamer that it was in development and &quot;very close to completion.&quot; Time passed and then Hey! Pikmin, a 2D Pikmin spinoff, was announced and then released in July of 2017. Some speculated that this was the Pikmin 4 Miyamoto was referring to back in 2015 but in June of that year, Miyamoto told Eurogamer that &quot;it is progressing,&quot; seemingly confirming that he did not view Hey! Pikmin as the fourth sequel. Unfortunately, that was the last Nintendo or anyone there referred to Pikmin 4...until today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct!

Nintendo showcased a short and sweet teaser trailer that gave us more of the luscious world of Pikmin before flashing to a title screen that revealed Pikmin 4 is coming to Switch next year. As for exactly when, that remains unknown  – Nintendo simply stated 2023. But hey, that&#x27;s better than wondering when, if ever, Pikmin 4 would actually come out!

                              <span>Square Enix has announced Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, the next entry in the Final Fantasy rhythm series. This first console entry in the series includes modernized visuals for the backgrounds and nearly 400 songs included in the base game.
The soundtrack includes favorites like &quot;One Winged Angel,&quot; &quot;Torn from the Heavens,&quot; &quot;Suteki Da Ne,&quot; and plenty more. With 385 songs included in the base game, Square Enix understands it might be difficult to sort through them all, so it included a way to sort by game. The game can be enjoyed by two players locally or four players online.


Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes to PlayStation 4 and Switch on February 16. Square Enix also announced that players can look forward to paid DLC from the Saga, Nier, Octopath Traveler, and Live A Live series for a total of 90 additional songs. There&#x27;s also a Season Pass which will add 27 extra songs.</span>

More specifically, the first post-launch Splatfest will begin at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET, on Sept. 23 and end at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sept. 25. As for what we&#x27;ll be fighting for, you can choose to be on team Gear, Grub, of Fun (in regards to what you&#x27;d bring with you to a deserted island). It should be a great time if the pre-launch Splatfest held recently is any indication.
Check out the Splatfest trailer for yourself below: 


The trailer above also reveals that some additional Splatoon 3 updates are on the way, too, although it stopped short of telling us exactly what to expect.

                              <span>On November 4, Hazelight and Electronic Arts&#x27; It Takes Two launches on Switch. This heartwarming adventure originally released in 2021 on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles. It received a 9.25 out of 10 review from Game Informer and also won The Game Awards&#x27; 2021&#x27;s Game of the Year honors.
It Takes Two can only be played cooperatively and can either be played on a single Switch via splitscreen or on two Switches via local wireless or online via the free friend&#x27;s pass.
In my review of the Xbox One version, I said &quot;It Takes Two may not be the platforming juggernaut that it aspires to be, but it more than makes up for it with its big heart, wealth in variety, and gorgeous imagery. All of its individual actions are things we’ve done in other games, but when applied to this distinct cooperative approach, they take on a whole new life and are used in wonderful ways over a long adventure. The action will have you laughing and screaming at your TV, and the story stays strong throughout, creating the backbone for an entertaining adventure that roars with excitement and should keep you glued to the controller to see if this couple’s lost love can be rekindled.&quot;
Preoders for the Switch version begin today.</span>

It seems Nintendo is ready to take us back to that world and its excellent HD-2D visual style because it announced Octopath Traveler II is coming to Switch February 24, 2023. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


As you can see, Octopath Traveler II is looking great, as expected. Rather than picking up with our previous heroes, this sequel presents us with eight new travelers: the warrior Hikari, the dancer Agnea, the merchant Partitio, the scholar Osvald, the thief Throné, the cleric Temenos, t…</span>

                              <span>Cyberpunk 2077 is having a bit of a resurgence at the moment. CD Projekt Red&#x27;s 2077 anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, developed by Studio Trigger and Netflix is out (as of today!) and the Phantom Liberty expansion for the game is due out next year. While Phantom Liberty has been confirmed to be 2077&#x27;s first and only expansion, it seems CDPR is not yet ready to part with this world. 
During the CD Projekt Group H1 2022 earnings call, CDPR&#x27;s vice president of business development Michał Nowakowski said the studio is committed to doing more with this IP, as reported by IGN. 


&quot;We decided to develop one major expansion for Cyberpunk, which is going to take advantage of all the capabilities of the new-gen consoles,&quot; Nowakowski said during the call. &quot;Having said that, we&#x27;re totally, fully committed to developing the Cyberpunk IP further, beyond this particular Cyberpunk expansion. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort and time into building this franchise and we definitely want to continue to build upon what was built right now – with new stories, new experiences, new content, basically. Not just the video game format...in terms of expansions, there&#x27;s just going to be one major expansion. However, there&#x27;s going to be new stuff in the future.&quot; 
As for what exactly, only time will tell but considering a Cyberpunk 2077 anime is already out, perhaps the studio is looking to dive more into the entertainment medium with this IP. As IGN notes, there&#x27;s also The Molasses Flood, a Boston-based studio that CDPR acquired earlier this year, which is working on an existing CDPR IP. This could be something related to The Witcher, of course, but perhaps it&#x27;s something related to 2077. 
In the meantime, read about why now is the right time to play Cyberpunk 2077 and then read about what to expect in next year&#x27;s Phantom Liberty expansion.

At the time, the announcement said the decision to delay was taken &quot;in light of recent events&quot;, referencing without directly naming the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Well, as of today, Little Orpheus, which is a scifi adventure about a Soviet cosmonaut in 1962, has been released.

Well, now it looks like Yakuza&#x27;s detective agency spin-offs are also heading to PC, as 2018&#x27;s Judgment and 2021&#x27;s Lost Judgment have both received an ESRB rating for &quot;Windows PC&quot;.

                              <span>The XIII remake, when it was released in 2020, was a disaster. Players complained of poor AI, bugs, missing multiplayer and an art style that abandoned the iconic, cel-shaded look of the original. After almost two years of further work by a different developer, the remake of the XIII remake is now live.

Not to be confused with the unrelated Remothered games, it&#x27;s the tale of a young girl returning home after surgery to find everything is weird and her mother is some sort of eerie mannequin. It might be my favourite horror game of 2021? Now&#x27;s a good time to raise Mothered because: 1) it finally has a demo for newcomers; 2) for veterans, that demo actually hides a secret expansion continuing the game&#x27;s story.

                              <span>Anime show Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is streaming on Netflix from today, more than two years after the big tudum and Cyberpunk 2077 developers CD Projekt announced they were working together. The show may have hit whatever the 21st century equivalent of airwaves is and become a tangible piece of media to consume now, but CD Projekt have confirmed in an earnings call that they’re still “fully committed” to continuing with the Cyberpunk IP. I can’t believe I just typed the term IP.

The game had struggled to make an impact since its launch on March 3rd earlier this year, with concurrent player counts dropping to zero at times. It hadn&#x27;t looked good from the early days when, as we pointed out, Platinum Games were tweeting statements that Babylon’s Fall’s wasn’t &quot;in danger&quot; just two weeks following its launch.

Dispel those mental images of theHunter: Call Of The Wild and Big Buck Hunter though, because it sounds like this is more in the vein of hack-and-slash monster hunting shenanigans.

Unlike the mere low-res images of abandoned Steam Deck designs we’ve already seen, however, these were mostly functional PC gaming machines. That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who shared a video of an early, more rounded-looking Deck booting to SteamOS and loading up Half-Life 2.

A succession of missed notes whizzing past sounds like an ode to my failure, and in mashups that mix demanding rhythms with another genre - like Crypt Of The Necrodancer, say - these reminders of my musical inadequacy often drown out even the simplest pleasures. 

Often but not always. Metal: Hellsinger&#x27;s mix of rhythm game and Doom 2016-style shooter kept me tapping my foot as I battled through hell - even as I failed regularly, and even as someone who doesn&#x27;t care for metal music.

                              <span>I did a lot of talking at Gamescom, whether that be to developers or muttering to myself deliriously as I typed stuff up in the evening. Talking to devs especially is a wonderful thing, especially when you&#x27;re playing their game and it resonates with you. But getting hands-on with an early portion of American Arcadia rendered me virtually silent, to the point where I had to apologise to the devs for being so quiet.
And I wasn&#x27;t being rude; far from it! I was just so engrossed in the game&#x27;s mixture of side-scrolling platforming and first-person puzzling. Keep this under surveillance, because I think it&#x27;s going to be a real hit when it lands.

                              <span>Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There&#x27;s currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. &quot;Let me in!!&quot; you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. &quot;I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!&quot;
If you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It&#x27;s a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There&#x27;s so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it&#x27;s so much fun that if you&#x27;d never played a stealth sim in your life I&#x27;d recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn&#x27;t, because it feels like I&#x27;d be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a very odd feeling, building a catapult all on your lonesome while watching fiery death rain down on your enemy&#x27;s castle in the valley below. I suspect it&#x27;s probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio&#x27;s first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player&#x27;s position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about.

                              <span>&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; is a phrase you hear a lot in Sunday Gold. It&#x27;s often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, &quot;You havin&#x27; a laugh, mate?&quot; and &quot;Facking hell!&quot; - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik&#x27; tha&#x27;, innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she&#x27;s often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you&#x27;re about to nail &#x27;em. 
It&#x27;s a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop&#x27;s style, Invisible Inc&#x27;s tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There&#x27;s still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven&#x27;t been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that&#x27;s saying something.

                              <span>Ubisoft’s subscription service doesn’t have the user-base of something like Microsoft’s Game Pass. Now, it seems, the French publishers are hoping that plonking in some indie games among its multitudes of Assassin’s Creeds and Tom Clancy shooters will attract a more varied clientele. They’re also running a free trial period for Ubisoft+ until October 10th, including for lapsed subscribers, so that’s something.

Squeenix have teamed with blockchain company Oasys, who describe themselves as “environmentally-friendly”. This is because of their less energy-intensive “proof-of-stake” mechanism compared to “proof-of-work” methods such as those used in Bitcoin mining. Oasys&#x27;s plans fits with Squeenix’s intention to develop tokenised economies built on blockchain in their future games.
