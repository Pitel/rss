Overwatch 2 was released on Switch and multiple other platforms just over a week ago, and it&#x27;s safe to say the launch has been a bit of a nightmare for Blizzard and the game&#x27;s community. The servers were apparently hit by &quot;mass DDoS attacks&quot; and there were lengthy queue times and connection issues.

                              <span>Unveiled at Nintendo Live 2022
Recently, Nintendo held a &quot;Nintendo Live 2022&quot; celebration in Tokyo, Japan, which included concerts for both Splatoon 3 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. But they also had a few other things on display, like this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom statue.
Link is donning his newer outfit, complete with a badass shonen cape, a bow, a sword, and a killer arm. The detail on the chain links of his armor and his gloves (and the belt!) are excellent: and the base he&#x27;s on gives off the aura of &quot;dilapidated stone,&quot; which fits the dire/ruin theme of the game we&#x27;ve seen thus far.
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (which we know is pronounced like &quot;tears of joy&quot;) is due out on May 12, 2023. It feels like it&#x27;s been a long time coming, and it kind of will be! Zelda: Breath of the Wild was released in March of 2017, so by then, it&#x27;ll be a whopping six years since it launched alongside of the Switch.
I literally can&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;ve talked about this often, but Breath of the Wild is still deeply relevant, and I have to constantly double and triple check to make sure I didn&#x27;t get the release date wrong.

A virtual reality version of a very popular impostor game hits headsets soon. Among Us VR arrives on November 10 for Steam and Meta Quest.
This version of Among Us is a collaboration between Schell Games, Innersloth, and Robot Teddy. The new version will run for $9.99, and you can find it on the Steam store here or over at the Quest storefront.
As you can tell from the trailers we&#x27;ve seen thus far, this is essentially first-person VR Among Us. Players take on the role of different crewmates, all trying to complete their tasks on the ship. Meanwhile, one or some of them are impostors, and their goal is take out the crew while not getting caught.

A brand-new perspective
Among Us VR will support four to ten players in a match. VR players can only play with other VR players, though. And it looks like the level included so far is called Skeld II, a 3D made-for-virtual-reality version of the Skeld from classic Among Us.
The old mini-games will return, as will some new ones just for VR. And of course, there&#x27;s the difference in perspective. While 2D Among Us takes an overhead view, Among Us VR goes fully first-person. Seeing someone vent in VR will probably be terrifying.

Alongside the news of Among Us VR&#x27;s release date, today&#x27;s Meta Connect showcase also held a few more big reveals. Meta has picked up several gaming studios, including Iron Man VR developer Camouflaj, Twisted Pixel, and Armature Studio, the team behind Resident Evil 4&#x27;s Meta Quest adaptation.
Meta also unveiled its new virtual reality headset, the Meta Quest Pro. It&#x27;s a high-end piece of hardware that comes with a hefty price tag. Among Us VR, meanwhile, can run on the Meta Quest 2 or on other headsets via Steam.

Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: With the controversy around the web regarding Sony possibly remaking/remastering Horizon Zero Dawn, I thought it&#x27;d be fun to do a roundtable discussion about what our favorite and actually necessary remakes/remasters have been throughout the years.

The game publisher had previously announced that their support services had been hacked and asked users not to open any links received from them via email. They&#x27;re now contacting users whose information was accessed and made available for sale by the hackers.

It will reportedly feature all four major golfing championships, as well as several of the world&#x27;s most famous courses. You can find the thirty seconds of footage of grass and sandpits below.

                              <span>I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee&#x27;s recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as &quot;extremely relevant to [my] interests&quot;. So relevant, in fact, that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this wasn&#x27;t an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn&#x27;t do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it&#x27;s immediately become my favourite thing I&#x27;ve ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I&#x27;ve been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice&#x27;s part. No idea if I&#x27;ve succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

                              <span>I was underwhelmed by Prime Day’s lack of compelling desktop RAM deals, and Amazon’s follow-up – the Prime Early Access Sale – is also pretty quiet for good memory discounts. However, there are some intriguing offers on DDR5 RAM, which is perfect timing: AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs have just launched, and unlike their Intel 13th Gen/Raptor Lake rivals, won’t be compatible with older DDR4 at all.

Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn&#x27;t have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent&#x27;s ball: that was just extraneous detail.

                              <span>Not keen on the snazzy driving effects in recently announced racer Need For Speed Unbound? That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

                              <span>Coral Island  self-describes as a &quot;reimagining of farming games&quot;, but if we&#x27;re being real it doesn&#x27;t reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that&#x27;s what we call ourselves).
That&#x27;s not to say Coral Island isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you&#x27;re doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe&#x27;s smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

                              <span>Capcom are making literal big bad Lady Dimitrescu a wee bit shorter for Resident Evil Village’s The Mercenaries Additional Orders DLC, out later this month. Game director Kento Kinoshita told Polygon that although playable Lady D is still taller than any other character in Mercenaries, she’s been shortened to “a little under nine feet tall” from her canon height of around nine feet six inches. Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

That includes loads on PC gaming hardware, though my eyes were most immediately caught by something not very desktop-grade at all. The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy &gt;50% savings in both the UK and US.

It&#x27;s a competitive PVE game where teams of heroes fight it out to finish a dungeon run the fastest. And having seen a brief presentation of it behind closed doors, it looks like a good time - albeit one taking heavy inspiration from its main competitors.

It’s interesting timing, considering Black Friday 2022 is next month, but this Amazon-only sale does provide some fresh opportunities to pick up some components, peripherals or gaming laptops at more agreeable prices. Therefore, I’ll be here across the two-day event – that’s October 11th and 12th – keeping track of all the best Prime Early Access deals on PC gaming hardware that I can find.

The latest attack came just after Overwatch 2 had finished a period of emergency maintenance. Although Blizzard have confirmed the DDoS attack has now ended, the recurring attacks aren’t exactly a good sign for a game already beset by technical issues.

One of the most significant and recognizable changes in my gaming habits over the past 30 years has been my slow retreat from the fighting game genre. Mind you, I was never really into the FGC, having participated in one entire tournament in my life when I was very young. But like many of those who came of age during the original console wars, Street Fighter II and its various iterations integrated itself into my life, my leisure time, and my many playground conversations with friends. We shared strategies, talked up our favorite characters (Cammy here), and convinced each other that the lies of secret characters we heard from the older kids were totally true but we just weren’t skilled enough to access them.

                              <span>Not as tantalizing as IHOP: Road Trip
I’ve been to Hooters at some point during my teen years. I can tell you that all the hormones in the world would not take away from how awkward I felt. I’d say it was mutual shame, like getting your genitals waxed, but I don’t know who would take that job not feeling comfortable with the implications. So, the shame was all me. It’s like going to a strip club; I understand the purpose, but I’m still afraid to make eye contact. At the very least, I respect a place that moves ogling out of parks and beaches and into a consensual environment, but I have damage in the ogling center of my brain.
Believe it or not, Hooters actually had a video game. Sort of like how McDonald’s had McDonald’s Treasure Land Adventure, except instead of mascots, there are tits. …</span>

                              <span>More story content is also on the way for Saints Row
The team at Volition is laying out the future of updates for Saints Row. As the reboot passes a significant milestone, the developer is also talking about its plans for fine-tuning the game post-launch.
In a new blog, Volition and publisher Deep Silver confirm the 2022 Saints Row has seen 1 million players boot it up. That&#x27;s a lot of players, but Saints Row has also been dealing with a number of bugs, too.
The studio says it is prioritizing delivering improvements over new features. Part of that is the major update planned for late November, the first one Saints Row is receiving since its launch in August.
The update will see &#x27;over 200&#x27; bug fixes and stability upgrades. There will be a focus on challenges, overall stability.
&quot;We’re especially aware of issues some players have been having with co-op and we’re sorry these fixes have taken longer than expected while we apply and test them thoroughly,&quot; said Volition in the update.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YgjzDJA1o1E
What&#x27;s in store the reboot
Quality-of-life improvements are also in store for the autumn update. A few specified changes include reducing repetition in some activities, improving management of vehicles, and making challenges more rewarding.
Though newer content is &quot;less of a priority&quot; for the Saints Row team now, the crew is still planning for the future. Volition and Deep Silver say they plan to support Saints Row for the long-term.
Saints Row is due to receive all-new story content in 2023, included in the Expansion Pass or purchasable as a separate piece. Free ne gameplay experiences and city areas are also in development. Cosmetic DLC is also expected to arrive this week for all Saints Row owners, with more on the way this year. Expansion Pass owners will get a few additional cosmetic packs, too.

                              <span>You can take screenshots in the Switch Online menu now
Nintendo has released a Switch 15.0.0 firmware update, and although it&#x27;s mostly stability related, like some updates in the past, a few small things have changed.
The most obvious alteration is the following: &quot;Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application found on the Nintendo Switch HOME Menu.&quot; In short, this will now allow users to screencap the Switch Online menus: where you can view various My Nintendo challenges, bits of news, special offers, and expansion pack info.
One of the main bonuses of this change is the ability to easily take photos of the cycling array of Switch profile icons, which currently include Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing. At the moment you cannot take screenshots of several other menus in the Nintendo Switch OS, including the eShop.
The other even smaller change involves moving the Bluetooth audio menu (where you can connect various accessories, including headphones). It&#x27;s not very exciting for a firmware update, right?! Well, that&#x27;s par for the course.
Switch 15.0.0 firmware patch notes (Released October 10, 2022):
The location of the Bluetooth Audio menu within System Settings has moved.
Screenshots can be taken using the Capture Button while in the Nintendo Switch Online application
General system stability improvements to enhance the user&#x27;s experience

                              <span>But you should probably go to bed
Atlus&#x27; celebrated JRPG Persona 5 Royal is getting set to head to tabletops everywhere, in the form of a brand new card game adaptation that is currently in the works at Pandasauras Games. Designed by veteran designer Emerson Matsuuchi, the new game hopes to capture the surreal adventure and excitement of the 2019 smash hit.
Details are slim-to-none on the rules and setup of the Persona 5 Royal card game but, according to Matsuuchi, games will see players will team up as members of The Phantom Thieves before embarking upon quests to steal hearts, defeat demons, and redeem a rogues&#x27; gallery of bad dudes and dudettes. The world and characters of Persona 5 will all be putting in an appearance, from Joker, Lady Ann, and Morgana, to the Palaces, The Metaverse, and the luxurious but unnerving Velvet Room.

The Persona series has always been a fine fit for tabletop adaptation, what with its compendium of monsters and demons, multiple protagonists and antagonists, dungeon-crawling nature, and, of course, its sexy and immediately recognizable visual style. The franchise has seen a number of official and unofficial adaptations already, in the form of the Japanese card game Persona VS, and the very cool Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game.
Persona 5 Royal will launch in the fall of 2023. In related news, Atlus announced this weekend that series classics Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will finally launch on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms in January 2023. You can read more about these releases right here.

The next Pokemon generation is just around the corner, and there&#x27;s still some more info to share on what&#x27;s in store. The Pokemon Company confirms that more info on Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will air on its YouTube channel this week.
A new drop will happen on October 12, tomorrow, at 6 a.m. PT. The video will go live on the official Pokemon YouTube channel then.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1579819355851743233
There isn&#x27;t any indication about how long this particular video will be, or what content it will cover.
Exploring Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s new region
We&#x27;ve had a number of these info drops pop up over the last few weeks. On October 6, a new trailer dove into the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, showing some battle footage and the Terrastallize mechanic in practice.
The auto-battle function that&#x27;s been teased was also shown off. This option lets Pokemon run off and fight their own battles, separate from the trainer. It can be used to pick up items too, and it seems like one of this generation&#x27;s three main story pillars will involve storming a Team Star hideout alongside your Pokemon.
A quiet surprise was the TM Machine, which will let players create TMs using items dropped by Pokemon. This could be a big one for endgame Pokemon raising and training, as well as helping players adapt to the gyms.

Alongside news like that, we&#x27;ve also seen info about some of the new Pokemon and regional variants. New faces like Wigglett and Lechonk are already stealing hearts, or terrifying them in the former&#x27;s case.
All this, alongside legendary mounts that can help you can get around Paldea, sure makes Pokemon Scarlet and Violet look like interesting entries in the mainline Pokemon series. We&#x27;ll see what more the Pokemon team has in store to show off tomorrow.

                              <span>It&#x27;s all Greek to me
The studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal has now rebranded as &quot;Onoma&quot; — The name change comes following the outfit&#x27;s acquisition by Swedish holding company Embracer Group.
In a statement on the studio&#x27;s sparkling fresh website, Onoma reveals that it went through over 160 name suggestions before settling on the new name, which is Greek for &quot;name&quot; and was chosen due to its easy pronunciation in almost any language — most notably French and English, the native languages of the French-Canadian studio.
&quot;Our strength has always been our ability to evolve and adapt to trends and market changes,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;Our rebrand as Studio Onoma is one more transformation that we are excited to take on. Our new brand identity will serve as an umbrella to multiple products, programs, and initiatives, each with distinct personalities.&quot;
Onoma was acquired from Square Enix by Embracer Group back in May of this year, in a smart and lucrative deal that also included proven developers Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, as well as a catalog of well-known and successful IPs including Legacy of Kain, Thief, Deus Ex, and, most notably, Tomb Raider. The $300 million (USD) acquisition was finally completed in August.
&quot;Our name and look might have changed,&quot; concludes the developer&#x27;s statement, &quot;but we are still us: a studio that empowers creativity and innovation and always puts people before products. (Just in a new and improved version!)&quot;

Although the quality of the Fallout series has waxed and waned over the years, the name still means something. The original series was a trailblazer in the genre, and there&#x27;s still a lot of goodwill left from modern adaptations like Fallout: New Vegas. To remind people of how important this series is, Bethesda is running a new Fallout retrospective series, which you can watch for free on YouTube.
The first clip, &quot;conceiving Fallout,&quot; has a few familiar faces, including folks from Black Isle Studios. Original producer Tim Cain, executive producer Brian Fargo, and original artist/designer Leonard Boyarsky are present for this first episode, in addition to Feargus Urquhart (division director at Black Isle).

                              <span>Hot Spartan Summer... Fall
Sensational rap artist Megan Thee Stallion seems to be on a one-woman mission to twerk her way to pop culture infamy — Not content with getting all the knuckle-draggers angry via her recent appearance on Marvel&#x27;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the Texan lyric spitter is now cutting a rug with, of all the people, Halo&#x27;s legendary spartan warrior, Master Chief.
The bizarre but energizing confrontation took place at TwitchCon this past weekend, where Ms. Thee Stallion was performing an on-stage set for a rabid crowd of fans and attendees. It was a typical flashy and energetic appearance from the artist, but things took a turn for both the bizarre and the fantastic when Megan was joined by the Halo protagonist, who promptly bust out some fuckin&#x27; moves in full Spartan arm…</span>

                              <span>At least we&#x27;re getting a compilation next year
While any given year for Mega Man can be a dire situation, there&#x27;s at least something on the horizon for the 35th anniversary: the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection in 2023. Of course, the Mega Man 35th anniversary celebration is mostly centered around merch for now.
As reported by Rockman Corner, the &quot;first collaboration&quot; for the 35th anniversary of the Blue Bomber is...an expensive t-shirt line. In a partnership with Japanese company Avirex, Capcom is putting out Mega Man t-shirts, which will run you about 45 USD (as Rockman Corner points out, there&#x27;s international shipping).
The main bit of news here (because there is always an endless supply of Mega Man merch) is the logo reveal, which came by way of the Avirex store. It&#x27;s a stark contrast to the other logos (gathered by Rockman Corner), dating all the way back to the old school 10th anniversary. For four straight anniversaries (10th, 15th, 20th, 25th) we have a clear view of Mega Man&#x27;s face (in various incarnations). Then for the 30th anniversary, Capcom opted for a cool minimalist design that lined up with the release of the Mega Man 30th Anniversary Bundle.
But the 35th logo is simply text, an off-putting giant &quot;35th&quot; numerical value, and a Capcom copyright. Mega Man fans know better than to expect anything from any given anniversary, but hopefully there&#x27;s something in the cards for this milestone.

                              <span>But don&#x27;t you be playing no emulators, ya hear?
Valve has announced that its powerful and alluring handheld console, Steam Deck, is now &quot;readily available&quot; for purchase — The portable PC had previously been a pre-order-only product, but the publisher now believes that it is comfortably in place to receive and deliver upon all customer orders.
Originally announced back in July 21, with pre-orders opening not long thereafter, Valve has been steadily manufacturing and delivering Steam Deck hardware to its customers in batches — impacted production delays and component shortages brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Valve, true to its word, was able to rapidly increase its output since spring of this year, and has seen to delivering upon all of the initial pre-orders. Manufacturing woes have continued to stifle hardware production for all major industries over the past three years.

Despite the Steam Deck&#x27;s relative availability, Valve has warned that production on the expensive piece of tech may slow once again should the company be inundated with orders. It seems that, for the most part, anybody who has been waiting on the opportunity to bag themselves a handheld PC can now do so over on the official website. In addition, the company is now taking pre-orders in Asian territories including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
In other related news, a weekend hotfix saw the Steam Deck handle Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 beta with what appears to be relative ease, Valve also took down several online videos over the weekend that showed the console running naughty emulators. Now Homer, Don&#x27;t You Eat This Pie.

                              <span>Fan Fest was a blast, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back
In-person Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festivals were on hold, but Square Enix has triumphantly announced that they&#x27;re back on as of 2023.
By way of a new YouTube video, the publisher is ready to bring back the convention series to in-person events, starting with a kickoff in Las Vegas, Nevada (a prior Fan Fest site in the US) in July of 2023. Several months later the team will move to London in October of that same year, followed by a concluding Fan Fest in &quot;early 2024&quot; in Japan.
For those of you who aren&#x27;t aware of Fan Fest, it&#x27;s a two-day celebration of Final Fantasy XIV, complete with merch to buy, hands-on events and challenges (some of which are unique to the convention), meet and greets, and even full-on concerts and performances. Typically, we also get content teases and reveals, including new jobs and features of upcoming updates and whatever future expansion is in store at the time.
If you&#x27;re remotely a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I highly recommend attending. Given the cooperative nature of the game itself, and the positive reputation of the fanbase, it&#x27;s a great way to meet people or just enjoy the game on your own.
You can find the full landing page for Fan Fest here.
Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023-2024 dates:
Las Vegas, Nevada: July 28-29, 2023 (Las Vegas Convention Center)
London, UK: October 21-22, 2023 (ExCeL London)
Japan: Early 2024 (no venue selected yet)

As if the chaotic, madcap world of MultiVersus wasn&#x27;t already total mania, things are getting set to go completely off the deep end this week, with the arrival of the malevolent, dangerous, and utterly unpredictable Stripe, the chief antagonist of Joe Dante&#x27;s 1984 horror-comedy, Gremlins.
As the alpha male of cutie-pie Gizmo&#x27;s villainous brethren, Stripe quickly establishes his dominance as the self-styled &quot;leader&quot; of the mischievous/homicidal batch of Mogwai — rendered vile due to the breaking of the golden &quot;Never feed them after midnight&quot; rule. Following a terrifying rampage across the sleepy town of Kingston Falls, Stripe&#x27;s arrogance finally oversteps his cunning, and he eventually finds himself bursting into an explosion of goo, hit with the harmful rays of the dawn&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>The &quot;winter&quot; window has been narrowed down
Several months ago, Nintendo teased a trio of Splatoon 3 amiibo (Octoling Blue, Inkling Yellow, and Smallfry) arriving &quot;this holiday.&quot; Well thanks to a new YouTube video, the release date has been narrowed down to November 11.
Roughly the first minute of the video is a recap of everything we covered here: including basic amiibo functionality. But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there&#x27;s a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old Splatoon amiibo (including Pearl and Marina) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.
Keep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven&#x27;t been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.
Once these three are released in November, we&#x27;ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora (still needs full confirmation)
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

Streaming site Twitch and PC merch manufacturer Lenovo came under fire this weekend, following a series of serious and devastating injuries that occurred at the former&#x27;s live event TwitchCon 2022 — The separately occurring accidents all took place at Lenovo&#x27;s &quot;foam pit&quot;, where attendees were taking part in pugilistic combat similar to that of &#x27;90s TV game show Gladiators.
The battles, which were live streamed by Lenovo and other con attendees, saw players fight it out on small raised podiums placed above a &quot;foam pit&quot; — ostensibly a large area filled with foam cubes to prevent the loser from injuring themselves when falling from said podiums. However, it appears that the pit was much shallower than it appeared, with no dismount assistance, whic…</span>

                              <span>Anyone for BBQ?
In a move completely befitting the new adventure&#x27;s confusing tone, Sega has announced that it is partnering with Capcom to bring a glut of Monster Hunter-themed DLC to its incoming release Sonic Frontiers. The free crossover DLC drop will launch on November 15, shortly after the title&#x27;s launch.
The Monster Hunter content drop will include two forms of Rathalos armor, one fully encasing The Blue Blur while a variant frees up his lower body and iconic sneakers. In addition, the tried-and-tested culture of barbecuing will also be coming to Sonic&#x27;s world, in the form of a BBQ minigame and a roasted spit prop — Though I doubt very much that our boy will be doing much slaughtering in Sonic Frontiers.

Crossovers are always cool and free DLC always welcome, but these titles sure make for strange bedfellows. Frankly, Sonic looks bizarre fully encased in Rathalos armor. But, as I noted at the top of the article, this strange partnership is perfectly befitting of a video game that itself is muddled in tone, being at once somber and ethereal while retaining the ring-grabbing, loop-de-loop action of the colorful and beloved 16-bit platforming series.
I fully expect Sega to announce a Sonic Frontiers x Rainbow Six Siege crossover within the year.
Sonic Frontiers launches November 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

This weekend saw a lucky cabal of World Warriors throw down in the first beta testing session for Capcom&#x27;s upcoming release Street Fighter 6. And it goes without saying that the new sequel was welcomed with open arms, with both pro and amateur players showering the title with praise across social media, already rolling out screenshots, clips, combo videos, and obvious memes.
I, myself, was fortunate enough to be part of the punch party. This represented my third time playing SF6, but the first time I had the sequel &quot;on tap&quot;, so to speak. If I wasn&#x27;t feeling optimistic about the title before (I was), then the beta really solidified for me that Capcom is making something very special here. All the studio need do is stay the course. Don&#x27;t add dopey NFTs, don&#x27;t over…</span>

                              <span>After a very rough launch week, Overwatch 2 seems to be finally finding its legs. Big issues such as server stability, SMS authentication, and automatic skin purchases have been improved, fixed, or are in the process of getting adjusted. However, there are still tons of individual issues with Overwatch 2 characters…

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

Everybody up for yet another Soulslike? Yeah, we thought as much. However, Black Mermaid&#x27;s Moonscars has been turning heads since it was first announced due to its rather exquisitely detailed pixel art style. This is a deliciously dark 2D slasher with Metroidvania elements that reminds us a little of Motion Twin&#x27;s dazzling Dead Cells, albeit with much starker environments housing its meticulously animated combat. But how does all of this lovely-looking murder actually play?
Well, it&#x27;s a bit of a banger all things told, an attractive marriage of excellent presentation and punchy combat. However, there are some pretty persistent frame rate issues present in this Switch port that have put the brakes on us scoring it exactly as we&#x27;d have liked to. Let&#x27;s keep our collective fingers crossed that Black Mermaid can get this stuff patched up ASAP because, if these problems can be ironed out, you&#x27;re looking at a super slick and stylish action game that looks fantastic and has some very clever gameplay wrinkles tucked up its blood-soaked sleeves.

                              <span>Not a Mystic Quest, but a Series Quest.
One of the biggest surprises of September&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was Square Enix&#x27;s Theatrhythm series&#x27; return to consoles! Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is coming to Switch on 16th February 2023, and the company has now shared several gameplay details on its blog, while also unveiling a brand new mode for the game — Series Quests.
Series Quests are the best way to unlock songs and playable characters in the game and, as the name suggests, they&#x27;ll have you play through songs from multiple games in the Final Fantasy series and &quot;past titles&quot;. There are 29 different titles to play through, and you&#x27;ll need to complete a number of quests.

RedDeer.Games has been the development studio behind a whole host of titles on Switch from League of Enthusiastic Losers to Little Bug, but their latest puzzler, Reky, looks to be their simplest game yet (well, discounting AAA Clock and all associated titles, that is). The studio has announced that the game will be coming to the Switch eShop on October 14th - but a few short days away.
Getting from point A to B may not initially appear to be the most enticing of concepts, though Reky has this challenge as its central, and only, mission. Check out the above trailer and you&#x27;re sure to get an idea of what we mean.

Cute, colourful, pixel art platformer? Check. SNES-inspirations? Check. Bopping music? Check check and check! Pompom: The Great Space Rescue is looking to bring some lovely platforming SNES nostalgia to your Switch on 25th October (thanks, Gematsu!). Developed by Tomo Camp, the game sees an adorable little hamster take to space to save his friend from a team of Space Cat Pirates!
The inspiration thread is clear — from Super Mario World to Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 3 to Mega Man X, plenty of level designs, layouts, and puzzles all look back to the past. But this ham has his own little twist — you&#x27;re not moving Pompom, you&#x27;re moving the platforms.

                              <span>A.K.A, the world&#x27;s toughest choice.
One of the most important aspects of any game, in this writer&#x27;s opinion, is the music. We&#x27;ve all been there: you might be stepping onto a new island in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker or floating through &#x27;Space Junk Galaxy&#x27; in Super Mario Galaxy when a new music score plays in the background and completely stops you in your tracks.
An exceptional music track can stick with you for years; it anchors us to our past, reminds us of simpler times, and — perhaps more than anything — gives us a remarkable feeling of attachment to certain video games or franchises. Can you imagine walking around Pokémon Red and Blue&#x27;s Pallet Town without that iconic soothing theme tune in the background? What about &#x27;Jungle Hijinxs&#x27; from Donkey Kong Country? Why, that level would be infinitely less memorably without that head-bobbing rhythmic beat!

To cement Splatoon 3&#x27;s remarkable success in Japan after its launch on September 9th, it&#x27;s been confirmed that the title sold 2.7 million boxed copies last month, making up nearly 70% of all physical games in the country.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Splatoon 3 topped the top ten charts for the month of September, speeding ahead of the competition for a more-than-comfortable lead. It even outsold the combined sales of Dragon Quest X: Rise of the Five Tribes Offline on Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, all of which entered the top ten.

A Japanese VTuber streaming group has issued an apology after its members projected adult content into online Splatoon 3 matches.
The stream in question was held on October 8th by the streaming group &#x27;Sinsogumi&#x27;, subsequently causing “AVスプラ” (adult video Splatoon)&#x27; to trend on Twitter in Japan. The content itself was inserted into online matches by utlilising chroma key to effectively make the opposing team&#x27;s ink colour a canvas for displaying naughty content in the background.

Aionios has been a bit quiet lately, hasn&#x27;t it? Unless you&#x27;re still ploughing through this monolithic RPG, of course. But we&#x27;re just days away from Wave 2 of Xenoblade Chronicle 3&#x27;s DLC landing, and the official Japanese Twitter account has today woken up with a little update, and the reveal of the brand new character.
If you played through Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and its DLC, you might recognise this little fellow — the Nopon Archsage. He was in charge of the Challenge Battles, and here, he&#x27;s reprising his role in Xenoblade Chronicles 3. How can a cute little guy like this be looking after one of the game&#x27;s most-difficult elements?

                              <span>Everything could be awesome.
Though the late &#x27;90s and early &#x27;00s saw a variety of Lego video games released across all genres, the launch of LEGO Star Wars kicked off a 30+ game run of co-op action platformers based around myriad popular IP that’s still going strong today. It’s a formula that’s worked well and evolved somewhat over the years, but it’s tough to deny that the gameplay hasn’t gotten a bit stale with time. Luckily, Lego (the company) has lately been experimenting more in breaking away from this tired formula with smaller titles like LEGO Builder&#x27;s Journey that are more creative in scope. The latest of these is LEGO Bricktales, a puzzle-focused, slower-paced release that demands more of the player’s creativity and problem-solving skills. It’s a little rough around the edges, but the gameplay is solid and definitely worth checking out.
Lego Bricktales places you in the role of a minifig visiting your eccentric inventor grandpa, who has finally managed to successfully build a portal that can take you to other worlds. Unfortunately, he was so preoccupied with his work that he forgot to clean up the messy amusement park where his lab is based, and his landlord has promised she’ll seize the land if it isn’t cleaned up by the end of the day. Luckily for him, a helpful little robot named Rusty comes in to save the day and builds a machine to clean up the park in time. The catch is that the machine needs power, and it runs on happiness crystals which are sourced from grateful people. To help out gramps, you thus volunteer to use his portal to travel around with Rusty and help people, hopefully collecting enough crystals before he loses the park.

Bravely Default celebrates its 10th Anniversary today, having launched in Japan back on October 11th, 2012 under the title Bravely Default: Flying Fairy.
To celebrate, Nintendo has slashed the price of Bravely Default II on the UK Switch eShop, taking it down from the standard £49.99 to a much more palatable £24.99. The offer is live now and will continue until October 20th, so you&#x27;ve a little over a week to take advantage of this pretty generous deal. Should the offer be replicated in North America, we&#x27;ll update this post to let you know.

Everyone&#x27;s got their favourite items when it comes to the Mario Kart franchise, but we&#x27;d be willing to bet that it probably isn&#x27;t the Blue Shell.
Introduced in Mario Kart 64 and subsequently becoming a mainstay in the franchise to this very day, the Blue Shell is a veritable nightmare for those cruising along in first place, particularly if you&#x27;ve got nothing at your disposable to mitigate the impact.

                              <span>Where&#x27;s the official port, huh?
When Genshin Impact was first released back in 2020, you would be forgiven for thinking that it would be a dead cert that the open-world RPG (*cough* Breath of the Wild clone *cough*) would be making its way to Switch at some point in the future. You would be right, it will come to Switch at some point in the future... probably.
Tired of waiting for updates, one fan on Reddit has taken the porting process into their own hands and has managed to get a version of the game up and just about running on the Nintendo console. In the video (thanks, GameRant) you can see u/wingsofthygiant managing to load up the title on Switch and, after a pretty meaty loading time, even run around a little.

This article was originally published as an in-progress review without a score prior to the arrival of the 4.0 Waypoint update, which brought a raft of new features in the days after launch. It has now been updated with our impressions of Waypoint and awarded an overall score.

It&#x27;s been a long old road for Hello Games&#x27; No Man&#x27;s Sky. First revealed at the VGX Awards all the way back in 2013, the procedurally generated infinite space simulator finally released — riding an enormous wave of hype — in August of 2016. However, the PS4 and PC game we got our sweaty hands on was a far cry from what had been advertised and promised during a build-up to launch that could have made Peter Molyneux blush.

Tou první podpora plného šifrování virtuálních strojů, tou druhou nová grafická vrstva pro Direct3D 11, která pro běh na Linuxu využívá překladovou vrstvu DXVK a rozhraní Vulkan.</span>

                              <span>Cílem vývojářů Blenderu je, aby příští verze 3.4 už na Linuxu podporovala nativní běh na Waylandu. Práce na tomto cíli zdárně pokračují, ač zatím přetrvávají nedostatky, například v podpoře HiDPI, tabletů, 3D myši atd. Nejnovější denní sestavení již mají podporu Waylandu aktivovanou, takže je možné si vše osobně vyzkoušet.</span>

Hayashi kicked things off with a pre-recorded message, and specifically brought up the Toukiden series up (which had releases in 2013 and 2016) as part of Koei Tecmo&#x27;s history with the genre: and noted that the company had &quot;unfinished business&quot; with hunting games.

                              <span>In each issue, Game Informer prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We&#x27;d like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.
You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

By default though, your options for connecting the controller are Bluetooth (on later models) or a wired USB connection - rather than the low-latency 2.4GHz wireless you get on Xbox consoles, which requires Microsoft&#x27;s $25 Wireless Adapter for Windows. That adapter is down to $18 at Newegg today, and is well worth picking up while it&#x27;s discounted.

Hello, friends of me, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing?

                              <span>One of the things you can do with a Steam Deck is use it for emulation. Someone at Valve is evidently aware of this, given the recent Steam Deck video - which we wrote about two days ago - contained a shot of a Steam library with a Nintendo Switch emulator in it.

Oops. Valve have since deleted and re-uploaded the video with the emulator removed.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to take backwards compatibility for granted on PC, so much so that we rarely even use the phrase &quot;backwards compatibility&quot;. Most old games will simply run, and for everything else there&#x27;s usually a compatibility mode built into Windows or DOSBox to get it going.

This didn&#x27;t happen by accident, as an old blog post by a former Microsoft programmer explains. When Microsoft wanted users to switch to Windows 95, for example, they went so far as to add specific code that looked for SimCity and, if it was running, changed how memory allocation worked so that the game wouldn&#x27;t crash.

                              <span>Graphics cards are getting bigger, hotter and more expensive - and that first one is more of a problem than you might think. With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. 
The best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers.

This GP66 Leopard is one of the fastest gaming laptops on the market, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD and a 144Hz screen - not to mention that flagship-grade graphics card. 
It normally retails for a cool £1998, but today Laptops Direct has discounted it to £1399.97, making it the cheapest RTX 3080 laptop we can find right now.

My imagination is a powerful thing. For example, I can conceive of several erotic situations involving Transformers. I can pretend, against incontrovertible evidence, that I am able to function in human society. However, a standard child’s imagination is magnitudes more powerful than my own. A child can believe that a dollar store knock-off Transformer is anywhere near as sexy as the real thing. They can also convince themselves that Mega Man on DOS is equatable to the NES version.

With too many games announced years before they&#x27;ll ever see the light of day on store shelves, I really get a kick out of those titles that go from reveal to release in just a couple of months. I don&#x27;t like to wait for all that much, so it&#x27;s great when there is a fast turnaround. Like with Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher for Nintendo Switch. Bandai Namco announced its localization just a few months ago. And yesterday, we learned the full release of the game is only days away.
Ultra Kaiju Monster Ranch for Switch will release on October 20. That is one day before my vacation to the Grand Canyon is set to begin, and I think this will be an excellent game to have along for the ride.

If you&#x27;ve been missing out on what this game is, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher takes the classic Monster Rancher franchise and smashes it up with the Ultraman tokusatsu series. Players will raise kaiju, train them, feed them cookies, have them do battle, and fuse them to create more powerful monsters. It&#x27;s all pretty ridiculous and I can&#x27;t wait to see it for myself on October 20.
Also, I want to thank the members of our community who, in my last post about the game, gave me recommendations for Ultraman X shows to watch to ready myself for this release. It&#x27;s been a lot of fun catching up with this franchise on my lunch breaks.

January 2023 just got slightly busier. This morning, Atlus dropped word that its ports of Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will land on Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on January 19. That&#x27;s just a little over three months away, fitting in nicely between the release of One Piece Odyssey on January 13 and Fire Emblem Engage on January 20. I know a few of my friends who&#x27;ve been waiting for a Persona 4 Switch release date will be very excited by this. Unfortunately, lest there be a surprise Limited Run Games or Strictly Limited announcement on the horizon, both titles will be digital only.
https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1578696035932815360
Persona 3 Portable was originally released for the PSP back in 2009 as the third version of the game, following Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES, both for the PlayStation 2. Persona 4 Golden is the best-selling PlayStation Vita title that also became a pretty big hit when it was released on Steam in 2020.
As a reminder, Persona 5 Royal releases on October 21 for Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you own the game on PS4 as I do, there will be no free update to the PS5 version.

                              <span>The Silver Hawk takes flight
Following a string of relative obscurities, this week&#x27;s Arcade Archives entry is no stranger to any coin-op fan worth their weight in pocket-jingling quarters — Taito&#x27;s legendary shmup, Darius, is now available to download on Nintendo Switch via the eShop.
Released to arcades in 1987, before making its way to a slew of home platforms, Darius is one of the most recognizable and beloved franchises in the shmup genre, rendered iconic thanks to its dazzling visuals, exciting two-player action, typically great Taito soundtrack, and, famously, its enormous arcade cabinet, which sported a huge, three-screen panoramic display. Darius puts players in the cockpit of the mighty Silver Hawk space vessels, tasked with defending the titular planet from the Belsar Empire.

The incredible success of these arcade and home ports would see the franchise stamp its identity as one of the all-time shmup classics. Taito would release a sequel, Darius II, in 1989, and a remixed version of the original game, Darius Plus, in 1990. Since these halcyon days, the franchise has been visited multiple times in the form of various remasters, sequels, and spin-offs. The most recent iteration, Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours, is available now on PS4 and PC. It is also worth noting that Darius, along with several follow-up releases, is also available via the two Darius Cozmic Collections.
Darius is available to download now on Nintendo Switch, priced at $8. It is already available on PS4.

                              <span>You were expecting somebody else?
Kojima Productions has revealed the identity of the movie star previously teased to appear in the studio&#x27;s newest mysterious project — Elle Fanning, of The Neon Demon and Maleficent fame, will be taking her first steps into Hideo Kojima&#x27;s strange and esoteric universe in the as-yet-unnamed release.
Admittedly, this will not come as much of a shock to anybody, as the initial teaser, which features an extreme close-up of Fanning&#x27;s head with the features in shadow, was quickly identified as the young starlet, thanks to her distinct ear shape and jawline. Kojima Productions as QR codes posted at PAX Australia were found to link to a new, uncensored version of the same headshot, with some variants replacing the phrase &quot;Who Am I?&quot; with a new question: &quot;Where Am I?&quot;

Fanning will join a list of notable Tinseltown actors who have worked with Kojima Productions on its releases. Most notably, 2019&#x27;s Death Stranding, which featured appearances from Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelson, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsey Wagner, among others. There was also a role for film director Nicholas Winding Refn, who coincidentally directed Fanning in the aforementioned psych-horror film, The Neon Demon.
It is very likely that we will hear more about Kojima Productions&#x27; new project and the involvement of Elle Fanning at The Game Awards, which is scheduled to take place December 8 at the Microsoft Arena in Los Angeles. I wouldn&#x27;t start the hype engines just yet, however. Given that this is yer boy Hideo that we&#x27;re talking about, there is likely to be something of a long haul ahead before the new title is even likely to be viewed in a playable state.

The group shut down the popular movie streaming site Ymovies.to through a suspect in Columbia. Around the same time, a Brazil-based pirate video CDN was pulled offline, blacking out dozens of other sites in the process.

According to the game developer, these allegations are patently false and not properly pleaded either. Bungie asks the court to dismiss all counterclaims, arguing that the cheaters throw around untrue claims to see if they stick.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

                              <span>More than six years after its original release, No Man&#x27;s Sky is finally out on Switch today alongside the new Waypoint update, which brings the game up to a new 4.0 version. This update is live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC as of today. 
As for what to expect, Waypoint is best described as a major overhaul to No Man&#x27;s Sky geared toward making the game easily tailored to players, regardless of the experience they&#x27;re trying to get out of it. If you want something more relaxing and casual, you can do that. If you want a more challenging experience, the Waypoint update lets you do that too. 
&quot;Access the universe of No Man&#x27;s Sky from anywhere in update 4.0 Waypoint, launching for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and overhauling fundamental elements of gameplay including game modes, inventory size, and usability, milestones, journey cataloging, and much more,&quot; the No Man&#x27;s Sky Waypoint blog post reads. &quot;Tailor every aspect of the game to your unique playstyle with custom game modes. Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience.&quot; 
Alongside today&#x27;s Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man&#x27;s Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more. Be sure to read the entire Waypoint blog post for all the details.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

                              <span>The new guards of Batman&#x27;s city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21.

This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

                              <span>I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium&#x27;s PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it&#x27;s not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn&#x27;t wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I&#x27;m 100% down for that.

                              <span>It feels odd saying &quot;Overwatch 1&quot;, but Overwatch 1 occupies an important place in my personal and professional life. And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game&#x27;s tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.
Clearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I&#x27;d grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I&#x27;d eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch&#x27;s intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2&#x27;s release, it all feels like it&#x27;s come full circle.

                              <span>Archtower is a roguelike and therefore bad, but... hnnnnnnngggh I like it. I might even come to love it, considering it&#x27;s already so enjoyable even with a few years of early access left (a fact I forgot until I reached a &quot;work in progress&quot; marker several hours in).
You climb a tower and splat monsters and culty magic nerds. You loot, and avoid traps, chug red liquids, and occasionally die and have to start again. But I enjoyed every moment, and never once hit the usual aggravating points that push me out of the genre. It&#x27;s good stuff all round, frankly.

                              <span>A new experience: Weird RPG is the first video game to make my lips numb. My character in the action-RPG is wearing magic tousers, see, which launch explosive basketball hoops every time I make noise into my microphone. Turns out, the most DPS-efficient noise is continually blowing to trill my lips like a child pretending to be a car. Weird RPG does have some fun ideas but sadly, it&#x27;s too mundane an ARPG to be truly weird—or good. Still, I was delighted when I found a helmet whose stats get better the worse your graphics card is.

                              <span>Scrolling through Twitter, Daniel Griffiths&#x27; interest was piqued when he saw a post describing a mysterious phenomenon being shared in the Nier: Automata community: A2 opening a hidden door in The Copied City and strolling into a secret, never-before-seen area. Curious, he decided to pursue more knowledge, and landed in the Nier modding Discord server. 


Like him, many other Nier: Automata players who caught wind of the phenomenon sat upright - metaphorically and perhaps literally - and flocked to both Reddit and Discord to check out what exactly was up with the secret area. It was dubbed the &quot;church mystery&quot; or &quot;sadfutago&#x27;s posts&quot;, among other monikers.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an increasingly ancient beast, gnarled and twisted over the past decade-and-a-bit by many, many mods that sometimes conflict with one another. That’s why Tyler Hallada put together Modmapper, a free tool released earlier this year that shows which of the mods hosted at NexusMods affect which areas of Skyrim. Now, Hallada’s written about the experience of creating the tool in a blog post, and the reasons for taking on the project.

That one! The one with the robots and the Soviet Alien dot detector thing!&quot; The most recent trailer for The Invincible arrived during this year&#x27;s E3 madness, and featured astrobiologist Yasna having a suspenseful encounter with a big spider bot and its anti-matter death ray. It was only a five-minute long clip at the time, but I&#x27;ve now played an expanded version of that particular scene, and yep, I still don&#x27;t much like the look of that there laser bot.

Key to this are custom game modes, auto-saves, dynamic difficulty, and inventory streamlining. There’s also a new relaxed mode for the particularly chilled among us. Watch the update trailer below for a rundown, and some trippy space visuals.

                              <span>Electronic Arts have formally launched their new store client doodad after a long open beta, replacing the much-maligned Origin with something they refer to as &quot;the EA app&quot; (its actual name is only &quot;EA&quot;). They say it&#x27;s faster and better. I think maybe it is? But it doesn&#x27;t really matter, as long as it&#x27;s not a disaster, because it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re using it unless you have to anyway. Just like Origin before it, the new EA app is an inconvenience you must accept to play the EA games which require it, and beyond that it is useless. It does an okay job of that.

The Raspberry Pi Store is an attention-seeking creature, so celebrated its third birthday all year. We indulged it by booking a three-stop tour around the UK […]

                              <span>When Bayonetta 3&#x27;s first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game&#x27;s focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here&#x27;s a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta&#x27;s backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world,&quot; and it turns out he&#x27;s right in that we&#x27;ve never heard Pratt&#x27;s voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie&#x27;s villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you&#x27;d expect, in line with Illumination&#x27;s other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

Returning favorites from 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare like Ghost and Price make an appearance in the trailer as do newcomers to the series, both good and bad, all to the backdrop of the war on drugs, cartels, terrorism, and more.

                              <span>Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn&#x27;t just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game&#x27;s SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a &quot;unique&quot; phone number for authentication purposes.

An impressive result that won&#x27;t go unnoticed by some of the largest media companies in the world.

No longer. Valve say that they&#x27;ve increased their manufacturing capacity such that you can now buy a Steam Deck without a reservation.

They&#x27;ve also made the Steam Deck&#x27;s dock available to purchase. It costs $80/£80 and has the same 1-2 week delivery estimate as the Deck itself.

                              <span>Core developers of Disco Elysium were allegedly &quot;fired on false premises&quot;, according to Martin Luiga. Luiga, who worked on the game in its early days, made the comment in a new interview in which he also says that he believes &quot;fans had a right to know&quot; about the developers&#x27; departure from the studio.

More interestingly, it also includes a new expansion that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet.

                              <span>When the mysterious sci-fi action shooter Scars Above was first unveiled during Geoffcom&#x27;s Opening Night Live at the end of August, I thought it had big Returnal energy. Based on the reveal trailer, it certainly seemed to be riffing on several of the same themes as Housemarque&#x27;s challenging PlayStation exclusive - what with its lone female scientist stranded on an alien planet schtick, third-person shooting, and big eerie alien monsters after her etc. - so when I saw it was part of this month&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo bonanza, I knew I had to give it a try. And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I&#x27;m sorry to say that&#x27;s about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game.

Pre-orderers can play the campaign a week early, technically, but that’s still a good couple of weeks away as well. By the way, could you help me out? I can’t remember the actor who’s playing the shouty general’s name and it’s really bothering me. He’s in the trailer below, watch it and let me know in the comments please.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s be clear about one thing: whatever else I say today doesn&#x27;t deny that building games are in a great state right now. Within just the last few years, we&#x27;ve not only had many releases, but an impressive proportion of well-designed, enjoyable games made with obvious care and enthusiasm. Things, in a word, are good. And yet I keep coming back to Ostriv, and Workers &amp; Resources. Neither are out of early access yet. But they&#x27;ve had me contemplating the nature of a settlement, and the complex relationships between people, leaders, and the land itself, where so many of their peers feel like a dispassionate excercise in placing tokens.
Building games are doing well. But they could be doing more.

Yep, Need For Speed Unbound is looking pretty cel-shaded, with little cartoon streams of dust flying up from the wheels of your speeding vehicle. Substantially pimped-out vehicle, might I add, courtesy of rapper and general lad A$AP Rocky. Take a look at his motor in the trailer below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn&#x27;t even out yet and there&#x27;s already a rumour circulating that, to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary, the game&#x27;s going to receive a paid &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; map pack featuring a bunch of the classic maps from across the series. We&#x27;re talking favourites from Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games, and Treyarch, all rolled into one mega-bundle.
Of course, it&#x27;s only a rumour, which means it could be debunked at any moment. But it did get Hayden and I – the resident codders of the RPS Treehouse – thinking. If this rumour turns out to be true, which maps would we like to see return for Modern Warfare 2?

                              <span>Sci-fi colony simulator RimWorld is capable of generating some scenarios that could make The Sims 4 blush, and the newly announced Biotech expansion isn’t likely to change that. Y’see, Biotech introduces pregnancy, child-rearing, and families. It isn’t stopping there, because there’s also genetic engineering now. Your character will be able to psychically command semi-living machines too thanks to a special implant, making them your thralls. That’s one word for it, anyway.

The two week drought is broken with a shower of Electronic Wireless Show podcast rain, were we discuss the best villainous breakdowns we&#x27;ve enjoyed in video games. Matthew is sadly away this week because, while my coronavirus dose is mild, like the tingle of delicious Rio Tropical on your tongue, Matthew&#x27;s is wild and aggressive, like a super-charged Electricity Cop.
In his absence, Nate and I talk about some proper good villains, and even discuss some sensible things like evil cartoon monsters vs. villains you can sort of sympathise with. Handsome Jack? GLaDOS? LeChuck? Andrew Ryan? That&#x27;s one hell of an awkward dinner party. Plus stick around for a Cavern Of Lies that proves Warhammer 40k is essentially the same as Tumblr.

                              <span>Last month, I enjoyed playing Card Cowboy, a wee wild west adventure which uses cards to tell silly stories. As you cross the land in search of revenge, you build a hand of cards representing resources and events, which you use to resolve situations—often with strange and surprising results. What does happen if you try to lasso a villain with a mezcal worm? That free version was fun, and now the devs have expanded it into a £2 paid version with new cards, conundrums, and voice acting. It too is fun!

Ahead of Modern Warfare 2’s eruption on October 28th, rumours are circulating that Sledgehammer Games will return to the near-future world of their 2014 boots-off-the-ground instalment, Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. COD help us all.

The company originally insisted on all players providing a phone number as part of the hero shooter’s new anti-cheat system, dubbed Defense Matrix.

The High School Years update from July is also facilitating accidental sibling incest, still, after one method of sibling highschool be-sandwiching was fixed in August. It appears to be an entrenched problem. Those kids must really like House Of The Dragon.

                              <span>Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG&#x27;s Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG&#x27;s 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell&#x27;s even better S2721DGFA - and it&#x27;s this monitor that&#x27;s on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that&#x27;s already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!
So what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it&#x27;s not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that&#x27;s equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.

I have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I&#x27;ll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow for more deals.

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is one of the best portable SSDs on the market, and a ginormous 2TB model is currently discounted to £129 at Amazon, from its normal price of £150. This makes it the cheapest 2TB portable SSD by a significant margin, with alternatives like the Samsung T7 and SanDisk Extreme 2TB costing £191 or more - and an excellent value for a drive of this calibre.

It also reveals some co-op hunting action for the first time. Take a look at the footage below, and try not to giggle when the sproingy hammer whacks the giant piggy.

                              <span>Soccer sim FIFA 23 has been given its first patch since the Day One update, but don’t expect to encounter any earth-shattering changes when you next take to the pitch. Described as a “live tuning update”, the patch adjusts the difficulty of penalties and fiddles with dribbling speed for some players. These changes are already live in the game, but you’ll need to restart your FIFA session when the tuning update message pops up to apply it.

                              <span>Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn&#x27;t a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that&#x27;s your jam.
Whether you&#x27;re new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don&#x27;t know whether it goes beyond &quot;perfectly enjoyable&quot; into &quot;thrilling&quot;, though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it&#x27;s a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.

                              <span>Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man&#x27;s Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it&#x27;s a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn&#x27;t have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn&#x27;t have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. 
Upcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn&#x27;t have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn&#x27;t be has never left me, and I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn&#x27;t able to get back up to it again.

This time, the immersive sim shenanigans are going open-world. The Steam page also provides some inkling of what else is coming when the game launches in 2023. Did I mention it’s coming out in 2023?

                              <span>Last month, Rachel and I made the long pilgrammage to Seattle in order to attend PAX West 2022. While we were there we ran around the show floor with a bag full of loose camera equipment, stopping frequently to enthuse about cool video games we&#x27;d discovered or to interview someone interesting. At the time, all of these videos were only accessible to our premium supporters. However, as 30 days have passed since we originally shared them, we&#x27;re now making them free for everyone to enjoy. Surprise!
From an interview with the voice cast of Team Fortress 2 to a comprehensive tour of the show floor, there&#x27;s something for everyone in this bundle of audio-visual delights. Scroll down to see what we got up to, and remember, if you like what you see please do consider funding content like this via our supporters programme. It truly means an awful lot.

An interim order was obtained to keep the service down and, among other things, compel its alleged operators to reveal who else was involved in the operation. Both stand accused of contempt of court for alleged non-compliance.

                              <span>DISH Network has won yet another significant damages award following a lawsuit filed against a pirate IPTV supplier. The U.S. broadcaster filed a complaint against My Indian TV in August 2021, but the service stayed online until this April. DISH will now take control of the service&#x27;s domains but whether it will see any of the $26.5m awarded by a New York court remains to be seen.

                              <span>Earthlink has settled a piracy liability lawsuit filed by several movie companies this summer. While there is no mention of damages, the ISP has agreed to ask its wholesale providers to block access to the notorious pirate site YTS. The providers are not named but Earthlink sells or resold AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable infrastructure.

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It&#x27;s unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn&#x27;t want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn&#x27;t seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can&#x27;t access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.</span>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we&#x27;re just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today&#x27;s news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ&#x27;s most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what&#x27;s to come in the game&#x27;s second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it&#x27;s a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

                              <span>Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force and EA revealed Wild Hearts last week, giving players a glimpse of what&#x27;s to come in this new beast-hunting game. 
Similar to Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay.

Instead, the Umbra Witch is brought to life by veteran performer Jennifer Hale.

                              <span>In an update for investors, CD Projekt Red today outlined their &quot;long-term product outlook.&quot; It contains some projects we already knew about, such as next year&#x27;s Cyberpunk 2077 expansion Phantom Liberty, but also many that we did not. That includes a new trilogy of The Witcher RPGs, a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and a brand new IP being developed by CD Projekt Red, plus two further games in The Witcher universe being created by third-party studios.

                              <span>Put a screenshot of Overwatch 2 next to a screenshot of Overwatch 1, and you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to spot any difference. Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I&#x27;ve experienced in a game.
Guiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King&#x27;s Row and Route 66, it&#x27;s like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I&#x27;ve simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I&#x27;m not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.

This is what I experienced with Flat Eye, a story-heavy management sim where you&#x27;re in charge of a super-advanced gas station, where you harvest personal data from the port-a-loos, and feed the biological matter from those same toilets into your high-tech vending machine. Mmmmm. Flat Eye, the Next Fest demo for which you can download and play right now, is from Night Call devs Monkey Moon. I liked Night Call fine, but I really love the Flat Eye demo.

Overwatch took the gaming world by storm when it launched in 2016, thanks to its well-balanced roster of unique heroes and terrific objective-based, first-person-shooting gameplay. The game’s popularity endured through the years thanks to a wealth of new content like characters, maps, cosmetics, and game modes, adding to the terrific foundation. However, once the content dried up for Overwatch, the public interest followed shortly afterward. Overwatch 2 represents the re-emergence of one of…</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Nier Automata: The End of YoRHa Edition, a new version of the game exclusive to Switch. The two discuss how the game runs and looks on Switch, how the experience holds up five years after its original release, and whether Nier Automata is still worth playing all these years later. 
While Nier Automat has, over the year, hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, it has yet to reach a Nintendo platform...that is until this Thursday, October 6, when The End of YoRHa Edition is released. As for what to expect, this new edition of Nier Automata includes the following:
Nier Automata base game
All previously released DLC
New costumes exclusive to Switch
If you&#x27;re wondering whether Switch is the platform to play this on for newcomers, or if you&#x27;re wondering whether this new release is worth a replay, we have you covered in the latest New Gameplay Today, which you can watch below. Enjoy!

                              <span>The year 1985 contained so many cultural touchstones: Queen’s legendary Live Aid performance, Coca-Cola’s infamous New Coke release, the first-ever WrestleMania, and much more. Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.
Garbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…</span>

Platinum Games’ long-awaited threequel doesn’t rest on the laurels of its beloved predecessors. Gaming’s favorite witch has new tricks up her sleeves in the forms of Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, letting players utilize their demonic minions in combat in new, kaiju-sized ways. If one Bayonetta wasn’t enough, a multiversal storyline introduces several variants that bring their unique brands of flair. At the center of this crisis stands newcomer Viola, the second playable character and rookie Umbra Witch, who serves as a mysterious key to the game’s events.

This news comes by way of the studio&#x27;s investor call today, in which the studio revealed Orion, the codename for its next Cyberpunk game. Not much else was revealed, but CDPR says Orion &quot;will take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark future universe.&quot; 
Up next was The Witcher. CDPR has revealed that its next Witcher game, which was announced earlier this year, is being developed under the codename Polaris. The studio says &quot;it is the beginning of a new saga&quot; and that it aims to release two more Witcher games after Polaris, creating a new AAA RPG Witcher trilogy.

                              <span>EA and Motive Studios have released the first official gameplay trailer for the upcoming remake of Dead Space. 
The studio has been slowly releasing new information and video clips of this remake in its behind-the-scenes showcases focused on things like the game&#x27;s sound, visuals, or something else. But today&#x27;s trailer marks the first time we&#x27;ve seen this much official gameplay at once and it looks great. Terrifying, of course, but great. 
Check out the official Dead Space remake gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


And here are some high-resolution screenshots from today&#x27;s trailer: 

As you can see, this remake is looking awesome and we can&#x27;t wait to go hands-on with it. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer because it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 27, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed the first look at its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. 
Don&#x27;t get too excited just yet – this first look isn&#x27;t a trailer. But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don&#x27;t expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. 
Tune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).

Here&#x27;s a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film&#x27;s first poster:
As you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There&#x27;s Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario&#x27;s past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach&#x27;s castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There&#x27;s probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. 
This image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. 
Super Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.
While waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world&quot;. After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won&#x27;t have an Italian accent in the film.

                              <span>Sony might be interested in helping produce movies and television shows based on From Software games. 
This news comes by way of a new interview between Reuters and PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst, in which Hulst explains PlayStation&#x27;s investments into its PC and mobile efforts as of late, as well as its recent investment into Elden Ring developer From Software. According to Hulst, &quot;further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services&quot; is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. 


However, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst&#x27;s answer when asked about Sony&#x27;s investment in the studio. 
&quot;You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it&#x27;s also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,&quot; he said. 
While Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that&#x27;s not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio&#x27;s other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here&#x27;s hoping, though, because From Software&#x27;s properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. 
While waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that.

                              <span>Bloober Team has announced that its 2021 psychological horror game, The Medium, is getting a TV adaptation. 
The studio announced this in a new blog post today, as translated by Bloody Disgusting, which reveals Tomasz Bagiński, an executive producer for Netflix&#x27;s Witcher series, and Bloober Team&#x27;s own Piotr Babieno will oversee the show. 
&quot;Both the film industry and the video game industry are close to my heart, and I am very happy that there is finally an opportunity to bring them both together,&quot; Babieno writes in the blog post, according to Bloody Disgusting. &quot;The story we told in the game was appreciated by players, and now more people will be able to hear about it. The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.&quot; 
As noted in Babieno&#x27;s writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony&#x27;s God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions.

Much like my Liverpool fandom over the past 20 years, I vacillate between happily obsessive and begrudgingly bewildered with FIFA. Like Liverpool, when FIFA works like a well-oiled machine, play on the field is beautiful, slick, and drives my football-loving brain to elation with dopamine hits. However, FIFA 23 feels like FIFA 22, which was similar to FIFA 21, with additions ranging from mildly impactful to invigorating.
FIFA has focused on one facet of soccer for years: the attack. It’s almost arc…</span>

Once you get past its bizarre name, Dorfromantik offers simple, relaxing sessions of tile-matching puzzle goodness. Connecting hexagons to build pretty landscapes offers the thoughtful strategy of a city-builder to provide a stimulating yet overwhelmingly Zen atmosphere. 
Fans of the board game Carcassonne should quickly grasp Dorfromantik&#x27;s concept of drawing random tiles and finding high-scoring – and aesthetically pleasing – ways to place them on the field based on their scenery. Tiles only fit next to those with corresponding edges; r…</span>

                              <span>Dead Space fans will finally get a new look at gameplay for the upcoming remake of the first game. The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. 
Trailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.

This premiere is being dubbed as the &quot;first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we&#x27;re curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. 
Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>A remake or remaster of 2017&#x27;s Horizon Zero Dawn is reportedly in the works alongside a new Horizon multiplayer game. 
This news comes by way of MP1st, which reports that its sources tell the publication that this remake/remaster will feature an improved lighting system, overhauled textures, better animations, and character models more in line with those of Horizon Forbidden West, Zero Dawn&#x27;s sequel that released back in February. However, MP1ST notes that its sources didn&#x27;t say whether this was a &quot;built from the ground up&quot; remake or a remaster – it might fall somewhere in between for all we know. 


According to MP1st, one of the project&#x27;s big focuses (ha) is bringing Forbidden West&#x27;s accessibility features over to Zero Dawn, something Sony did with The Last of Us Part II and Part I. As f…</span>

That&#x27;s an awesome deal for what is already one of the best value PCIe 3.0 SSDs, offering sequential read speeds up to 2600MB/s and sequential write speeds up to 1800MB/s. That&#x27;s about five times faster than even the fastest SATA drive in terms of peak read speeds, making this an excellent choice for handling large files such as 4K videos, disc images and so on. 
To get this reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use the code SPEND15 at Ebay. This knocks £21 off the price, moving it from £140 to £119.

                              <span>In case September didn&#x27;t add enough new indie games to your burgeoning Steam wishlists, Valve are back today with another edition of their demo-packed Steam Next Fest, and we&#x27;ve been playing some of its many, many, many demos to help give you a few pointers on where to start. You can view the whole of October&#x27;s Steam Next Fest right here if you&#x27;d rather just dive in headfirst, but below you&#x27;ll find some hand-picked highlights we&#x27;ve been enjoying ahead of time - including a new Return Of The Obra Dinn-alike, a first-person skeleton shooter, an underwater citybuilders and a platformer where your gun is also an umbrella.

                              <span>A couple of weeks back you may remember that I played the early access build of Gloomwood, a very good Thief-like that currently snaps shut just as you reach the best bit. The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like &quot;Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.&quot;
You can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It&#x27;s just, I am an idiot.

So far, Bungie, IO Interactive and Ubisoft have issued statements to reassure Stadia users that they’re investigating ways to salvage their saves. It’s a welcome development following Google’s sudden shutdown revelation.

Well, Crystal Dynamics are running a survey seeking opinions about where a hypothetical next instalment in the series might go. They’re also checking whether anyone would be up for remasters or remakes of earlier games, such as Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver. If you don’t enjoy the sound of a satirical co-op beat ‘em up set in the vampiric realm of Nosgoth then you might want to chime in with your thoughts.

                              <span>When action RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn was revealed in March, its cinematic trailer struggled to conjure up anything more than a slight tinge of excitement. Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the &quot;Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.
Colour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, and chat to A44&#x27;s CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I&#x27;d expected, honestly, and I&#x27;ve come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.

                              <span>The RIAA has booked a landmark victory against YouTube-ripper Yout.com. The Connecticut District Court dismissed Yout&#x27;s request to declare the service as non-infringing. In a detailed ruling, Judge Stefan Underhill concludes that the service failed to show that it doesn&#x27;t circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. Yout is disappointed and will appeal the verdict.

                              <span>Zdaleka ne každý může utratit stovky dolarů za softwarové upgrady. To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft na vedlejší kolej snížením ceny za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, čímž činí proces aktualizace mnohem dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, a tím ušetříte ještě více. A tady je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…</span>

                              <span>Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won&#x27;t be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds &quot;for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,&quot; according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won&#x27;t be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you &quot;will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.&quot; 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says &quot;most hardware purchases...made directly from Google&quot; will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia&#x27;s January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn&#x27;t the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming&#x27;s continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.
