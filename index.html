Players will be able to approach any large body of water and cast a line. There will also apparently be fishing missions, tournaments and an &quot;Aquapedia&quot; where you can log everything you&#x27;ve caught. Players will also be able to use different fishing methods depending on the location.

The Japanese developer Monolith Soft has been growing in size year after year. In a previous update - dating back to 2021, the company revealed its employee headcount had jumped from 261 (in December 2020) to 272.
As highlighted by Twitter user and gaming enthusiast Stealth, the latest update for 2022 is slightly different - with new annual data revealing the amount of employees at the company has dropped from around 272 staff down to 264 as of December 2022. This is just an interesting fact, and there&#x27;s nothing to necessarily worry about.

The world of wrestling has plenty of overlaps with video games, especially for wrestlers who embody certain pieces of gaming iconography like Kenny Omega. And last night, the wrestler made a grand entrance at Wrestle Kingdom, to the tune of &quot;One Winged Angel.&quot;
At Wrestle Kingdom 17, an event put on by New Japan Pro Wrestling, Omega entered the ring to Sephiroth&#x27;s tune from Final Fantasy VII. Omega already has several ties to the silver-haired villain, including naming his incredible finisher after the song. For Wrestle Kingdom, though, things turned up a notch.
Making use of the massive screens for framing, Omega arrived in full Sephiroth attire. And in a glorious flourish, he extends his hand out with a massive, lone wing. Add in that pinpoint turn, and it&#x27;s a pr…</span>

                              <span>The publisher is making changes to its long-term plans
Future digital plans seem to be shifting for Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast. Several video games in development have reportedly been shut down by Wizards of the Coast, as the company looks to make changes in its long-term plans.
A new report from Bloomberg claims at least five video games have been cancelled by Wizards of the Coast. A spokesperson told Bloomberg that Wizards is &quot;committed&quot; to digital games. But it has also made changes to its long-term portfolio to &quot;focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing [Wizards&#x27;] existing brands&quot;, or that show promise in expanding or engaging their audience in new ways.
There will be under 15 people losing their jobs due to the changes, though the Wizards spokesperson tells Bloomberg that they will eb given a chance to seek new roles within the company. Both Hidden Path Entertainment and OtherSide Entertainment are studios potentially affected by the development, according to IGN.

Forgotten realms
Wizards of the Coast has been in the digital realm for a while, but has been making a heavier push in over the last few years. Notably, the company turned to Divinity developer Larian to take up the Baldur&#x27;s Gate series and work on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. While currently in Early Access, the RPG is slated to go live with its 1.0 version later this year. It&#x27;s been garnering some praise for its early efforts, too. Some other projects, like the Dark Alliance reboot, haven&#x27;t been so warmly received.
Wizards had previously stated it has &quot;seven or eight&quot; games set for the near future. It&#x27;s also been opening studios like Archetype Entertainment, to develop its own video game projects. Parent company Hasbro, however, has been facing a financial downturn, with shares falling 40% last year.
The post Wizards of the Coast has reportedly canceled at least five video game projects appeared first on Destructoid.</span>

Now stop imagining that, because it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll get to do when Control mode temporarily returns to Apex Legends next week as part of the Spellbound Collection Event. I think the idea&#x27;s got legs.

                              <span>The problem with game of the year lists, if your feet are suitably submerged in the PC Gaming swamp, is that they don&#x27;t tend to highlight anything you won&#x27;t have already heard about. That&#x27;s less true for ModDB&#x27;s Mod of the Year Awards, which can shine a light on experiences that may have slipped under your radar.  
This year&#x27;s publicly voted for crop (as with most year&#x27;s crops) was heavy on mods for old-school shooters, though mostly not too old-school for me to skip them. Second place was won by impressive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call Of Pripyat overhaul Anomaly, while first place went to Half-Life 2 mod Entropy: Zero 2. Check &#x27;em out below, along with the runner ups.

                              <span>Snazzy Stardew Valley-like town simulator My Time At Sandrock is running its first open beta for multiplayer next week, allowing owners of the game to hop into a separate multiplayer area set in a &quot;semi-fictional&quot; version of Sandrock&#x27;s past that includes &quot;compressed stories happening 50 years before single-player events&quot;. A pseudo prequel is an interesting form for a multiplayer mode to take, especially considering this is the pseudo sequel to My Time At Portia. 
The beta will run from January 12th - January 20th, after which any progress you&#x27;ve made will be wiped.

                              <span>Before our Christmas break, I left you with a big winter decision, and I return to see that you have dynamic snow is better than seasonal events. Having hugely enjoyed recent real-world snow but not really done much in terms of seasonal events, yes, this feels correct. Well done. Now our hunt for the best thing resumes, with a choice between rill rill and cold steel. What&#x27;s better: calling found phone numbers or giant swords?

Upcoming sci-fi Soviet FPS Atomic Heart seems chock-full of weird, mostly robotic things that want to kill you, and its latest trailer shows off all the ray-traced reflections and particle effects you can admire as they do so. We&#x27;ve seen a lot of this before, but it doesn&#x27;t half look pretty - and now at 4K, if you can handle that. I worry for my poor 1080p-tier GPU, though at least there&#x27;s also freshly-announced DLSS 3 support.

You only have ~24 hours left to nab yourself some good savings, so get at it! I&#x27;ve put down a handful of my own recommendations below, but I&#x27;m sure you can find other gems if you scroll for long enough. And of course, other giants like Elden Ring and the LEGO games are also heavily discounted.

If you logged into Madden NFL 23 during at least a 22-hour period last week, there&#x27;s a good chance your Connected Franchise Mode saves have been permanently corrupted. If that wasn&#x27;t galling enough, the corrupting period (from Wednesday December 28th to Thursday 29th) came immediately after EA gave people the go ahead to log in. 
EA have said they expect to recover 40% of the saves, the wallies.

And I did try to play some of them, for a bit. Elden Ring and Tunic were both too hard for my state of mind, which was as robust as pink candyfloss. Even Vampire Survivors wigged me out because it&#x27;s so visually busy by the end game, and I was in a more &quot;Ferrero Rocher and jigsaw of the London Underground map&quot; sort of place. My downfall was seeing PowerWash Simulator on sale on Steam. I bought it, and then played it for 40 hours.

The RPS Treehouse even named the bullet hell beast the best game of 2022 In a Steam community blog, developer Poncle celebrated the mega-successful year they just had, highlighting their accolades and the fact they were the most played game on Steam Deck over the last six months - half of that playtime probably came from me in my bed; you’re welcome, Poncle. But, despite their Vampire-y success, the devs have already begun to tease something &quot;not exclusively related&quot; to their big hit.

                              <span>Over New Year, the English seaside town of Scarborough received a rare Arctic visitor: a walrus, dubbed Thor, who rested in the harbour for several days. A feel-good novelty story in the news! What many news outlets politely neglected to mention is that, to the delight and horror of the gathered crowds, Thor had a big ol&#x27; wank in front of everyone. Thankfully, one chronicler of modern English culture is brave enough to capture this moment. Yes, absolutely a walrus cracking one off is now in Duke Smoochem, that astonishing upcoming Duke Nukem 3D level made by Dan Douglas.

                              <span>The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.
In a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,
“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”
Naughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. 
Though we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we&#x27;ll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there&#x27;s no such thing as a faithful remake.</span>

                              <span>Following the full reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, we had the opportunity to sit down with Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. In this video interview, we discuss everything from how Cal Kestis has grown as a Jedi between Fallen Order and Survivor, what it means to be a part of Star Wars canon, and how the sequel aims to delve into darker themes.
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 17. To view the first footage, head here.</span>

                              <span>Wizards of the Coast, the company behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, has reportedly canceled five unannounced games alongside layoffs affecting &quot;fewer than 15 people,&quot; according to a new Bloomberg report. 
The people that will lose their jobs will be given a chance to apply for new roles within WotC, but this apparent business restructuring will affect others outside of the company as well. Bloomberg reports that this reorganization will hit Otherside Entertainment and Hidden Path Entertainment, both working on games for WotC, hard. News of this change follows the release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&#x27;s release last year, which didn&#x27;t fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios&#x27; continued development on Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game&#x27;s publisher). 
These two games, in part, represented WotC&#x27;s bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also &quot;built at least six of its own game studios,&quot; according to the publication. 
One project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro&#x27;s shares fell 40% last year. 
Wotc told IGN that it remains &quot;committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,&quot; adding that it has &quot;made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.&quot;

                              <span>A supermajority of quality assurance workers at ZeniMax Studios, which is comprised of several studios like id Software, Arkane, and Bethesda, have voted to join the ZeniMax Workers United/Communication Workers of Amerca union. 
Roughly 300 QA workers at ZeniMax voted to indicate they wish to join this union, equating to a supermajority vote, and Microsoft has opted to recognize it. This lines up with what Microsoft said last month, where it announced that if these workers vote to unionize, it would voluntarily recognize the union. ZeniMax is the first studio in Microsoft&#x27;s umbrella of teams to unionize and it&#x27;s also now the largest group of unionized QA testers at any US-based studio.

As a woman who will probably some day have to wear an engagement ring, I have spent some amount of time thinking about what designs I actually like. Unfortunately, it turns out that most of them are designed to tear up any kind of knitted sweater as soon as you put your arms into the sleeves, and I cannot for the life of me understand how this is still a thing. I like wearing knitted sweaters!
The reason I bring this up is because this 1-carat solitaire ring, which comes in all gold, all platinum, and a mix of platinum and gold accents, looks like it was precision-engineered to ruin every single piece of knitwear known to man. However, it is also Pikachu-themed. I am torn.

When it comes to console special editions, Nintendo takes the biscuit. Whether it&#x27;s a colour variant, a game release exclusive, or a nod back to retro consoles of the past, the company is constantly looking for ways to get a &#x27;new&#x27; model out on the market and, so it seems, get the money out of our pockets.
No more so is this the case than with special edition Zelda designs. Here at Nintendo Life, it&#x27;s fair to say that we are fans of the series — hands up, you got us — and a brief survey of our staff revealed a tidy collection of Zelda-themed consoles between us. And this should come as no surprise because a Death Mountain-sized pile of them have been released over the years that positively (Ganon)dwarfs all other series-specific console designs (ok, maybe except Pokémon special editions, though that&#x27;s a discussion for another day).

If we were tasked with naming the three creepiest things in the world, in order, it would be: Pointing, clicking, and Yorkshire. Finally, at last, someone has made a game with all three, and it&#x27;s called The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow. Anyone who&#x27;s ever enjoyed pointing, clicking, Yorkshire, and horrible eldritch monstrosities should be sure to check it out when it points and clicks its way onto Switch very soon.
The game takes place in 19th century England, in the remote village of Bewlay, as city girl and archaeologist Thomasina Bateman arrives to investigate a mysterious barrow (read: burial mound) out on the desolate moors. Unsurprisingly, the townsfolk aren&#x27;t happy to have someone new in their village — cue a lot of Hot Fuzz-like &quot;yer not from around &#x27;ere&quot;, except in a Yorkshire accent. Thomasina has to bargain, bribe, and bother people to get permission to excavate for her (thrilling) book about England&#x27;s barrows. But she might come to rue the effort...

AI generated art has been gaining some serious traction over the last year or so, and much to the chargrin of real artists, the whole concept has undoubtedly improved drastically to produce some pretty convincing pieces.
Then again, lots of it still has the potential to cause a few nightmares here and there, and this latest batch from Merchoid is sure to cause a few of you to break out in a cold sweat. Based on the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie from Nintendo and Illumination, the images depict the movie&#x27;s actors, including Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, and more, and combines them with the overall look of their Mario characters. The result is, well... troubling, to say the least.

We&#x27;re a few days into 2023 now, but many places are still looking back at last year&#x27;s biggest and best games. And review aggregate site Metacritic is joining in, compiling multiple lists based on compiled reviews from multiple publications.
Today, the site has revealed the Switch&#x27;s best-reviewed games of 2022. The top 40 has some real big hitters like Triangle Strategy, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Splatoon 3, and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and there&#x27;s a real juicy mix of indies too like Beacon Pines (which one of us in particular really loved and wrote about), Infernax, and Citizen Sleeper.

Last year&#x27;s Switch port of the Pokémon-like creature catcher/battler Temtem may not have taken the world by storm quite as rapidly as some expected, but it is fair to say that the team at Crema are working hard to consistently bring improvements to the game (thanks, Go Nintendo).
This progressive eye is continuing into the New Year as the developer has announced that a small update will be coming to the game next week (9th January) and will focus on patching some of the problems that arose with the addition of ver.1.2. These problems included issues with the Switch memory and game crashes amongst others, so it is good to see that the team are working on a solution.

A rhythm game comprised of over 20 unique minigames has comfortably exceeded its Nintendo Switch stretch goal on Kickstarter with the campaign set to end in just a handful of hours at the time of writing.

                              <span>Some new concept art teases more of The Last of Us
Naughty Dog is celebrating the 10th anniversary of The Last of Us this year, and it&#x27;s planning to share some news as part of it. The studio shared a new piece of concept art for its The Last of Us multiplayer game that&#x27;s in the works, and says more news is on the way for 2023.
The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann announced this in a blog, detailing the franchise&#x27;s history up to now and its future potential. Looking ahead to the 10th anniversary, the team plans to share more about the future of The Last of Us franchise, specifically spotlighting the multiplayer game.
&quot;We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game,&quot; said Druckmann. &quot;With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.&quot;
There&#x27;s also a new piece of concept art for this unnamed multiplayer project, showing off what the team has been working on. We can see some ruins and rusted scenery, but mainly, a seemingly beached cruise liner. Odds are high that place has some nasty infected inside.

What&#x27;s left of us
The Last of Us looks to have a big year in 2023, between more multiplayer news and the upcoming premiere of the HBO adaptation on January 15. Druckmann says that over the course of the season, there will be an inside look at the original The Last of Us, its Part 1 remake, and the adaptation. It&#x27;s been a decade since Joel and Ellie first set out, and the pair&#x27;s cross-country adventures seem poised to make a big return this year.

With its uncanny robots, fearsome enemies, and slick style, Atomic Heart has to be one of my most anticipated games of 2023. It somehow manages to reference all of our favorite blockbuster games while still managing to carve a path of its own -- naturally I&#x27;m excited to see a game going all out to try something new. We&#x27;ve gotten to see a nice lineup of trailers since Atomic Heart was announced back in 2017, and now we&#x27;ve got one more to add to the list. During Nvidia&#x27;s CES 2023 showcase, the devs behind the game, Mundfish, let fans in on how amazing the game&#x27;s ray-tracing and particle effects will look, especially in 4K.
This new trailer came along with an announcement that Nvidia DLSS, or deep learning super sampling, technology will be supported on 33 upcoming games, of course including Atomic Heart. The company describes DLSS as &quot;a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance.&quot; That sounds great to me, but I&#x27;m also assuming you have to have the latest graphics cards and processors to be able to run it. Not to mention a 4K monitor and all the fixins that go along with it. I&#x27;ll likely play it on the PS5, because I&#x27;m probably the least tech savvy person in all of gaming. I hope the computer whizzes out there have fun though.

I can say with confidence that Atomic Heart is going to look incredible with top-of-the-line graphics, but I also think it&#x27;s going to be a gorgeous game regardless of specs. It has such a fun, distinct art style and atmosphere, I think Mundfish will have it locked down regardless of which platform we choose to play the game on. I&#x27;ve certainly been let down before, but if nothing else, it&#x27;s cool to see a studio putting something out that&#x27;s so different from what we&#x27;ve seen in the past few years. Nice graphics are just icing on the cake.

IO Interactive has announced plans to consolidate its celebrated Hitman trilogy into one singular platform — Hitman: World of Assassination, will see the missions, modes, DLC, and in-game store of the highly celebrated murder simulators brought together in one easy-to-access dashboard.
Launching January 26, Hitman: World of Assassination will become the singular purchasable entity with which to play Hitman (2016), Hitman 2 (2018), and Hitman III (2021). All Hitman III owners will be automatically upgraded to the new platform, with the option of adding all of their additional Hitman and Hitman 2 content. On Steam, a &quot;complete the set&quot; option will allow players to fill in the gaps within their Hitman collection at a discounted price, omitting the content th…</span>

                              <span>One first party exclusive made it into the top 10
With 2022 fully in the rear view mirror, it&#x27;s time to check in and see how the year went. For the Nintendo Switch, things were mostly good! Metacritic however has their story to tell, including a full &quot;top 40&quot; breakdown of the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022.
Note that the criteria is fairly broad, as it involves every game from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that had at least seven reviews; ranked entirely by Metascore (ratings).
The top 10 Switch games of 2022, according to Metacritic:
Portal Companion Collection
Persona 5 Royal
Xenoblade Chronicles 3
NieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition
Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration
Neon White
Tunic
Cuphead in the Delicious Last Course
13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe
Seeing a first party Nintendo game in the top five is unsurprising: but it is a bit shocking that there aren&#x27;t more in there. The rest of the list is filled with ports of celebrated games (Persona 5 Royal, NieR Automata), as well as timed console exclusives like Neon White (which was only on PC and Switch for roughly six months). On the flipside there&#x27;s games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which only just came to Switch this year after it was exclusive to the PS4 since 2019. It&#x27;s a good mix! Several sole Switch exclusives were kept off the top 10 list due to a mixed reception (mainly looking at the new Pokemon generation).
It just goes to show you that the Switch really has carved out a spot for itself as a port machine that people prefer; and a platform that can deliver high quality ports if the studios are up to the task. You can find the full breakdown here, including the entire top 40.

When you ask a rhythm game fan to list their favorite titles, good money says that they&#x27;ll start rattling off a bunch of games you can&#x27;t actually play. Many of the &quot;best&quot; rhythm games are available only to those with access to a halfway-decent arcade or expensive peripherals. Most of those expensive and inaccessible games are excellent, but what are the odds that you&#x27;ll actually play Dance Dance Revolution A20 or Rock Band 3 in the near future?
If you&#x27;re like me and only have a couple of modern consoles and a halfway decent PC, it can be hard to break into rhythm gaming. Thankfully, there are plenty of top-tier titles readily available on modern platforms. They might not be quite as good as the finest offerings at a Round1, but they do have the undeniable benefit of bein…</span>

Hidden Variable has released the previously announced &quot;major update&quot; for the Nintendo Switch edition of cartoonish tag-fighter Skullgirls 2nd Encore. More than just a balance patch, the new update rebuilds much of the game&#x27;s engine at a core level, in efforts to severely improve the Switch edition&#x27;s performance.
The update, practically a full reinstall of the base game, features fully-rewritten code that increases the load times of the Switch port, while also tightening up online play, ensuring more stable performance, and wiping out a litany of small, troublesome bugs. Hidden Variable hopes that this new version of Skullgirls 2nd Encore will offer Nintendo players their best experience with the fighter to date.

In addition, the new update brings with it the addition of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass. Switch players can now pick up previously released season one characters — such as Annie of the Stars and Umbrella — while bringing the game up to parity with the PC and console editions in regards to balance and tournament standard features. This update has been a long time coming, and finally sees the Switch Skullgirls community rewarded for their patience.
2023 promises to be a big year for the long-life fight franchise. The coming months will see the arrival of the sinister assassin, Black Dahlia, as well as new stages, character color palettes, webtoons, merchandise, and more. For a full report on Skullgirls&#x27; road ahead, be sure to check out our exclusive feature from last month — which includes some first-ever looks at character model sheets and animatics!
Skullgirls 2nd Encore is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.

Publisher Prime Matter, in association with developers Starbreeze Studios and Overkill Software, have started off their 2023 with a bang — a block of C4, to be precise — with an update on the long-awaited multiplayer sequel Payday 3, which will be donning masks and raiding vaults later in 2023.
The studios released a short teaser video, debuting the shooter sequel&#x27;s logo but sadly devoid of any actual in-game footage. Regardless, it was announced that Payday 3 would be launching on PC (via Steam) and unspecified console platforms later this year, in news that will no doubt cause a lot of itchy trigger fingers among veteran heisters. A new FAQ reveals that the title will be set in New York, and will see the return of gang members Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf…</span>

A heads-up for all of you shopaholics that Sony Interactive Entertainment has refreshed its ongoing PlayStation Holiday Sale, adding thousands of titles with discounts up to a huge 75%. The sale, which began at the tail-end of December will now run until Wednesday, January 18.
Obviously, there&#x27;s little point in me picking out specific titles, but a huge breadth of genres and releases are covered here, from retro classics to some of 2022&#x27;s finest. Deluxe Editions and DLC are also up for grabs, along with a wide variety of indie hits and Japanese obscurities. I&#x27;m in no doubt that you might have already burned out your bank accounts over the past fortnight, but that&#x27;s why the stagger the additions this way. Pretty sneaky, sis.

The ongoing battle between The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Microsoft over the latter&#x27;s proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard rages on — And, according to recent comments by the former, it looks like neither side has been willing to give up a single yard, leading toward a clear impasse.
Speaking in a telephone hearing on Tuesday, FTC attorney James Weingarten noted that there has been no &quot;substantive&quot; settlement talks between the trade body and the publisher, suggesting that the two parties will have no option but to pursue the FTC&#x27;s filed suit to legal trial, which is tentatively set for August of this year.
As we have frequently reported, the FTC is one of a number of statutory bodies that are currently refusing to offer its appr…</span>

The QA department of ZeniMax Media has voted in favor of establishing a union within its office walls. Some 306 workers within the company&#x27;s U.S. gaming division sought unionization within a recently held ballot, overseen by the Communication Workers of America (CWA).
ZeniMax Workers United has already been officially recognized by company owner Microsoft, following a deal made with the CWA in June 2022 where the union regulator offered their approval in regards to the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard acquisition in return for Microsoft on any proposed union action — And thus, MS offered no resistance and full cooperation regarding the ZeniMax team&#x27;s motion.

It&#x27;s time for another limited-time event from Overwatch 2, and this time they&#x27;re going for a Greek mythology-themed romp with Battle for Olympus. The free-for-all deathmatch mode will be available to play January 5-19, and will give seven heroes on the game&#x27;s roster a whole host of new god-like abilities. Some of the affected characters will include Widowmaker, who will turn enemies to stone, Junker Queen, who will call lightning down during her ultimate to do devastating damage, and Roadhog, who will turn into a giant cyclops.
Blizzard released a trailer as part of the event&#x27;s announcement, which revealed a good number of details about what we can expect from Battle for Olympus. Players will be able to earn &quot;divine rewards,&quot; and while they don&#x27;t specify what that entails, it&#x27;s likely to be the usual roundup of voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and hopefully the skins that we can see in the trailer, because they look sick as hell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NbI57nJsAkU
The epic free-for-all battles will take place on what I consider the best arcade map: Château Guillard. But the fun doesn&#x27;t stop there, because after the event is over, whichever hero has secured the most eliminations throughout the event will get a marble statue of their likeness added to the control map Ilios. Looks like our favorite heroes have a chance at immortality.
While Overwatch 2 hasn&#x27;t exactly been my favorite game as of late, I am a sucker for Greek mythology. I&#x27;m not alone here, and Blizzard knows exactly what they&#x27;re doing in getting some more players back into the game. It looks like the game&#x27;s second Season is gonna be chock full of events, because even before Battle for Olympus concludes, we&#x27;ll be into the Lunar New Year event that runs from January 17-February 6 this year.

There are three other questions/answers about the game on the site, but no new info - which isn&#x27;t weird considering, y’know, the game’s not actually out yet - aside from the message “Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC in the first half of 2023.”

                              <span>In a New Year’s message, Square Enix’s CEO Yosuke Matsuda reaffirmed the company’s focus on blockchain technology with “multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development” despite the public backlash against the initiative. This echoes Matsuda’s New Year’s message from last January, where the company first expressed its enthusiasm for an NFT-fueled, metaverse future. More recently, Squeenix partnered with the “environmentally friendly” blockchain firm Oasys, probably to sidestep potential controversies about, y&#x27;know, the environmental impact of the technology.

Development on the horror game goes back to at least 2017 when Alice0 managed to go hands-on with an early prototype before it entered early access in February 2020.

                              <span>Get a closer look at the Lands Between
For super fans, buying an art book can be one of the most gratifying pieces of merch you can collect, whether it&#x27;s for their favorite show, film, or of course, game. I&#x27;m someone who really loves to see how the sausage gets made, and having a book I can flip through from time to time and get a peek at the artistic process behind one of my favorite things is weirdly important to me. If you&#x27;re a fan of Elden Ring and feel the same way, you&#x27;re in for a treat, because FromSoftware has opened the pre-orders for the game&#x27;s two-volume art book.
As the best books usually are, these volumes are both oversized hardbacks at 8.25&quot; x 11.75&quot;. There&#x27;s plenty of content for FromSoft to show off, because the first volume is 432 pages, and the second is 384 pages long. The former will feature art of the game&#x27;s opening cinematic, as well as key art, concept art, and development design documents focused on the Lands Between, its dungeons, characters, and armor designs. The latter volume will highlight the game&#x27;s enemies, items, and weapons.

It&#x27;s looking like Amazon is the only place to pre-order the books in the western regions as of now, but there&#x27;s a chance that they&#x27;ll be available from other retailers once we&#x27;re closer to the July 25, 2023 release date. As of now the books are also both listed for $59.99 a pop, so they&#x27;ll be an investment for sure.
For a game as big and beautiful as Elden Ring, it would be a real shame for any of the development work to go unnoticed, because the team clearly worked hard to bring its world to life. Like I said, I love art books on principle, but I truly can&#x27;t think of a property that&#x27;s more deserving of one.

                              <span>The series feels like it lost its heart
Overwatch is by far my most-played game of all time, clocking in somewhere in the 1,000+ hours mark over multiple accounts. I used to play with a team every night in college, and I got so close with those guys, I even went to one of their weddings. It was a huge part of my life for a long time, and then it just... wasn&#x27;t. The game started to change, my life got busier, and I simply moved on to other things. Every few months I would log back in for a match or two to reminisce, but I had to admit to myself that the best of my Overwatch career was behind me.
Then, of course, there was the announcement of Overwatch 2. I was skeptical that we needed a sequel in the first place, but I was at Blizzcon in 2019. My apprehension was immediately overridden by s…</span>

Fall Guys has always had a great lineup of themed costumes, from Sonic to Ratchet &amp; Clank to Portal. Their newest collaboration with yet another fan-favorite franchise is dropping January 5, and this time fans will get an opportunity to don skins from one of the most beloved animated series of recent memory: Invincible. Skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve will be available for purchase in the Fall Guys store in collaboration with Skybound Games, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you see some new super-friends soaring through your matches soon. Of course, Fall Guys is a family friendly game, so we won&#x27;t be seeing quite as much blood and gore as we&#x27;re used to from these characters.

Amazon Prime&#x27;s acclaimed animated series Invincible is based on a comic series of the same name, written by Walking Dead comic author Robert Kirkman. Season one was a massive success when it dropped in 2021, even spawning a series of popular memes, and while we know another season is supposed to drop sometime this year, it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess as to when we can expect it. Some fans are hoping that this Fall Guys collab means we&#x27;ll be getting an update soon, and I&#x27;m certainly in that boat myself.
Fall Guys has also seen a resurgence since it went free-to-play last year, and rightfully so. I returned to the game recently after not having touched it since 2020, and it&#x27;s probably even more fun than I remember due to all the new stages and content that they&#x27;ve added. My backlog has been keeping me plenty busy as of late, but Fall Guys is one of those games I know I&#x27;ll be coming back to when my schedule clears up a bit. Certainly as a fan of the Invincible series, it&#x27;ll be worth logging on to see if I can&#x27;t secure some of these new skins.

                              <span>We&#x27;re off again, lil&#x27; buddy
Skunkape Games has announced that it has begun development of Sam &amp; Max: The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse Remastered, following on from its previously released remasters of Telltale Games classics Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered and Sam &amp; Max: Beyond Time and Space Remastered. This latest retread will launch on unannounced platforms later in 2023.
First released on PC and PS3 way back in 2010, The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse was the third of Telltale Games&#x27; Sam &amp; Max adventures, and sees the Freelance Police investigate a series of strange phenomena linked to the powerful psychic machinations of the mysterious &quot;Toys of Power&quot;. The original release of The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse sported a fresh new game engine, and allowed the player to take direct control of both Sam and Max independently — allowing for a shakeup of the title&#x27;s puzzle elements and adding an extra emphasis on synergy and teamwork between the two characters.

While Skunkape Games has not offered any official information on the new title, we can likely expect The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse Remastered to feature updated character models and environmental textures, tauter controls, and slicker U.I. integration. If we&#x27;re lucky, we might also see the new release include additional artwork, voicework, and music, as was the case for both Save the World Remastered and Beyond Time and Space Remastered. We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information — including platforms and a release date — is forthcoming.
Sam &amp; Max: The Devil&#x27;s Playhouse Remastered is currently in development at Skunkape Games.

Happy new year folks! Here&#x27;s to another fine year of this fine pastime of video gaming, and it seems that many of Japan&#x27;s biggest developers and publishers are all ready and raring to bring fun new adventures your way in 2023... They just aren&#x27;t exactly ready to come forward with any titles, release dates, platforms, or trailers...
As part of the myriad Happy New Year messages dropped by multiple studios, a lot of titles were certainly teased — in as much as it was revealed that they exist, somewhere, in somebody&#x27;s desk.
[Thanks to Gematsu and Famitsu for the translations of the studios&#x27; messages.]
Konami led the charge, teasing &quot;power-ups&quot;, (whatever the hell that means), and &quot;new developments for familiar series&quot; while also &quot;quietly prog…</span>

If I could do it all over again, I wouldn&#x27;t get out of shape, I would&#x27;ve gotten into this gig at a younger age, and, above all, I would&#x27;ve learned to drive as soon as I was out of school. And this holiday — as the frosted winter air and expensive hotel prices keep me from a fun party — I&#x27;m reminded of how much freedom the open road allows those with four wheels and a tank of gas. No clock checking, no canceled buses, and no overnight stay necessary. Just you and the road...
...And a thousand misanthropic, angry people in huge metal death machines.
In addition to freedom, having your own vehicle provides some with a sense of identity, even purpose. These are the people for whom the car is like a trophy lover, to be gifted with expensive presents, treated with lo…</span>

Developer Nightdive Studios has announced that its troubled, long-in-development remake of sci-fi horror classic System Shock is entering its final development phases, and is officially expected to launch on PC, via Steam, this coming March.
One can forgive fans for eyeing this news with suspicion, as the System Shock remake has been through a helluva lot of delays and licensing troubles ever since its initial announcement way back in 2016. Since then, System Shock has been tentatively announced for several release windows, from 2017 through 2020 and into 2021. In a new update on the project&#x27;s Kickstarter page, however, Nightdive Studios openly acknowledges the remake&#x27;s delayed development.

Pocket Card Jockey remains one of my all-time favorite games for the Nintendo 3DS. I absolutely adore that little mash-up of solitaire and horse racing. In fact, it&#x27;s one of just two games that I still play with some regularity on my New Nintendo 2DS XL (the other being Fantasy Life). That&#x27;ll change later this month when Pocket Card Jockey comes to Apple Arcade. Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! revives the Game Freak classic for iOS devices as an Apple Arcade exclusive. The game will feature races rendered in 3D along with the classic gameplay that made it so addictive.
You might remember Game Freak had ported the original Pocket Card Jockey to Android not long after the game launched for 3DS, but that version was never localized outside of Japan. While this version of the game is different than the Android port, it is yet another long-lost mobile title that has been rescued for the Apple Arcade service. You might remember PlatinumGames&#x27; World of Demons disappeared from app stores after its original soft release only to pop up as an Apple Arcade exclusive many months later. The same thing happened with Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls.
While the Apple Arcade release calendar isn&#x27;t as exciting as it once was, it is comforting to know that Apple is sticking with the service and bringing fun new titles like Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! to subscribers. Ride On! is one of a few games announced for a January release, with the others being Episode XOXO from Pocket Gems, the jigsaw puzzler Illustrated, and physics puzzler Squiggle Drop.

When I was a kid, a lot of my friends matured earlier than I did. While I was still watching cartoons and playing with stuffed animals, they moved on to more “mature” forms of entertainment, like WCW or In Living Color. For whatever reason, I was determined to stay a kid for as long as possible, even if that made me uncool. One show that absolutely kept me in that adolescent state of mind was Rugrats. I know I’ve written about my adoration for that show on this site before, but I can’t overstate what an impact that Nicktoon had on me. It’s the sole reason my imagination is as active and vibrant today as it was 30 years ago.
I was well into my teens before I finally stopped watching and grew up, but it’s because of that show that I have great admiration and apprecia…</span>

Square Enix has kicked off its 2023 with a reaffirmation of its commitment to controversial and fragile blockchain gaming sector. As noted by Eurogamer, the company&#x27;s annual New Year&#x27;s letter, sees president Yosuke Matsuda reiterate that the publisher aims to release multiple blockchain-based games in the future.
&quot;Our Group has multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development, some of which we announced last year, and we are undertaking preparations that will enable us to unveil even more titles this year,&quot; writes Matsuda. &quot;We are also engaged in global sourcing from an investment perspective and will continue to take stakes in promising businesses whether we find them in Japan or abroad.&quot;

                              <span>The Year of the Lamb... like it or not
Devolver Digital has announced that one of the sleeper hits of 2022, Massive Monster&#x27;s Cult of the Lamb, will receive a free major content update later this year, bringing a selection of new features, options, and accessibility functions to the super-cute, super horrifying anthro roguelike.
While details are a little bit on the thin side, a tweet from the eccentric publisher notes that the update will be bringing a selection of tweaks to add more overall depth to the title, with a short clip teasing an all-new &quot;heavy attack&quot; mechanic. In addition, new difficulty settings will be added to the sacrificial adventure as well as several unspecified accessibility options and &quot;quality-of-life&quot; tweaks. Neat!

Released in the summer of 2022, Cult of the Lamb blends cutesy visuals and ultra-dark humor in its tale of a young lamb who, having seemingly had their life saved by a sinister deity, goes about preaching the word of this supposed savior and building an ever-growing cult around its teachings. Cult of the Lamb would itself amass a huge fan following, eventually making its way onto several Game of the Year nomination lists, (including our own), and even taking home several gongs at the Australian Game Developer Awards.
Cult of the Lamb is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

2023 is underway, and, like clockwork, all of the studios and publishers are taking to the airwaves to offer non-descript teases for their new year&#x27;s wares — Perhaps the most notable of these has come from Square Enix producer Yoshinori Kitase, who has teased a &quot;big announcement&quot; concerning the legendary Final Fantasy franchise.
Interestingly, however, Kitase notes that the announcement is unrelated to the ongoing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth project, which Kitase is helming alongside the team at SE&#x27;s Creative Business Unit I. While it is believed that the second chapter of the epic remake series is scheduled to launch in the winter of this year, the mystery announcement seemingly concerns an entirely different project.

France-based Kalray that focuses on high-performance, data-centric computing from cloud to edge posted their initial Linux kernel patches today for their &quot;KVX&quot; kernel port to get the kernel running on their MPPA3-80 &quot;Coolidge&quot; DPU SoC with the KV3-1 CPU architecture...</span>

While just over one month ago FESCo rejected that change, they re-voted today and decided after all to allow this change to happen but to ensure that packages can easily opt-out if they find performance regressions. By Fedora 40 they will also re-visit the matter to determine if the benefits and performance costs are justified...</span>

Cast your mind back to the hazy days of 2013. In that year the Game Boy Advance SP was celebrating its 10th anniversary, we contemplated the squareness of the Nintendo 2DS, A Link Between Worlds brought us back to the glory days of Zelda.

At the start of December 2022, we reported that a trademark for &#x27;Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!&#x27; had been filed by Game Freak. At the time, we weren&#x27;t quite sure what this would be in reference to, but now we have our answer (thanks, VGC).
We&#x27;ve got good news and bad news, folks. The good news is that the cult classic 3DS title Pocket Card Jockey is getting a new, modern release with revamped 3D visuals for the horse racing events. The bad news is that it isn&#x27;t coming to the Switch. Instead, Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! will be released exclusively on Apple Arcade for iOS devices.

                              <span>No alien wars, thankfully.
Over the years, narratives in pop culture mediums have hypothesised over how the future might turn out for the human race: in James Cameron&#x27;s Terminator 2: Judgement Day, 1997 would have seen Earth decimated by Skynet&#x27;s new-found sentience; Back to the Future Part II visualised a 2015 in which we&#x27;d all be cruising around on hoverboards and rocking self-drying jackets; Blade Runner went wild and thought that the year 2019 would see bioengineered replicants roaming about Earth after escaping off-world colonies.
Now, it&#x27;s the turn of Perfect Dark. Released back in 2000 for the N64, Rare&#x27;s first-person shooter depicted a world set in the year 2023 during which two alien races - the Maians and the Skedar - are locked in an interstellar war. On Earth, two rival corporations known as The Carrington Institute and dataDyne are both in league with the Maians and the Skedar respectively. Joanna Dark, the game&#x27;s protagonist, carries out multiple missions including the elimination of a clone of the President, and the destruction of the Skedar leader on the alien homeworld.

Maybe Gloria Estefan was right, and the rhythm is, in fact, gonna get you. Melatonin certainly thinks so.
This debut from indie studio Half Asleep is named for the brain hormone that helps you sleep (starting to see a pattern here). It’s a pretty pastel rhythm game where you enter an insomniac’s puzzling dreams to press or hold buttons in time with a beat. But the dreams are not really a story so much as a loose structure for a series of minigames. Because, for a game about relaxation and sleep, Melatonin really requires you to be wide awake.

                              <span>But we&#x27;ll need your help.
2023 is going to be a pretty big year for the Switch. It&#x27;s only the start of January, but we already know that we&#x27;re going to be playing the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fire Emblem Engage, Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Pikmin 4 within the next 12 months, and that&#x27;s all while being fully aware that Nintendo likely has a boatload of other surprises up its sleeve. Phew!
We are, however, a sentimental bunch here at Nintendo Life, and we love our 3DS consoles. The problem, though, is that most people have understandably moved on and are now taking their Switches out and about on their travels. What the Switch lacks, however, is the excellent StreetPass feature from the 3DS, and we reckon its about time we start getting those sweet dopamine hits from the green StreetPass notification light once again.

                              <span>Fall Guys is becoming Invincible with the arrival of skins from the acclaimed animated series this week.
With season 2 of Invincible set to premiere on Amazon Prime sometime this year, Fall Guys is whetting fans’ appetite with skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve. The outfits hit the in-game store on January 5, and that hopefully means a release date announcement for the series won&#x27;t be too far behind. 
Invincible, Omni-Man and Atom Eve are flying into the Fall Guys Store on the 5th of Jan! @skyboundgames

Fall Guys enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in 2022. In addition to its usual deluge of seasonal content updates, it went free-to-play in May and launched on Xbox and Switch, gaining a larger player base of contestants and renewed interest in general. We look forward to seeing what 2023 brings for the title, but this is a pretty good start.

                              <span>Polish developer The Astronauts have revealed a new trailer for their upcoming rogue-lite shooter Witchfire. In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will &quot;massively boost performance.&quot; You can watch the trailer below.


Announced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game&#x27;s performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA&#x27;s site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. &quot;DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,&quot; Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. &quot;A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.&quot;
Witchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. 
The game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn&#x27;t always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world&#x27;s design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here&#x27;s hoping that &quot;early 2023&quot; ends up being as soon as possible.</span>

                              <span>New year, new content: Cult of the Lamb is getting a &quot;major content update&quot; sometime in 2023. According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.
This Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!

The biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword&#x27;s heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it&#x27;s &quot;just one small tidbit&quot; of what&#x27;s still to come.
The update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won&#x27;t be released until after that. Their release window also isn&#x27;t any more specific than &quot;2023,&quot; so it could come out any time this year.

                              <span>IO Interactive has announced that Hitman 3 will become Hitman World of Assassination later this month and will include all levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 in it for free. 
More specifically, this big update for the Hitman trilogy arrives on January 26 and includes two major changes: 
&quot;Hitman 3 will become &#x27;Hitman World of Assassination,&#x27; which will also include access to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 through our existing Access Pass system. Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.&quot;
&quot;We&#x27;re drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.&quot; 


This update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. 
Hitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. 
&quot;Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,&quot; IO writes in a blog post. &quot;The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.&quot; 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.

                              <span>The long-in-development remake of System Shock will finally be released this March. 
This news comes by way of a new Kickstarter update from developer Nightdive Studios, which states the team has picked &quot;a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March 2023.&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This remake, which is set to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC has had a 2023 release year attached to it for a minute now, but this new Kickstarter update points attention to the game&#x27;s Steam page, which now features a &quot;March 2023&quot; release window. 
&quot;As some of you have already pointed out, this is not our first time announcing a tentative launch window, but over the past few years, much has changed – the scope and scale of the proj…</span>

                              <span>Developer Starbreeze Studios and publisher Koch Media have released a new teaser trailer that calls 2023 &quot;the year of PayDay 3.&quot; Presumably, this means the co-op shooter is still on track to release sometime this year. 
Koch gave PayDay 3 a 2023 release window way back in March of 2021, detailing the game&#x27;s new publishing deal alongside news that there is at least 18 months of post-launch support planned for the title. Later that year, in June, Koch released a new piece of concept art, citing that PayDay 3 will feature a &quot;fully-fledged social heist universe&quot; set within a Hollywood-like setting. That was the last we saw of PayDay 3 until yesterday, when IGN revealed the &quot;official reveal trailer&quot; for the game, although considering how little is shown in it, it&#x27;s less of a reveal and more of a teaser. 
Check out this new PayDay 3 trailer below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to this trailer other than it calling 2023 &quot;the year of PayDay 3.&quot; Here&#x27;s hoping that holds true.

                              <span>Starfield, the new and upcoming sci-fi RPG from Skyrim makers Bethesda Softworks, was originally due out in November of 2022, but it was delayed to the first half of 2023 last May. Starfield was then a big part of an Xbox showcase last summer and during that showcase, Microsoft revealed that every game shown would be coming in the first half of 2023. 
Now, a new Bethesda support page for the game has reconfirmed this &quot;first half of 2023&quot; window, as spotted by Klobrille on Twitter.
&quot;Starfield arrives exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC in the first half of 2023,&quot; the support page reads.
This isn&#x27;t the biggest surprise; Xbox has discussed this release window for Starfield on two occasions before this support page, but it seems the company is really dedicated to getting it out in the coming months. 
While waiting for an official release date, read about why Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield delay is key to its new-gen success and then check out this story about how your Starfield character will not have a voice. Read about how Starfield&#x27;s ambitious scale might be worrisome after that and then read about how Xbox Series X/S first-party games will cost $70 starting this year.

                              <span>Oh. OK. I guess it’s time for me to publicly confess which games I voted for in this year’s advent calendar but that didn&#x27;t get it, and without the usual protection of anonymity granted by group lists. Listen: please don’t judge me. I just want to say that up top before you find out where I live and start sending me pizzas or something. I am fallible. You cut me, I bleed red. I put my bread in the toaster one slice at a time. 


Anyway, with that out the way, here’s a list of things I liked this year that no one else at RPS had a chance to play, or in one case just thought was total ass.

                              <span>I made 12 little games (analog and digital) over the course of my MFA program. However, I dedicated most of that time to my thesis. By graduation, I’d worked as a writer/narrative designer on prototypes, vertical slices, documentation – you name it. And after many adjustments, my thesis even won a highly competitive grant to assist post-grad development! Short deadlines and secondary assignments led to high-stress periods, albeit in a controlled, academic environment, but the lessons about collaboration and creativity were invaluable.
It’s an ordinary school night, and I’m in a video call with my friend Jude. I watch them casually scroll through graffiti-adjacent concept art and brief clips of a passion project called Ponch: Cyberspace Investigator. They give me a rundown of the game’s mechanics, inspirations, and vibe, which includes phrases like “platformer,” “Ace Attorney-inspired dialogue puzzles,” “detective work,” and “hack the internet.” Read more...</span>

                              <span>2023 means a new year, new everything! That includes a renewed hope that I’ll hear more information about a few exciting games that had little to no presence in 2022. Hopefully, with 365 chances to make a splash, one of the following titles from my personal wish list will make a big comeback after spending a year in relative silence. 
  



      
												
DokeV
DokeV feels like the “everything” video game, and it almost looks too good to be true. This delightfully colorful title is, among other things, part MMO, part open-world sandbox, part Pokemon, part Ghostbusters, and part llama-riding simulator. Name something that’s fun, and DokeV probably has it. The project has been in the works for at least a couple of years by Pearl Abyss, best known for its popular MMO, Black Desert Online…</span>

                              <span>In October 2001, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto III – and the entire pop-culture paradigm shifted. It’s hard to say anything about GTA III that hasn’t been said a million times over the last 20 years, but suffice it to say, it laid a blueprint for open-world games so complete that the game industry still largely follows it today.
To celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, we recently talked to Rockstar North art director Aaron Garbut over email about his time working on GTA III, what it meant for Rockstar as a company, and its overall legacy in 2021. Read more...</span>

Lots of time was spent as a lowly tarnished, getting smacked around by big fucken madlads with a dragon for an arm, sure. But I also got lost in a thrilling narrative adventure, laughed at flatulent renditions of our national anthem, swept up loot in Al Mazrah, and became enamoured with a lil gator. Here&#x27;s to 2022, everyone.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

The case is now scheduled for a jury trial....in April 2024.

As we careen into the new year, there are now over 7000 games marked as &quot;playable&quot; or better on Steam Deck.

                              <span>RPS apparently never met a detective game it didn&#x27;t like. There are six on our list of the best games of 2022, for example. If the glowing praise of the team here convinced you to try Chinatown Detective Agency or The Case Of The Golden Idol, then you might want to wait a little while longer before buying them. One of next year&#x27;s genre-specific Steam sales will be the Steam Mystery Fest, running from February 20th-27th.

                              <span>2022 is ready to drop from the calendar, revealing the unblemished pages of 2023 beneath. There&#x27;s a small chance you&#x27;re spending the next several hours at a bacchanalian rager, but I&#x27;d bet that you&#x27;re not. You&#x27;re more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.

That sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven&#x27;t got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you&#x27;re going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you&#x27;re only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.

What are your gaming ambitions for 2023? Tell us in the comments below.

                              <span>As both a parent and the resident news lad here, I probably spend way more time talking and writing about games than getting hundreds of hours to actually play them. While most of the games I&#x27;ve snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.


Possibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.


You guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t play as many games as I wanted to this year - but then I say that every single year and will probably continue to do so until the end of time (I assume at some point my consciousness will be uploaded into an immortal robot that will exist until the heat death of the universe, and that robot will still be doing previews). Like everyone else who has written their selection box, my top picks made it onto the Advent Calendar this year. But some didn&#x27;t! Here are but a three of them.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>Dead Island 2 was announced just a few years after the release of the first Dead Island and a little over a year after Dead Island Riptide – the forgettable and repetitive sequel that did, at least, continue the story of the first game’s survivors. Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. 
The first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …</span>

Until you look around, then, all of a sudden, you can see through time.
I’m standing in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo, Japan, which, if it’s famous for anything, is its crosswalk, Shibuya Crossing, a massive scramble intersection allowing foot traffic to cross in all directions. For lack of a better analogy, you could call it Japan’s Times Square. You’ve seen it in everything about modern Japan ever. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Images of what appears to be a special The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED model have leaked online, but it&#x27;s currently unclear if this is a real console or a believable fake. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that the images of this console appeared on the Famiiboard forum last night from user Kysen. The user didn&#x27;t provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.

As you can see, it appears that this model of the Switch is real. However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there&#x27;s no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn&#x27;t be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year&#x27;s Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. 
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real. In the meantime, check out our list of the biggest 2022 games delayed to 2023.

                              <span>Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn&#x27;t been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). 
While there&#x27;s no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that &quot;2023 will be a year of many announcements,&quot; as reported by Gematsu. 
In this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It&#x27;s here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said &quot;Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,&quot; and that his keyword for 2023 is &quot;long-awaited,&quot; as noted by Gematsu. 
Now, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it&#x27;s Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there&#x27;s reason to believe that maybe he&#x27;s teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we&#x27;re getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series.

                              <span>Game delays are a part of life. You know the old saying, a delayed game is…well, you know. It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.
  



      
												
Arc Raiders
Arc Raiders was set to be the debut title from Embark Studios, a team of ex-DICE talent led by former EA head Patrick Söderlund. The co-op shooter about fighting off robots from space made a splash during last year&#x27;s Game Awards. In a surprising twist, however, Embark announced months later it was delaying Arc Raiders to next year to focus on launching another shooter pro…</span>

But push beyond the Elden Rings and God of War Ragnaröks and you’ll discover a cornucopia of overlooked, underrated gems that run the gamut from text-adventure…

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a weird year at RPS for me. After eight years as news editor, I started the nebulous new role of associate editor. This brought a broad mandate to cover indie games and PC Game Pass and to do, like, whatever else I think might be fun or good. It has been weird to not clock in and just Do News, and to have responsibility only over myself. This freedom has felt great when I&#x27;ve had ideas, and terrible when I&#x27;ve not. I&#x27;m still feeling it out, settling in, and making mistakes, but I&#x27;m quite enjoying myself. Hopefully you have enjoyed some of it too. Here are a few of my favourite things I&#x27;ve written this year!

                              <span>I confess: I usually did my damndest to rig the RPS Advent Calendar vote. When every year has so many more than 24 good games, I always tried to tactically vote and reshuffle points to wedge in a few wee great games I knew not many people had played. But with a change to voting procedure this year, I simply couldn&#x27;t get some games on our list. So, here are the games I would&#x27;ve slammed into our advent calendar if I were still allowed to cheat, along with some that simply didn&#x27;t quite make the cut.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

This non-X variant performs more or less identically, with a slightly low rated boost clock that translates into one or two percent worse performance in CPU-limited scenarios. Given the fact that the 5600 is £13 cheaper on Amazon right now, we&#x27;d recommend it over the X any time.

                              <span>Sabrent&#x27;s Rocket PCIe 4.0 SSD is one of best cheap PCIe 4.0 SSDs that doesn&#x27;t cut corners in terms of NAND type (it&#x27;s TLC, rather than the cheaper QLC) and cache (it&#x27;s got a DRAM cache). This makes it a good performer even in sustained write scenarios, as you might encounter in video editing and the like, while its good random read/write speeds are good for gaming. Sabrent has discounted the drive to £77.99 on Amazon UK, which is a good price for this level of performance.

I cut it down by about half to get what we have here, a collection of interviews and thinky pieces and silly pieces and wonderful pieces from 2022.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I&#x27;ve been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I&#x27;m pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn&#x27;t, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. 
No word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee&#x27;s editing pencil), I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They&#x27;re all absolutely rad).

                              <span>Sequels are often contentious, but I feel like video games can get away with being a part of a long-running series – and, crucially, still be good while they’re at it, well past the point where a book or movie franchise would have outstayed its welcome.
The thing is, though, when it comes to GOTY lists like our Advent Calendar, it’s a much bigger task to convince your fellow voters of the merits of your new favourite game when it’s the third, fourth, or maybe even sixteenth in its series. I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is still on track to release sometime next year, and developer GSC Game World has released its first trailer in six months, showcasing gameplay with some narrative trappings along the edges.
Courtesy of IGN, the new video shows that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is looking pretty darn good. The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. 


Formally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir &quot;Fresh&quot; Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.</span>

                              <span>On February 25, 2022 Valve quietly premiered a trailer for a game called Aperture Desk Job. The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.


As promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.
Aperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game. It features an established Portal character, as well as a new character named Grady, voiced by one of my favorite comedians (and maybe yours after you watch the clip below), Nate Bargatze.

                              <span>Two of the year’s biggest open-world games, Elden Ring and Pokémon Scarlet have been Frankensteined into one tantalizing entity thanks to the work of one talented modder.
The modder in question goes by the handle Arestame, who tweeted a trailer of their handiwork that drops Scarlet assets into the Lands Between. The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn&#x27;t make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush. Check out the video by clicking the embedded tweet below.

It’s unclear if this mod will be publicly available to download or if this video is only a proof-of-concept showcase. We’ve reached out to Arestame for clarification and will update this story if we receive a response.

                              <span>Protecting movies from piracy during their theatrical windows is an industry priority but week in and week out, &#x27;cammed&#x27; copies stubbornly appear online. This summer several unusually good copies were linked to cinemas in the UK, where &#x27;camming&#x27; can result in a prison sentence. Logically, camming should be incredibly rare, but that&#x27;s certainly not the case, far from it.

You might already be familiar with one, and that&#x27;s Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-inspired character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn&#x27;t go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan is great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn&#x27;t get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Ryan, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Dani here)

                              <span>Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project&#x27;s leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.
With the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...</span>

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.
Elden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do. When I chipped away at other games for work or pleasure, tasks like gaining access to Raya Lucaria Academy or conquering Malenia were in the back of my mind.

                              <span>Just in time for the new year, Sony has revealed the next batch of free games coming to PlayStation Plus. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 will be available to download for all tiers of PS Plus starting Tuesday, January 3. PlayStation has not announced the new titles coming to the Extra and Premium tiers, but says that they&#x27;ll be &quot;announced soon.&quot; You can read the full blog post here.
Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a notable inclusion because its sequel, Jedi: Survivor, is set to come out in March. This PS Plus offering is an ideal opportunity for players to check out the first before visiting the second. If you played the game at launch, this is also a chance to check out the updates that introduced upgraded graphics and performance for PS5, as well as updates that added New Journey+ and challenge modes. You can read our original review here.
This is also a friendly reminder to claim December&#x27;s PS Plus titles: Divine Knockout, Biomutant, and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. They&#x27;ll all be available until January 3, the day the new games are added, so be sure to grab them before that.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.
It would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the latest Hollywood blockbusters are no longer available in local cinemas. Not with permission from rightsholders, at least. The Russian cinema business was hit hard by these restrictions but with some tricks and help from &quot;friendly&quot; neighbors, pirated copies of &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot; have found their way onto the big screen.

                              <span>After the FIFA World Cup 2022 got underway early this month, United States law enforcement agencies began seizing live sports streaming domains at an unusually fast rate. Pirate site domain seizures of this type are relatively uncommon, especially against so many targets all at once. Did something make these domains especially vulnerable or are seizures like this the new reality?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking back over an entire year of RPS reviews and, well, we&#x27;ve written a lot. Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn&#x27;t a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we&#x27;ve had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.
Out of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I&#x27;ve gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games. Have a scroll and click on any that take your fancy for the full review. Enjoy!

I feel so honored - and I’m pretty happy with how the GOTY 2022 Calendar turned out, as most of my top choices made it into the roster. However, great games are sure to fall by the wayside in any year - which is why we have our Selection Boxes of honorable mentions this year, right? For my picks I&#x27;ve swept up three quite different games, but I think they come together to give a very Rachel vibe.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>Trombone Champ is a good joke. I played it once, chuckled along with its simulated tooting, and haven&#x27;t felt any compulsion to return. 

I will click on any Trombone Champ video I come across online, however. Armed with some community-made modding tools, creative players have added custom songs to the game, with custom models and backgrounds. At their best, these videos turn a good joke into a complete comedy sketch. And the person making them at their best is Gloomhonk.

                              <span>In late November we saw incredible prices on the Ryzen 7000 series, and now we&#x27;re getting even better deals on many of these processors. The one I&#x27;m highlighting today is the Ryzen 5 7600X, which is down to £249 at Amazon - significantly below its £350 RRP and £21 cheaper than it was for Black Friday.

                              <span>Portable SSDs are a brilliant way to ferry files around, but often they&#x27;re a bit overkill if you&#x27;re just copying a game directory to another PC, bringing a video file to watch on TV or backing up your schoolwork. 
In this case, a fast USB-C flash drive can be just the thing, with the newfangled connection allowing use on a wide range of devices like phones, tablets and games consoles too. Case in point is Samsung&#x27;s 128GB model, which is reduced to £12 today from its usual price of £20.

                              <span>Hello! VidBud Liam here. You may recognise me from those videos that autoplay on every page. Or not. It depends on how quickly you scroll past, I suppose. 


I joined team Arpus all the way back in February, and to say the last 11 months have been a whirlwind is a bit of an understatement. In less than a year I’ve made just under 90 videos covering a wide range of topics from major releases to international gaming events and brand-new hardware. My first year at RPS has been busy, basically. So when Katharine asked me to pull together a few of my personal highlights, I was kind of stumped. It&#x27;s hard to pick favourites! It&#x27;s even harder to celebrate my own achievements, but that&#x27;s beside the point.

                              <span>Don’t look at me, I’m just the hardware guy. But I do recommend looking at these, my favourite also-ran games that weren’t quite team-impressing enough to win a spot on the RPS Advent Calendar 2022. Out of everything I played this year, these are the avatars of adequacy, the sultans of satisfactory. The prime ministers of pretty good. 
I’d probably also tip a hat to Warhammer 40K: Darktide, but Alice0 already nabbed it for her honourable mentions, and frankly there’s enough shootybang stuff here as it is. But, also: toilet build quality testing, pushing Nazis into cement pits, and more than a hint of 70s funk. Check ‘em out.

So without ado: here&#x27;s a handful of the games I enjoyed the most this year which (crushingly) didn&#x27;t quite make their way into our soft &#x27;n&#x27; snuggly RPS Advent Calendar 2022.

                              <span>A little known fact is that all of the RPS staff are complex clockwork automata, designed and built by a little gnome with the kind of inch-thick glasses that make your eyes look comically large. We&#x27;re each powered by a spell that lasts but 12 months, so every Christmas we fall over like sad marionettes. The gnome has to spend a couple of weeks trekking up a mountain to see the fairy who can recast the spells on us. You can help fund his sled dogs and provisions by becoming a member of the RPS supporter program. While he&#x27;s away, we&#x27;ve prepared some Christmas Crackers for you.
Time to enjoy your lovely joke!

                              <span>2022 brought us a number of rich narratives in games. While heavy hitters like God of War: Ragnarok, Elden Ring, or Destiny 2’s The Witch Queen expansion are likely to have their praises sung the loudest, there were also games like Obsidians’ Pentiment that are equally deserving of our attention.

                              <span>I am, admittedly, new to the world of Final Fantasy VII. I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.
All of that is to say my understanding of the world of Final Fantasy VII i…</span>

                              <span>If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.
Arcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Microsoft’s road to acquire Activision Blizzard has been a rocky one, to say the least. The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. 
The full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen.

                              <span>The story of Cuphead is indie gaming legend. Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.
With Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Dead Island 2 will feature six playable survivors right from the jump. You might already be familiar with one, and that&#x27;s Jacob, the Lenny Kravitz-esque character featured in the re-reveal trailer for Dead Island 2. During my cover story trip, I played roughly seven hours of Dead Island 2, but I didn&#x27;t go hands-on with Jacob. I did, however, play a few hours with both Dani and Ryan, two very different survivors that add their own flair to the story of this zomb-pocalypse. 
I came out of this cover story trip convinced Dani is the survivor for me, but Ryan was great, too. And there are still the other four survivors I didn&#x27;t get to play. Nonetheless, I want to tell you about Dani, and Dambuster Studios does, too (read about Ryan here).

                              <span>Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.
But even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Nier: Automata is coming to the small screen. Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.
You can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: 


From the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. 
The series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who&#x27;s previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.
NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it&#x27;s not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.</span>

                              <span>Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don&#x27;t talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren&#x27;t very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, &quot;Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!&quot;. The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like &quot;Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?&quot; (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).
Because we operate so much behind the scenes, it&#x27;s easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain&#x27;t easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that&#x27;s useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I&#x27;d love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we&#x27;re most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!

                              <span>The Radeon RX 6700 XT is an excellent 1440p graphics card, offering strong rasterised performance, a good image upscaler in FSR 2 and relatively cool and quiet operation. The card is much stronger pound for pound than its closest Nvidia competition, the RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070, with the latter remaining at surprisingly high prices due to the ultrapremium RTX 4080 and 4090 Team Green has launched so far. 
Today, the best price we&#x27;ve spotted for the RX 6700 XT is for a Gigabyte Eagle model, selling on Amazon UK for £389.99. That&#x27;s nearly 40% below its RRP and an overall great value for this level of performance.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost time. In a few short hours, we will open the final door of the RPS advent calendar and reveal our favourite game of 2022. Oh, and we&#x27;re all off work until the new year, bye. RPS won&#x27;t be barren, mind. We have quite a few bonus festive treats lined up between now and our official return on Tuesday the 3rd of January, 2023, so enjoy those (or enjoy the ones you can; the cracker jokes are... painful). Thanks for reading RPS for another year. Before we go, please do tell us what you&#x27;re playing this holiday. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

He&#x27;s one of several Christmas treats now stocked on the streets of Los Santos, which also pack snowmen to destroy, rooftop shootouts and, for some reason, superpowered beasts getting chased by serial killers.

While we settle down into our mountain of games, sweet wrappers and warm blankets for a couple of weeks, we wish you a merry Christmas, a happy holiday and a general Festivus to all who celebrate. The site won&#x27;t be completely silent during the break - we&#x27;ve got a couple of fun things planned for you over the next week and a bit - but we&#x27;ll be back in full bright and early on Tuesday, January 3rd 2023.

                              <span>Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima has claimed his upcoming Death Stranding movie is &quot;taking a direction that nobody has tried before with a movie adaptation of a game&quot;, arguing that other attempts to wring movies out of game-ies have failed because they &quot;cater to gamers&quot;. His will be different, he says, because he&#x27;s &quot;taking the approach of changing and evolving the world of Death Stranding in a way that suits film well&quot;.
He also says there&#x27;s &quot;no real need&quot; to turn games into films, which is a true and enjoyable acknowledgement from someone who is doing that.

                              <span>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit is a playable teaser released to promote Life Is Strange 2, the first episode of which followed on three months after this surprise p.t. dropped during E3 2018. Not to be confused with Silent Hills P.T. (it&#x27;s like… the exact opposite of that), Captain Spirit is free to play, takes two to three hours to complete, and manages to perfectly encapsulate the Life Is Strange experience without giving anything away about the main (read: paid-for) games in the series. It also features possibly my favourite LIS protagonist in adorable wannabe superhero Chris, which is quite a high bar to clear, considering how much time I spend banging on about what great characters Chloe and Sean are.

                              <span>Legendarily complicated (and just generally legendary) colony sim Dwarf Fortress launched on Steam a few weeks ago, bringing sprite graphics, more players and millions of dollars for developers Bay 12 games. Brothers Tarn and Zach Adams have spent the past 16 years relying on donations, so actually selling their game has now allowed to expand their team and hire someone from their community to help with the programming. They say &quot;Putnam&quot; will be the first non-Adam to ever see the code behind the curtain. Cue the Indiana Jones face-melting gif.
An update yesterday also added Steam trading cards, as well as giving you the option to flick between classic and premium graphics.

                              <span>I find myself alone. I am the only person left in the treehouse right now. I think it&#x27;s the first time this has happened. It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don&#x27;t particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin&#x27;?
This gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I&#x27;ve had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I&#x27;m live and uncensored, baby. I&#x27;m going to fire up Among Trees. Let&#x27;s go and be alone together. But don&#x27;t worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I&#x27;ll make sure the final word is a joke.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a well known fact that there are &quot;Too Many Games&quot;(TM) these days. I have not done the maths, but I&#x27;ve seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don&#x27;t try our hardest all the same. 
Inevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, &quot;I&#x27;M SORRY, I DIDN&#x27;T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!&quot; (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don&#x27;t hate me)

                              <span>Serious racing games are not, as a rule, my thing. If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.
Rush Rally 3 isn&#x27;t all that serious, but it&#x27;s still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.

                              <span>Last week I spoke to Larian&#x27;s founder and director Swen Vincke about the latest big update to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and the road to 1.0 release. But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D&#x27;you see what I did there?
My questions are in bold, and Vincke&#x27;s answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive. I for one hope that Wyll&#x27;s romcom visit home becomes a future winter DLC.

                              <span>December always feels like a good month for VR gaming. Perhaps it&#x27;s because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I&#x27;m likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you&#x27;re giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I&#x27;ll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.


First though, it&#x27;s time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol&#x27; shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I&#x27;d probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.

                              <span>Publisher Deep Silver revealed Dead Island 2 in 2014 and Los Angeles was its primary setting (with a tease in the game’s logo that San Francisco might be in it as well). Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? 
I traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that&#x27;s been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer.

                              <span>Sports Story is available now, Nintendo and developer SideBar Games announced during a special Inside the House of Indies holiday video. The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.
Golf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don&#x27;t worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. 
You can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust &amp; Neon, below.


Golf Story, SideBar Games&#x27; predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it &quot;a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,&quot; awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month&#x27;s Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.
Sports Story is available now for Switch.</span>

                              <span>The Gran Turismo series has long been a favorite of sim-racing enthusiasts, and today marks a special milestone for the franchise. Gran Turismo: The Real Driving Simulator was released on PlayStation in Japan on December 23, 1997, meaning that the series has officially crossed the quarter-century mark. To celebrate 25 years of Gran Turismo, PlayStation released a special blog post and a retrospective video.
The blog post comes by way of Kazunori Yamauchi, creator and producer of the franchise and CEO of Polyphony Digital. In the post, Yamauchi recounts how the series came to be, with his original plans for the series stretching as far back as 1992.

                              <span>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games are bringing a custom arcade mode, new filters, and more to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. 
This news comes by way of a Steam blog post for the game that reveals this new update is available to download right now. It includes a new custom arcade mode, CRT and VCR filters, and additional fixes and changes to the game. 


&quot;The update implements Custom Game options, granting ninjas greater control over their tubular battle against the Foot Clan through 11 mix-and-match modifiers reminiscent of the dip switches found on old school arcade machines,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Retro-themed filters and an extra large serving of refinements round out the surprise update, which reaches PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox players today.&quot; 
Here is a look at the Custom Game options dip switch board: 
As you can see, it looks like there&#x27;s plenty to mix and match to make each custom arcade session feel unique. If you&#x27;re interested, be sure to boot the game up today and get the update downloading.

                              <span>Santa Monica Studio has announced that God of War Ragnarök, which hit PlayStation consoles last month, is getting a New Game Plus mode in spring. 
This news comes by way of a short and sweet tweet posted today by the studio that says Spring 2023 is when fans can expect the feature to hit Ragnarök. As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it&#x27;ll &quot;share more details once we get closer to the release.&quot; 


While many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game&#x27;s release isn&#x27;t surprising. God of War (2018) received its New Game Plus mode after launch as well. For now, we wait until next spring. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s God of War Ragnarök review and then read about how the game&#x27;s director fought to keep its most unexpected and cartoonish character in the game. Check out this story about how Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge originally quit when he learned someone else was directing Ragnarök after that and then read about how Amazon Prime Video has ordered a God of War TV series set during the Norse era.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Episode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle
Episode 2- When Doves Cry
Episode 3 - Bible.
Episode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair


In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>Ubisoft stopped releasing their games via Steam back in 2019, starting with The Division 2. The Tom Clancy shoot-to-looter was instead released via Ubisoft&#x27;s own digital storefront and via the Epic Games Store. It&#x27;ll finally arrive on Steam next month on January 12th, as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s broader shift back to Valve&#x27;s storefront.

It seemingly already has the scope of the 16-bit games that inspired it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t post-release updates to come. Its developer is now working on a New Game Plus mode.

By contrast, Sail Forth looks more my speed, with its enormous sea creatures, secretive faction of frogs in submarines, and a wind system itd developers claim is &quot;deeply accessible&quot;. It&#x27;s out now and there&#x27;s a launch trailer below.

                              <span>Nope, you don&#x27;t need to get your eyes tested. Alt254 is a minimalist action adventure game that plays out on a small (albeit greatly enlarged) map that measures just 21x26 pixels. In this tiny space, you, a black dot, must venture forth, solving puzzles, deciphering the strange, colourful world around you and piecing together your broken memory along the way. It&#x27;s a very enigmatic little game, but one that&#x27;s instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.

                              <span>Yesterday, I used my amazing arithmetical reasoning abilities to surmise that there were only eight free games left to come from the Epic Games Store’s Winter Sale giveaway. I was wrong. Don’t look shocked, it happens. Today sees three of the earliest Fallout games being offered up for nothing. They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.

Well, Ubisoft and Capcom have teamed up to make the lives of digital peasants even harder, by shoving some Monster Hunter World themed gubbins into Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. Have a watch of the trailer below to see just how bizarre this crossover is.

                              <span>Tradition is a transformative power. Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event&#x27;s core, and that doesn&#x27;t matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED have pushed out another hotfix for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s ever-so-slightly borked next-gen update that was released last week. You can expect some extra stability compared to the previous version of the update, something that’ll always be welcome on my PC. Along with Roach’s early Christmas present of some stabilisers, the hotfix also tackles the annoying bug that caused toxicity to be stuck at max level, along with some minor tweaks to photo mode, and unexplained improvements for The Witcher 3’s performance on Steam Deck.

As far as I can tell, their Sphynx Ampere toiletries do not smell like new graphics cards, so who cares? However! This does make me wonder: which PC gaming smells would you like as a shower gel, perfume, deodorant, aftershave, air freshener, or such? What are the good smells of PC gaming? Which would you eagerly accept as a boxed toiletry set from your aunt this Christmas? I&#x27;ll go first.

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.
