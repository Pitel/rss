The Sensor Bar. Flimsy little plastic box with the world&#x27;s longest, spindliest cable. An irritation to every Wii owner who has ever had to move their console. What was it good for?
There&#x27;s not a lot to the Sensor Bar. A little device that emits some infrared light. If the Wii Remote is pointed at one, it recognises that&#x27;s where the TV is. It&#x27;s not high-tech. Famously, its functionality can be replicated by two candles. Cheap, cheerful, reliable.

                              <span>A test of patients.
The past few years have reminded us that many countries’ healthcare systems are not in good shape. Even so, it’s hard to appreciate the challenges that healthcare workers face if you’re not one. Fall of Porcupine aims to do this in an approachable way by putting players in the scrubs of 2D animal doctors. Unfortunately, the latest release from Critical Rabbit isn’t the hard-hitting medical drama wrapped in a fuzzy waffle blanket that we would’ve liked. This cute game has so much potential, but it needed more care and a focused narrative to really soar.
An impressive amount of research and interviews have gone into the game’s much-needed commentary – everything from full beds to alternative medicine to corporate hospital management. It’s a shame all that research results in a flatline story with repetitive mechanics. You control Finley, an anthropomorphised pigeon and the newest doctor at St. Ursula&#x27;s Hospital in the town of Porcupine. As you tend to patients, your boss, white cheetah Dr Krokowski, is constantly less than impressed with you. There’s also a fellow newbie doctor, a suspicious janitor, a chief physician, and MANY more characters who take the form of various animals.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer says it&#x27;s &quot;incorrect&quot;.
Microsoft is currently locked in a courtroom battle with the Federal Trade Commission over its proposed $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and although the focus is mostly on Xbox, on day two of the proceedings, the Nintendo Switch has already been dragged into the fight.
According to The Verge, the FTC has been attempting to argue the Switch is &quot;very different&quot; to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - suggesting it&#x27;s not really part of the same market by comparing its technical capabilities, with lines about its frame rate and how it compares in terms of GPU teraflops.

Sega gave blue blur fans another look at the upcoming release Sonic Superstars at its recent Sonic Central broadcast, but one thing it didn&#x27;t lock in was a release date.
It&#x27;s due to arrive at some point in Fall 2023 and there&#x27;s now apparently been &quot;multiple retailer listings&quot; for Sonic Superstars - suggesting the game will be released on 17th October. This specific date can be found on websites like Target and GameStop in the US, with the price locked at $59.99.

One of the third-party highlights of the latest Nintendo Direct earlier this week was the announcement Batman: Arkham Trilogy would be coming to the Switch this Fall.
As exciting as it is, some new information about the physical version has now surfaced. The Switch version&#x27;s FAQ has revealed the hard copy will only include Batman Arkham Asylum on the game card, with the other two titles (Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight) requiring a download:

I&#x27;m in the UK for a few days and long for my new/current homeland, where it is also very hot but at least the biscuits and chicken fillet rolls are very good. Still, this weekend I might get a walk-in tattoo and eat some eggy bread, which I am told adults refer to as French toast. I tell you what I probably won&#x27;t be doing though: playing some video games! I&#x27;m away from home and didn&#x27;t bring any portables with me. Luckily the rest of the team can make up for me.

                              <span>As Steam Next Fests go, I think the one this June has easily been one of the best Next Fests in a little while. Seeing all the great demos this week has made me far more excited about the future of video games than any of the notE3 streams did the other week, and I&#x27;m not gonna lie, a large part of my excitement stems from the brilliant Let&#x27;s! Revolution!, a beautifully animated tile-based roguelite that has a touch of Minesweeper about it. I highlighted it in our big demo rec list at the start of the week, but 150-odd words simply wasn&#x27;t enough to really get across just how excellent this is. So indulge me a bit while I tell you more about it.

                              <span>You know when the look of a game instantly captures your attention, and then you play a demo for it and it&#x27;s even better? That&#x27;s the journey I&#x27;ve been on with deckbuilding RPG Cross Blitz this week. I first heard about it last month back when word hit that it was coming to early access this year, and I was instantly taken with its chunky animal character sprites. There was something a bit Advance Wars about the look and style about its burly lion pirate captain, but just, you know, in a high seas card battle kind of setting instead of dealing with sergeants, tanks and air support. But its Steam Next Fest demo has really sunk its teeth into me this week, offering up turn-based card duels that scratch exactly the same kind of itch as Inscryption did for me a couple of years ago.

                              <span>I am having an absolute riot playing Killer Frequency. It’s a first-person puzzle horror where you&#x27;re trying to help folks escape a rampaging murderer. Usually, when I read a game description like that, I’m already grabbing my cushion to hide behind and readying my cute puppy compilation video on a second screen, but Team17 have heavily leaned into the campy side of slasher horror with humour serving as the perfect buffer. No safety cushion or puppies needed here, folks. 
Here’s the set-up: You’re playing as Forrest Nash, a big-time radio DJ who has found himself stuck in Small Town, Nowhere, USA. While you&#x27;re working as the host for the town’s local station, it turns out the police chief has only gone and gotten themselves stabbed by a serial killer. With them out of action, you’re roped into acting as a stand-in 911 operator - and with the murderer still on the loose and ready to strike again, that line is going to be pretty busy.

                              <span>Yesterday marked the first day of proceedings in the legal battle between Microsoft and the US Federal Trade Commission as the FTC seeks a preliminary injunction on Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. The injunction would further prevent Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition deal of Activision Blizzard from going through. 

Several of Xbox&#x27;s high profile figures testified at the first day of trial, including the likes of Sarah Bond, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships and business development at Microsoft, Bethesda head of publishing Pete Hines, and Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. They were questioned on a range of things including cloud gaming, Call Of Duty exclusivity, and Bobby Kotick&#x27;s revenue share demands.

                              <span>There are a bunch of reasons I like The Tartarus Key (enough to make it our RPS Game Club pick this month), and one of them is that it&#x27;s not actually scary. Like, sure, you could attach the horror tag to it on Steam if you wanted, but it&#x27;s more of a costume for you to enjoy - like the family down the street who are really into Halloween and turn their suburban semi into a haunted house with a movie-quality zombie in the front yard. It&#x27;s really cool and you like it on its own terms, but being frightened isn&#x27;t so much the point as it is to remember you have enjoyed being frightened in the past. Also, for some reason the family won&#x27;t let you out of the living room until you complete a logic puzzle involving maths.

                              <span>&quot;Will it or won&#x27;t it?&quot; has been the big question. That is, will Final Fantasy 16 actually be released on PC or won&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s been emotional whiplash for some PC fans. A PC version was specified in the game&#x27;s announcement trailer, and then FF16 producer Yoshi-P walked it back and said that didn&#x27;t happen, and then Yoshi-P addressed his previous words and said he&#x27;d like to bring the game to PC eventually. Just don&#x27;t expect it within six months. Or before 2024, actually.

Not content with dropping an HD port of the original Pikmin during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, the platform holder also saw fit to furnish us with this slightly revamped version of its sequel, the very excellent Pikmin 2. Hooray!
Yes, Nintendo has planted us firmly in the Pikmin 4 hype zone prior to that game&#x27;s launch and, if you&#x27;ve yet to play this 2004 GameCube gem, you&#x27;re in for a great big treat. Pikmin 2 takes the wonderfully unique and inventive foundations of its timeless predecessor and gently adds more variety to the mix, resulting in a game that&#x27;s arguably the pik (we are so clever) of this franchise thus far.

The June 2023 Nintendo Direct showcase gave us a lot to look forward to over the next year on Switch, but the star of the show had to be the reveal of a brand new 2D Mario game, Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Thoughts after our first viewing of the trailer were mainly dominated by the elephant in the room — we mean the literal elephant — but we soon managed to pull ourselves together and begin to take in some of the other, hidden features.

The appearance doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than an aesthetic change, but the visuals retain all the subtle nuances that have been showcased in the Sonic the Hedghog Lego sets.

It’s been a bit of a barren six years or thereabouts for Switch-owning Tomb Raider fans, without so much as a remastered golden oldie or even (mercifully, perhaps) a quickie cloud version of one of the new-fangled reboots to enjoy on Nintendo’s platform. However, all of that is just about to change with the imminent arrival of The Lara Croft Collection, which hits the eShop on the 29th June.
Not to be confused with The Tomb Raider Collection, which gave lucky PC players a massive 13 games from across this hallowed franchise to dig into, this much slighter package comes courtesy of Feral Interactive (Alien Isolation, GRID Autosport) and contains 2010’s Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and its follow-up, 2014’s Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris. On the one hand, it’s perhaps a little disappointing that we don’t get to have any of the old Tomb Raider classics involved here but, on the other, what we are getting is two surprisingly great isometric spin-offs from the mains series that do a fantastic job of delivering the thrills and spills of the franchise proper in a portable-friendly form.

Nintendo has launched an official Japanese website for Everybody 1-2-Switch, and recently, it&#x27;s been updated to include clips of all 17 minigames that will feature (thanks, GoNintendo!).

Nintendo gave Pikmin fans a couple of lovely surprises during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, prepping players for Pikmin 4&#x27;s debut by stealth-dropping the original Pikmin and its wonderful sequel in HD remastered form. Exciting!
Yes, if you&#x27;ve played these two beauties before, you&#x27;ll know they&#x27;re among some of Nintendo&#x27;s loveliest work, and digging into the 2001 original here reveals a game that&#x27;s stood the test of time remarkably well. Pikmin 1 is still a joyous, playful, cute and colourful adventure to undertake and, although this HD remaster isn&#x27;t quite up to the standards we&#x27;d expect from the Big N — and nowhere near the level of remaster we got with the recent Metroid Prime Remastered — it&#x27;s still a must-play in our book, especially if you&#x27;ve yet to sample the delights of this GameCube classic.

Imagine saving up money to buy shares so you can attend a shareholder meeting with the company president and complain about something in a video game. That&#x27;s exactly what one Splatoon 3 fan has reportedly done. GLHF reports that a Splatoon 3 player saved up enough cash to attend a recent Nintendo shareholder meeting simply to complain about an apparent lack of poses for male inklings and octolings in the ink-based team shooter.
The attendee reportedly held up the meeting for a while with their complaints, stating that Nintendo has &quot;given boys the cold shoulder&quot; (as translated by GLHF&#x27;s Georgina Young), accusing the Big N of favouring the female characters. They&#x27;ve previously written to Nintendo about their concerns before, but claim to have been ignored as things &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to improve&quot;.

We are now heading into the final lap of Mario Kart Tour&#x27;s &#x27;Mario vs. Luigi Tour&#x27; and that means that it is time for us to see what&#x27;s up next.
As shared today via the @mariokarttourEN Twitter, we got our first look at the &#x27;Night Tour&#x27;, which is set to see Wii Moonview Highway speeding into the game along with a brand new city circuit, Rome Avanti. This circuit will see you driving through the Italian capital, navigating quaint streets and drifting around the Colosseum — might we see this one come to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe soon?

This review originally went live in 2015, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack GBA library.

Before Fire Emblem: Awakening kicked off 2013 (the Year of Luigi, you&#x27;ll recall) with a bang, there was a great deal of concern at Nintendo regarding its future viability as a franchise. Sales were at an all-time low, and series producer Hitoshi Yamagami was given an ultimatum: at least 250,000 copies of the latest entry needed to be sold in order to ensure the franchise had a future. Of course, we know now that the 3DS masterpiece went on to sell more copies in the US than any other series entry at the time, bringing the game to a bigger audience than ever before and cementing the Fire Emblem brand&#x27;s value.

Here at Nintendo Life, you will regularly catch us getting envious of region-exclusive game merchandise, and such envy has hit us today as we got a first look at the range of Pikmin 4 homewares that will soon be coming to FamilyMart stores in Japan as well as the Nintendo stores in Tokyo and Osaka.
Shared via a blog post on the official Nintendo Japan site, the collection will be released in three waves over the next month beginning on 4th July. There are a lot of awesome-looking products available from notebooks to handbags, and we thought that we would share some snaps of our favourites with you below so that we can be united in our envy.

Back in 2019, a Kickstarter was launched for a &quot;magical&quot; 2D platformer known as Enchanted Portals. It was accused at the time of being a Cuphead clone, and although there were a few things to overcome along the way, it hasn&#x27;t stopped developer Xixo from seeing out the project.
In an update, the studio has now officially confirmed it will be coming to the Nintendo Switch this summer. This cartoon-like adventure, which supports two-player co-op, sees a pair of &quot;rookie magicians&quot; stuck between dimensions as they journey through a variety of enchanting worlds in an attempt to &quot;reclaim the Magic Book&quot;.

                              <span>Ve středu vyšlo Go 1.21 RC2. V RC1 se totiž objevila chyba, ta byla opravena a vydáno bylo hned RC2. Mezi hlavní změny patří PGO (profile based optimization). To už bylo k testování v Go 1.20, ale v 1.21 již bude k ostrému nasazení. Stačí mít v hlavním adresáři soubor default.pgo a PGO bude použito. Očekává se zrychlení 2–7 %. Vlastní Go 1.21 je také kompilováno s PGO a kompiluje o 2–4 % rychleji (záleží na architektuře).</span>

                              <span>Evening Star, a new studio made up of the team that made Sonic Mania, have announced their first game, Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway. While Sonic Mania was a 2D platformer, the studio&#x27;s first game under their new name brings them into the realm of 3D, taking an incredibly vibrant colour palette that would certainly work in any classic Sonic game, and marrying it a world that one could say is mildly reminiscent of the hedgehog&#x27;s rival Mario.

                              <span>When Alice Bee selected thriller-puzzler The Tartarus Key as this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club pick, I naively signed up for it thinking I&#x27;d be fine tackling a game where most puzzles can&#x27;t be solved with a few trigger pulls. So, I did the smart thing and roped in my pal Ed. Yes, my pal is also called Ed, so parts of this post sound like I&#x27;m referring to myself in the third-person. This isn&#x27;t the case, but if you&#x27;d like to imagine that I, in fact, solved the puzzles myself, then please feel free to do so.

                              <span>While the bug-squishing autoshooter is itself still in the larva stage, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor already looks like a worthwhile Vampire Survivors-like. It apparently helps to crib the mining, mineral hoarding, and maladroit approach to industrial safety that makes source material Deep Rock Galactic one of the best FPS games going.
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is in the works at Funday Games, not original DRG devs and fellow Danish outfit Ghost Ship Games. But it does fall under the latter’s new publishing arm, Ghost Ship Publishing, and can trace its origins back to a casual meeting between Funday co-founder Anders Leicht Rohde and Ghost Ship CEO Søren Lundgaard – and beyond.

                              <span>EA are cutting themselves down the middle, with EA Games and EA Sports now making up two separate units, and the former getting a rebrand. From now on, EA Games will be known as EA Entertainment, which really doesn&#x27;t have as good a ring to it (no one&#x27;s going to be quoting &quot;it&#x27;s in the entertainment,&quot; any time soon are they?). The name change does imply a broader expansion into more than just games, but it&#x27;s obviously a bit of a wait and see kind of situation until EA show off something that isn&#x27;t a video game.

                              <span>Shown off at this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest showcase, Sand Land is an upcoming RPG from the folks over at Ilca Inc, the developers of One Piece Odyssey, and the creator of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama. It&#x27;s an adaptation on one of Toriyama&#x27;s lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who&#x27;s hogged the desert&#x27;s vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people&#x27;s attention.

As reported by The Verge, come July 6th, Xbox Game Pass will be going up from £8/ $9 a month to £9/ $11, and Game Pass Ultimate will increase from £11/ $15 a month to £13/ $17. If you&#x27;re just a PC player though, you&#x27;ve got nothing to worry about, as Microsoft hasn&#x27;t announced any changes for PC Game Pass at this point in time.

The official Sims Twitter account did show a short teaser trailer earlier this week of a Sim imagining a life out in the desert, promising a &quot;rootin&#x27; tootin&#x27; expansion, two bold kits,&quot; and a Behind the Sims presentation. You can check out the full trailer for that when it debuts later today, but leaks regarding the expansion were shared on the Sims Community fan site after details and screenshots were mistakenly shared on Steam earlier this week.

                              <span>Valve&#x27;s Index remains one of the very best PC VR headsets for playing games like Half-Life Alyx, Beat Saber or Star Trek: Bridge Crew, but it does cost a fair amount - $999 for the full kit in the US, for example. However, it is possible to get used/refurbished models for much cheaper, including at GameStop where you can now pick up the full kit for just $599, a solid $400 off the usual price.

                              <span>Microsoft has done a great job making some truly inventive special edition Xbox Series controllers, and their latest effort is one that uses the &#x27;NASA-punk&#x27; aesthetics of upcoming big budget Bethesda RPG Starfield. The controller looks phenomenal, but it does cost a fair bit - so I thought it was worth letting you know that the early adopter tax has been lifted, and the controller is now down to £65. 
That&#x27;s still fairly expensive, but given that this controller seems destined to sell out - as it has done in the US - then I thought it was worth bringing up regardless.

                              <span>The world of Diablo 4 is full of misery and sadness. There are flayed corpses everywhere, fathers are haunted by the ghosts of their dead sons, blokes cram flaming eyeballs into their skulls and sometimes a guy turns up at random just to stomp you (and a lot of other people) into fleshy jam on the ground. Given all the abject suffering that the game and its predecessors make their stock and trade, it was an especially nice surprise to see real, genuine positivity emerge out of the literal hellscape of Sanctuary.

That makes it a cheaper alternative to their PCIe 4.0 drives with DRAM, but still more than fast enough for PC gaming. Therefore, it&#x27;s worth knowing that the 1TB 980 is now available for less than £40 at Amazon, a £16 reduction from its usual price and less than half the cost it debuted at back in 2021.

                              <span>&quot;Olivia, get the bowls and chopsticks ready to eat dinner,&quot; my mum asks 10 year old me. I do as I&#x27;m told, taking them to the dinner table. In childish, whimsical fashion as a childish, whimsical child, I grab my pair of chopsticks and start hitting them together as if I&#x27;m a drummer. &quot;Olivia, don&#x27;t do that,&quot; my mum scolds me. &quot;Your grandma always used to tell me off when I did that as a child.&quot; Sullenly, I put the chopsticks back down on the table.

Well, 10 year old me, you&#x27;re in for a treat. If you wait a couple of decades, you&#x27;ll learn of Nour: Play With Your Food, a game which allows you to bang together chopsticks. The game wants you to. Nour is a physics simulation of a variety of foods, where you can choose the ingredients for the dish and add various &quot;effects&quot; of a non-culinary nature.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no secret that I love Dorfromantik. It opened my eyes to the world of tile-based puzzler strategy games, and I&#x27;ve looked out for similar ones ever since. Thankfully for me, there&#x27;s been a fair few riffs on Dorformantik&#x27;s formula recently - a focus on nature, a soothing soundtrack, and some good old puzzling. Growth is one of these, and I&#x27;m hooked on the demo that&#x27;s playable as part of Steam Next Fest. Taking place on a hexagonal grid, the aim is to uncover the map using a range of wildlife, fertilising the land in the process. Each tile you reveal gives you points, and you&#x27;ll have to navigate around mountains, water, and special landmarks.

                              <span>Roblox is launching new regulation in order to allow creators to make content specifically for users aged 17 and above. From what Manuel Bronstein, Roblox&#x27;s Chief Product Officer, shared in an official blog post yesterday, it seems that it&#x27;ll be on creators to label their experiences as mature, which &quot;may contain more violence, blood, or crude humour&quot; than usual experiences.
The introduction of age appropriate access is not for safety primarily, as Roblox say they want to &quot;simulate and even go beyond what&#x27;s possible in the real world&quot;. Bronstein also added that, &quot;We want to replicate that dynamic on Roblox,&quot; referring to the idea of getting older and legally being allowed to enter places such as nightclubs.

                              <span>Stop me if you&#x27;ve heard this one before: the RTX 4060 Ti just came out but you should probably buy the RTX 3060 Ti instead. It&#x27;s around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. 
We&#x27;ve highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here&#x27;s one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE.

                              <span>Good news, everyone! AMD&#x27;s fastest graphics card is now available for less money, in what deals scientists are calling a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;limited time promotion&quot;. According to the latest research, this phenomena can be observed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically the UK and the US, with discounts applied on both sides. This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. 
The specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire&#x27;s AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required).

I can tell that Immortals Of Aveum has been delayed. Aveum had been aiming for a July 20th release, but has now been pushed back a month until August 22nd.

                              <span>I’ve been meaning to round up the best Steam Deck accessories for a while now – ambushing Liam with homemade Etsy gadgets is one thing but now that there are literally millions of Decks in owners’ hands, quite literally, it’s time to put a serious face on and consider which accessories genuinely are the best buys.
This guide is keeping separate from the best Steam Deck microSD card list, mainly because a good microSD card is less of an accessory and more of a core essential (especially if you’ve gone for the 64GB Steam Deck model). Still, this guide will cover an array of addons, from alternative cases to thumbstick covers and USB-C docking stations.

                              <span>El Paso, Elsewhere, the Max Payne inspired shooter where you fight werewolves and vampires in a reality-shifting motel, has a demo now, and it&#x27;s looking pretty promising so far. It&#x27;s the next title on the docket for developer Strange Scaffold, a team whose projects just constantly have strong hooks (how good is An Airport For Aliens Currently Run By Dogs as a title though). El Paso, Elsewhere is no different, and you can even try it out now as part of this season&#x27;s Steam Next Fest in a new demo. And yeah, the vibes are about as tight as you&#x27;d expect.

                              <span>My Dad likes to tell this story from when I was a teenager. I had grumpily asked if he could pick me and a friend up from a local park one afternoon, and he remembers us bundling into the back of his car all smelly and sweaty and terrible as teenagers so often are. But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it&#x27;s the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.


My poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.

Entitled Final Transmission, a short teaser trailer has been released giving us a look at what protagonist Jacob Lee will be getting up to, but it doesn&#x27;t really show us all that much. There seems to be some kind of fleshy robot monster that says he&#x27;ll &quot;never escape,&quot; but that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve got to go off right now.

                              <span>The upcoming expansion pack for Sonic Origins (aptly named Sonic Origins Plus) appears to be out in the wild early ahead of its launch on June 23rd, but fans don&#x27;t seem to be particularly happy with the game&#x27;s sound quality. The Plus expansion will bring remastered visuals, bonus characters, new modes and challenges to the original Sonic Origins compilation, but it&#x27;s the audio quality of the 12 new Sonic Game Gear additions that fans seem to have taken issue with. As spotted by TheGamer, fans who have got their hands on copies of the game early, such as YouTuber belmont gr, are reporting that the Game Gear games sound off, like there&#x27;s some kind of echo effect.

Playable for free in your browser, it&#x27;s titled Blood in Baldur&#x27;s Gate, and is set 15 years before the events of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Developer Larian Studios revealed the project yesterday. In it, you play as a detective tasked with solving a murder, and by you, I quite literally mean all of you, as this one will take a bit of collaboration.

                              <span>I really like escape rooms IRL, and have a tremendous amount of respect for the people who devise them. But seeing as how they last about an hour and cost approximately the same as it would for Wales to secede from the United Kingdom, I can only afford to pay an immersive experience what it deserves every so often (the rest of the time I&#x27;m honourbound by my fatherland to donate to causes supported by Michael Sheen). I&#x27;m therefore pleased that there seems to be an uptick in escape room video games. Plese do more of those, developers.

                              <span>Operační systém Tails zavádí v nové verzi 5.14 automatickou migraci na LUKS2 a Argon2id. Důvodem je, že dosud používané šifrování LUKS v Tailsu 5.12 či starších verzích je nedostatečné proti získání přístupu k datům ze strany státní moci držící fyzicky daný počítač / notebook. Tails 5.14 tedy automaticky převede persistentní úložiště na LUKS2 s Argon2id.</span>

                              <span>Pořadatelé konference OpenAlt spustili registraci přednášek a hledají přednášející pro letošní ročník. Ten se uskuteční druhý týden v listopadu, tedy 11. a 12. listopadu 2023 na brněnské Fakultě informatiky Masarykovy univerzity. OpenAlt je fórem, kde se každoročně sdružují lidé, kteří se zajímají o vývoj a používání svobodného a otevřeného softwaru a hardwaru. Otevřený přístup nejen umožňuje opravitelnost a rozšiřitelnost zařízení, ale také poskytuje možnost auditovat zdrojový kód, což přináší vysokou úroveň zabezpečení a soukromí, vysvětluje za organizátory Jozef JoeJoe Mlích.</span>

                              <span>Next month&#x27;s open beta for Frontier Developments&#x27; new Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin may be focused on testing its 1v1 multiplayer mode, but the Elite Dangerous studio have told me there&#x27;s still plenty to look forward to in its single-player story campaign. I got to chat with principal designer Sandro Sammarco last week, and he told me they&#x27;ve been hard at work making sure it&#x27;s &quot;filled with loads of cool new stuff that people really haven&#x27;t seen before&quot;. He also said that their partnership with Games Workshop has allowed them to &quot;really go to town in terms of the visuals, the lore, [and] the story that we&#x27;re telling&quot;, and he hopes that the way they&#x27;ve characterised the campaign&#x27;s principal faction, the Stormcast Eternals, will give players plenty to sink their teeth into when it launches in full.

This week is another shortie because Twitter is once again broken and refusing to show all the weekend&#x27;s posts, which sure feels ominous for the social media platform. The games are still good. Come on in for an immersive sim with a clever little technology trick, an adventure game set in a city on a giant octopus, the throwing of an egg, and more attractive and interesting indie games.

                              <span>In the same way that Alien: Isolation is, for many, now the definitive Ridley Scott’s Alien game, I’ve got no problem getting all ‘game critic who wants to feel important by making wild declarative statements’ and saying that Aliens: Dark Descent is now, for me at least, the definitive James Cameron’s Aliens game. It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.
Dark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here. What if there was a way to do XCOM but without all the knobbly bits?

                              <span>We already knew the folks behind Slay the Spire mod Downfall were making their own standalone game, Tales &amp; Tactics, and now we know when we’ll be able to play it. Tales &amp; Tactics, in case you’ve forgotten, is best pitched as a mixture of Slay the Spire and Dota Auto Chess; in other words, it’s a fantasy roguelike (like StS), where you can pick up abilities, gear and whatnot during each run, with auto-battling combat (like Auto Chess) - except here it’s on a hex board.

                              <span>Just in case your Steam wishlists weren&#x27;t already stocked up from this year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest bonanza, here we are with another edition of Valve&#x27;s Steam Next Fest, which has unleashed hundreds, if not thousands of free game demos on us, starting from today, June 19th, until Monday June 26th. You can view the entire June Next Fest line-up right here if you&#x27;d rather browse at your leisure, but we&#x27;ve also been playing some of the demos in advance to bring you some curated highlights of what we&#x27;ve enjoyed so far. We haven&#x27;t have access to every demo in this year&#x27;s Next Fest, I should note, but think of these more as some initial tasting suggestions to get you started, rather than a complete overview of what&#x27;s worth playing.

                              <span>One mistake I often see novice PC builders making is overspending on the motherboard. It&#x27;s true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you&#x27;re better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. 
One excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters.

For the money, you get a critically-acclaimed and good-sized mid-tower case, complete with support for modern (ie giant) components, three fans, and mesh panels used throughout to ensure a great balance between noise, dust and thermals.

                              <span>Boy howdy, Voidigo is lively. Think Nuclear Throne but weirder. Every sprite oozes a frantic combination of energy and personality, from the steel-eyed sprint of your starting gun-bird-thing to the bobbing scuttle of the cyclops clayfish boss. Guns have punch, stomps have oomph, reward boxes have merry jingles. It&#x27;s a top-down roguelike shooter that does everything right, and seldom have I seen a game more deserving of its Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. 
It left early access 11 days ago, which is 11 days you could have spent splatting crustaceans and wasps with skeleton trombones and deadly finger guns.

                              <span>If Mewgenics were an actual cat, it would be approaching its twilight years. It&#x27;s been nearly 11 years since Edmund Mcmillen, known for Super Meat Boy and Binding Of Isaac, first announced that the mysterious cat breed &#x27;em up would be Team Meat&#x27;s next game. The cats wound up waiting outside while they worked on other things, but we now have a much more concrete idea of what the game is.
The developers have actually been posting extensive development updates since January, but McMillen also just recorded an adhoc TikTok video where he points his phone at his screen. Turns out Mewgenics is a turn-based strategy roguelike with wizard cats who can cut their paws while opening windows. Could be worth the wait!

You&#x27;ll futz about with fighter planes, build listening posts around the globe, and send hapless soldiers to get their faces torn off. Merry Xenonauts!

Also you&#x27;re dead, and there are lots of silly jokes. 
I loved it, so I&#x27;m very pleased that the devs have just announced that Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances will be out at some point in 2024. It&#x27;s nearly time to get down and dirty with political philosophy, baby.

                              <span>The single most interesting thing you could tell me about Final Fantasy 16 is that it will have actually good combat. One of the developers has just said that, as of course they would, but not just any dev: we&#x27;re talking about Devil May Cry 5 design lead Ryota Suzuki, who&#x27;s dubbed FF16&#x27;s sword-slinging his &quot;personal masterpiece&quot;. 
I don&#x27;t take that at face value, but it has given me my first pangs of regret over selling my PS5. Those who didn&#x27;t sell their PS5 for travel money get to play in a few days, while PC players are in for an indefinitely long wait.

                              <span>Vývojář Red Hatu Richard Jones narazil na chybu, která celkem brzy po startu zasekne jádro 6.4, ale jen v jednom z asi 1000 případů. S procesorem Intel se to stává méně často, než s procesorem AMD.  Aby našel zdroj chyby, bylo potřeba dělat bisekci jader 6.0–6.4 a každé jádro bylo nutno pustit 1000×, aby se vyloučila chyba. Pokud se jádro zaseklo dříve, mohlo se pokračovat půlení intervalu dříve.</span>

It&#x27;s different to the endless demo that Alice wrote about in February, which isn&#x27;t available here. Instead, you get a taster of the game&#x27;s story and versus modes. And with that, an introduction to some of the characters you&#x27;ll meet (and maybe even date).

                              <span>Look at any image of heavy metal horror game The Axis Unseen and you’ll recognise an archetype: the stealth archer. For a certain sort of Elder Scrolls player, it’s the only way to travel through a fantasy open world - perma-crouched, bow stretched lazily across the lower third of the screen. And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.
“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one. I’m pretty sure what goes into these.”

                              <span>A decent name is one thing, but one like To Hell With The Ugly plain demands to be looked up. That&#x27;s when you see the striking art style, and yeah okay, I&#x27;m already on on board.
Based on a French novel by Boris Vian, this tells a strange and surprisingly dark story about a famously handsome young himbo who gets caught up in a sinister plot in 1950s Los Angeles and has to adventure, talk, fight, and - horrors - reason his way to the truth. It&#x27;s an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.

Listen, I know such console talk is considered heresy around these parts, but our corporate friends/siblings at sister site VG247 are running a competition right now to win a custom Company Of Heroes 3 Xbox controller. Sure, you might not want to play Company Of Heroes 3 specifically with said controller, but controllers in general are useful things that we at RPS use a lot for playing other types of games, and hey, we thought you might want to know about it, just in case. You can enter here if you fancy your chances.

                              <span>When Geoff Keighley announced in 2020 that he would be filling the space left by the recently cancelled E3 with his own gaming festival, none of us suspected that from that point on we would be doomed to an endless stream of   livestreams from now until the heat death of the universe. Did 2020&#x27;s summer of gaming ever end? It did not. It is a constant. Like the stars in the sky or the ocean blue. Geoff is here. He has a game to show you. It&#x27;s probably a horror game set in space. Doesn&#x27;t that look great? Now let&#x27;s take a look at the first game by a new studio comprised of ex-Bioware devs.


Yep, that&#x27;s right. Not-E3 2023 is over (I think?) and once again I&#x27;ve commanded team RPS to dig their microphones out of storage before forcing them to tell me about their favourite game from the cavalcade of directs, showcases and presentations that have replaced my once beloved E3 weekend.

                              <span>You know me, folks: I love management sims, and I love people in physical distress. Wasn&#x27;t I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby&#x27;s bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it&#x27;s harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.
The tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who&#x27;ll come to you for treatment.

Unlike Carn&#x27;s Barbarian, Quin69&#x27;s Druid wasn&#x27;t level 100 yet, but he was pretty darn close at level 91. His Druid had 172 hours and 50 minutes of play time. That&#x27;s more than a week&#x27;s worth of playing and the game&#x27;s only been out for 10 days (or 15, if we&#x27;re including early access).

                              <span>Memory can be a fickle thing. For thirty-something Mimi, everything before her thirteenth birthday is a blank. What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne&#x27;s three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi&#x27;s really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It&#x27;s this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi&#x27;s memory bottle, and it&#x27;s also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother&#x27;s recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora&#x27;s now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi&#x27;s apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life&#x27;s little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.

We got a small extra look at Gaiden last week during Summer Game Fest, where Kiryu looks like he&#x27;s meant to be starring in the next John Wick film, but the RGG Summit went into a lot more detail. Here&#x27;s what you need to know.

If you opted for one of the smaller capacities to save space, then consider this deal for a Sabrent Rocket Q4 2230 NVMe drive that offers a massive 2TB of storage for £160 - down from a usual price of £205. 
To get this deal, you&#x27;ll need to tick the box on the Amazon product page to get a 7% discount, then use the code SH4KDU9Z to unlock an extra discount.

                              <span>Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio&#x27;s upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you&#x27;re slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it&#x27;s nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it&#x27;s more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that&#x27;s fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn&#x27;t filled me with hope that it&#x27;ll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.

                              <span>I’m sure that describing Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors sounds like it’s betraying a terminal lack of imagination. But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. &quot;It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors&quot; is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.
And yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.

Alice even made up for her recording absence by pre-emptively tying Nate to a chair and forcibly making him watch trailers, like that bit in A Clockwork Orange but with &quot;WORLD EXCLUSIVE&quot; flashing up every thirty seconds. Still, we keep it light by focusing on the games we actually like the look of, from The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Starfield, Nova Roma to Dungeons of Hinterberg.

It normally retails close to its $159.99 MSRP, but today you can pick one up for $103.99 at Best Buy when you bring in any old peripheral for recycling - a pretty great deal for a brand new mouse of this calibre.

                              <span>Earlier this week, self-proclaimed &quot;unconventional ARPG&quot; Everhood 2 was revealed as part of IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming, and yep, it&#x27;s looking like a suitably weird follow-up to its 2021 predecessor. According to a press release, the sequel is due out in early 2025, so about a year and a half away as it stands, and you&#x27;ll of course be able to pick it up on Steam when it does. Come and watch its reveal trailer below.

                              <span>There are old games that are plain too hard to get into now, even I have to concede. Ancient ruins of a house to be admired and contemplated, but not fit to live in. The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn&#x27;t that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. 
It&#x27;s about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.
What I&#x27;m saying is: it&#x27;s still worth it.

                              <span>Dambuster Studios have offered up a rough roadmap of what we can expect from the pair of upcoming Dead Island 2 story expansions. The first of the two expansions, titled Haus, asks the question, &quot;How does a billionaire prepare for the zompocalypse?&quot; and answers that with &quot;a techno-death cult with a healthy splash of debauchery and gore!&quot;. Sounds about right. This first expansion has quite a vague release window, expected to launch some time between October and December this year.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve said it once, and I&#x27;ll say it several times again. I&#x27;m exceedingly pumped for Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown - and so is Prince Of Persia creator, Jordan Mechner. When I visited Ubisoft Montpellier at the end of May, one of things game director Mounir Radi told me about during my visit was how relieved he felt after showing Mechner a very early prototype. And in speaking to Mechner earlier this week about how he feels about The Lost Crown now, he tells me that &quot;what I&#x27;ve seen so far of their modern 2D Metroidvania take on [Prince Of Persia] has got me excited and very eager to play.&quot;

                              <span>Much as I adored Theme Park, it&#x27;s a bit of a weird game to have inspired so many descendants. The latest is Park Beyond, and for the most part it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect. Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.
That&#x27;s as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It&#x27;s more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you&#x27;re here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it&#x27;s mostly good news.

The new mode joins the game as part of its 1.4 update, and looks to be all about what it says on the tin - being creative! Essentially, the big thing it lets you do is build your own unique voxel structures by, essentially, painting them in the air. Think of it as a sort of paired back, voxel-focused approach to a piece of 3D modelling software like Blender.

This comes from People Can Fly themselves via a statement provided to Polish financial site Interia Biznes, where the studio shared that the game currently has the title Project Maverick (via Eurogamer). All of the funding is coming from Microsoft, with a budget ranging from $30-50m.

And, in doing so, they’ve let slip some details on the new range&#x27;s design and capabilities.

The speedy hog is forever occupying a booth and starring in some new-fangled thing, which oscillates between a 2D sidescroller laser-targeted at old-school fans, or 3D ones like Frontiers that try their utmost to push the series forwards.
So, I&#x27;ve gone and played another Sonic haven&#x27;t I? This time I spent around 15-minutes with Sonic Superstars at this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest, a new 2.5D sidescroller that seems to successfully combine the feel of Sonic Mania with a modern art style and some new tricks. If you like old Sonic games, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind you&#x27;ll love it. If you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s agony.

Valve announced the desktop update back in April, where the new version has been in beta for some Steam users to try out. In Valve&#x27;s post from yesterday announcing the update is available for all, it did note that the &quot;most impactful changes in this update aren’t immediately visible,&quot; as a lot of the work put into the update was today with how it &quot;[shares] code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck.&quot; According to Valve, these changes should mean that future features should be more quickly implemented and iterated upon.

                              <span>Lies Of P isn&#x27;t even out yet, but a group of modders have already tried turning the Soulslike into Bloodborne. The mod comes from Garden of Eyes, a YouTube channel and group of modders that typically work on FromSoftware titles (they&#x27;re the ones that made that long COVID mod for Elden Ring). Yesterday, though, they showed off a mod for Lies of P that lets you turn the game&#x27;s Timothy Chalamet-looking twink into a hunter from Bloodborne.

                              <span>I just finished promoting our previous deals post on a Samsung ultrawide, and now I&#x27;ve spotted another deal using the same 48HR20 discount code on another model - Samsung&#x27;s immensely impressive Odyssey Neo G7. 
This 32-inch curved VA monitor offers a mighty 4K resolution, 165Hz refresh rate and a Mini LED backlight that provides superb, almost OLED-like HDR performance - without the burn-in potential or agressive brightness limiters that often feature on OLED panels. Now this is a premium option, with a normal price point of £999, but today with the 48HR20 code it&#x27;s a slightly more palatable £799 at the Samsung UK store.

                              <span>Want to get an ultra-wide Samsung gaming monitor for less than £240? It sounds a bit too good to be true, but it&#x27;s possible thanks to the code 48HR20 over at Samsung&#x27;s UK site, which knocks this 34-inch ultrawide down from £299 to £239. That&#x27;s an awesome price for a monitor with a 3440x1440 resolution, 100Hz refresh rate and a VA panel with excellent contrast.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that by a mere two votes that glowing wings are better than slipstreaming. Two votes! Honestly, I am surprised by the outcome but if that&#x27;s what our infallible method rules, so be it. This week, I ask you to choose between a thing which helps you create something big, and a thing which gives you consequences after destroying something small.
