                              <span>There&#x27;s a bit of an obsession among modern horror fandoms to find the one &quot;true&quot; theory behind pieces of media - one that the creators must have hidden from ordinary consumers that explains everything. Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s comes to mind, along with a deluge of MatPat videos and Reddit posts trying to pull at phantom threads and chasing ghosts. 


Silent Hill 2, on the other hand, has the benefit of a very outspoken original creator, Masahiro Ito, who is more than happy to clear up any hare-brained tall tales. His most recent feedback? Dealing with fan theories is exhausting. 


The latest &quot;headcanon,&quot; as Ito called it over on Twitter, came in the form of a thread on the site that has since been deleted claiming that, in the remake, James isn&#x27;t actually in Silent Hill, Mary isn&#x27;t real, a…</span>

                              <span>The second story DLC for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has been hit by a last-minute delay, Ubisoft has confirmed, surprising everyone who forgot about said DLC. Announced for a November 26 release date last month, Secrets of the Spires will now launch on November 28.


It&#x27;s not a massive delay by any means, but Ubisoft still took the time to announce it via X, along with an apology. 


&quot;Due to a critical last-minute issue, the launch date of the Secrets of the Spires story pack for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is moving to November 28,&quot; Ubisoft wrote in the message. &quot;We know many of you are eagerly awaiting this new adventure in the Western Frontier, and we apologize for this delay. Our priority is delivering a high-quality, enjoyable, and memorable experience for all of our players.&quot;

                              <span>If you find the overall economy in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl extremely taxing, there&#x27;s a cool glitch that can make you the billionaire of The Zone.


The Zone can be a menacing area, especially if you&#x27;re a first-time Stalker. Constantly repairing your weapons and gear can become quite taxing, and it&#x27;s not fun to earn paltry amounts of coupons by doing basic tasks. The current glitch has become a popular one with the community, and as of writing, it&#x27;s yet to be fixed.


Stalker 2 infinite money glitch explained


To trigger the glitch, you&#x27;ll need to reach Zalissya, which is the first town. Located in the Lesser Zone, this place will be your first base (of sorts), and there are plenty of quests you can trigger. Once you&#x27;ve found a few consumables and ammo, return to the trader.

                              <span>As spotted by Video Games Chronicle, some Ubisoft games have stopped working after users updated their Windows 11 operating system to its latest version. Windows 11 version 24H2, Windows 11&#x27;s third big update, is responsible for bricking many of Ubisoft&#x27;s most popular releases recently. 


It&#x27;s an unfortunate issue, but Microsoft has already acknowledged it.


“After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games,” and, “These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay. In some cases, users might receive a black screen. ”


The affected games, as acknowledged by Microsoft, are:
-Star Wars Outlaws
-Assassin’s Creed Valhalla
-Assassin’s Creed Origins
-Assassin’s Creed Odyssey
-Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora


The update in question does not roll out immediately, so Microsoft recommends you do not use Microsoft&#x27;s tools to install it manually if you&#x27;re into these games. The company stated:


“We recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved,”


Ubisoft has already released a temporary hotfix to make Star Wars Outlaws run for people who have already updated their systems. Still, the company warns that its software does not provide a complete solution to this issue.


“We have just deployed a temporary hotfix (v1.4.1) for players who were experiencing issues playing on Windows 11 24H2,” and, “Please note that you may experience some performance issues while we work on a more permanent fix. As soon as it is ready, we will let you know.”


We still don&#x27;t know which of the update&#x27;s features is causing the issues, but Microsoft will likely provide more information as the situation evolves. Till then, we recommend anyone interested in any of Ubisoft&#x27;s titles to put the idea of updating Windows 11 on hold.

                              <span>The FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete this challenge to earn yourself a really valuable pack.


Like all fodder challenges, it&#x27;s not very difficult to complete the current SBC. You should be able to complete it with items that are already present in your club. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can complete the latest challenge and what rewards are waiting for you at the end. 


EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC tasks


The FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC has one task, and here are its conditions. 


Task - FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC



Min. Leagues in Squad: 5


Min. Nationalities in Squad: 4


Max. 3 Players from the same Club


Min. 3 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 80


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31



EA FC 25 FC Pro Live Challenge 1 SBC solutions


While the priority is to use cards that are already present in your Ultimate Team collection, you can use the following solution to complete the challenge easily. 



Petermann ST 79


Dunst LM 80


Freigang CAM 83


Corley CAM 77


Jonsdottir RM 82


Lattwein CM 80


Rauch LB 82


Garcia Posadas CM 59


Kohr CB 75


Leinherne RB 80


Nubel GK 80



After completing the challenge, you&#x27;ll get a Premium Gold Players Pack. This pack includes 12 Gold player items, with 1 of them rated 80 or higher, and 3 are guaranteed to be of the Rare type. The cost of the pack is far more valuable than the cost of the fodder you&#x27;ll need to complete the challenge. 


Make sure to finish this SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. With Black Friday celebrations beginning soon, there will never be a better time to collect as many packs as possible.

                              <span>Aquatic Escargot in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a dish many would likely avoid in real life. However, some of your friends, like Stitch or Belle in the game, might love a bite of this three-star dish.


Aquatic Escargot Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To cook up the Aquatic Escargot for yourself or restaurant guests, you&#x27;ll need the following:



Trumpet Snail


Salt Crystal


Garlic

Trumpet Snails can be acquired at The Bind. You can find them on the ground like an herb. They look like a strange shell engrained in the soil. Garlic can also be picked up from the ground, but you&#x27;ll have to go back to the Forest of Valor in the original valley where our story began. Look for the green stems that are reaching out of the ground.


Lastly, Salt Crystals can be fished from the waters of Everafter, Maleficent&#x27;s dominion in the new land. Don&#x27;t fish within the ripples, however. You&#x27;ll want to fish from outside them to gain the Salt Crystal you require. Thankfully, you don&#x27;t need to grow any crops for this recipe.


Once you have all of the ingredients, head to any cooking station, such as your home or Chez Remy. Throw the ingredients into the pot, and you&#x27;ll have the Aquatic Escargot dish. Congrats! Hopefully, our French residents like Belle or The Beast will be happy.


There are many other dishes you can make in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and these will likely make you more Star Coins than the Aquatic Escargot. You can sell this meal to Goofy&#x27;s Stall for 182 Star Coins or gain 581 Energy from eating it.

Stuffed Ring Squash Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


You&#x27;ll need these three ingredients to create this healthy dish in Disney Dreamlight Valley:



Ring Squash


Ambrosia


Garlic

You can purchase Ring Squash seeds from Goofy&#x27;s Stall in The Bind for 20 Star Coins each. You&#x27;ll need to grow the crop. Dig up a bit of the ground, plant the Ring Squash seeds, and then water the plants. You&#x27;ll have to wait 30 minutes for it to grow completely. You can use a Miracle Growth Potion, however. This has the ingredients grow immediately after watering them after drinking the potion. You can create one by using a crafting station and blending the following ingredients:



10 Vitalys Crystals


10 Rich Soil


500 Dreamlight



How to get the other ingredients


Another ingredient, Ambrosia, can also be purchased from Goofy at his stall in Mythopia&#x27;s The Elysian Fields. It&#x27;s a golden liquid within a vial. It costs 140 Star Coins to get this resource. 


The last ingredient Garlic is obtained from the grounds of the Forest of Valor. Fast travel back to the original land that introduced us to Disney Dreamlight Valley. Once you get to the Forest of Valor look towards the grass, and you&#x27;ll see the ingredient growing from within with green stems flowing out. 


Once you have all of the ingredients, head to any cooking station, possibly within your house or at Chez Remy with the famous rat chef, you can sell the meal for 225 Star Coins or eat it for 980 Energy.

                              <span>Chia Seed Bread in Disney Dreamlight Valley sounds like a healthy option for Mickey, Flynn Rider, and Mulan. Thankfully, the ingredients are fairly easy to get.


Chia Seed Bread Disney Dreamlight Valley Ingredients


First, you&#x27;ll need to purchase the Disney Dreamlight Valley Storybook Vale DLC to access this recipe and its ingredients. Once that&#x27;s done, the three-star dish Chia Seed Bread is made with the following ingredients: 



Chia


Shovel Bird Egg


Wheat



Screenshot by Destructoid


Chia Seeds can be purchased from Goofy&#x27;s Stall in The Bind. They are available for 5 Star Coins each. You can also find Shovel Bird Eggs from this same stall. They can be purchased for 160 Star Coins each. Thankfully, the Chia Seeds only take five minutes to grow after being planted and watered. 


The last ingredient, Wheat, is also at Goofy&#x27;s Stall, but you&#x27;ll have to go back to the original valley. Head over to the Peaceful Meadow and visit one of Mickey&#x27;s best friends there. His stall will have Wheat Seeds for 1 Star Coin. 


Once you have all of the ingredients, go to any cooking station in your home or at Chez Remy and place them all in the pot. You should now have Chia Seed Bread. It can be sold for 122 Star Coins or be eaten for 478 Energy. 


Other recipes that can be made


Chia Seed Pudding is one of the easiest recipes to make in the Storybook Vale DLC expansion. You&#x27;ll only need one Chia in the pot to make it. You can also create a lovely Golden Apple Smoothie by mixing in a Golden Apple and Yogurt at a cooking station, providing 299+ Gold Coins or 985+ Energy.

                              <span>Scottish Porridge in Disney Dreamlight Valley is a simple two-star recipe that would make residents like Merida very happy. It&#x27;s made with a new ingredient that can be spotted in Everafter. 


Scottish Porridge Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients


To make Scottish Porridge, you only need two ingredients:



Oats


Any fruit



Screenshot by Destructoid


Sounds simple, right? This isn&#x27;t made like the typical Porridge from the past, however, with just wheat and milk. You&#x27;ll need to get the Oats ingredient from Goofy&#x27;s Stall in The Wild Woods area. It&#x27;s on the west side of Storybook Vale, where Everafter is located. After starting up the stall, you should have the oat seeds available. They&#x27;re 150 Star Coins each. 


How to make farming quicker


After acquiring them, plant them in the ground and grow them with some water. Unfortunately, they&#x27;ll grow in two lengthy hours. You can speed up the process by making a Miracle Growth Elixir. They&#x27;re made at a crafting table with the following:



10 Vitalys Crystals


10 Rich Soils


500 Dreamlight



Vitalys Crystals are gained from the cave within the waterfall of Sunlit Plateau. Mine the rocks inside there. Rich Soil can be grabbed by digging up the ground, planting vegetables/fruit, and then gathering the crops. 


Once you have all of these materials, go to a crafting table and make the Miracle Growth Elixir. Plant the oats you want to grow and then bury them in the ground. Use the Miracle Growth Elixir, take out the water can, and then start watering the crops. They&#x27;ll instantly grow. 


Now that you have the Oats, go to a cooking station in Chez Remy or your house. Place one serving of oats and one fruit, like raspberries, into the pot. You&#x27;ll then have Scottish Porridge in your inventory.

But let&#x27;s not get ahead of ourselves; the first step is mastering the basics before you venture out into open waters, and on that front, we&#x27;ve got you covered.

An annoying mechanic that is compounded further in The Storybook Vale


The Disney Dreamlight Valley Storybook Vale DLC has been fun over the past week or so as we meet new friends like Flynn Rider and create statues for the mighty Hades. However, the inventory system is starting to spoil the magic of this game. 


From day one, we have been stretched with limited inventory space that is used for everything we collect: food, quest items, ingredients, etc. It&#x27;s always frustrating when you&#x27;re farming, and you can&#x27;t pick anything new up because of the inventory spa…</span>

                              <span>The Ramon Hendriks FC Pro Live SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can get an upgradeable item in Ultimate Team.


This special card is associated with former champion ManuBachoore, who will be participating with 23 other esports pros in the FC Pro Open championship. To unlock the card, you&#x27;ll have to complete the SBC from Ultimate Team before it expires. Let&#x27;s take a look at the tasks and their conditions and if you should complete the SBC. 


EA FC 25 Ramon Hendriks FC Pro Live SBC tasks


The Ramon Hendriks FC Pro Live SBC has two different tasks. Here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - Netherlands 



# of players from the Netherlands: Min 1

EA FC 25 Ramon Hendriks FC Pro Live SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest challenge in EA FC 25. 


Task 1 - Netherlands 



Catarina Macario 84


Baltimore 84


Hasegawa 84


En-Nesyri 83


Palacios 84


Benzema 86


Gakpo 83


Klingenberg 82


Fullkrug 82


Grealish 84


Iago Aspas 84



Task 2 - Bundesliga



Vitinha 85


Alex Remiro 84


Grimaldo 86


Little 86


De Ligt 84


Buchanan 84


Guirassy 84


Gakpo 83


Benzema 86


Grealish 84


Casemiro 84



If I judge the Ramon Hendriks special item based on its current stats, it looks expensive. It&#x27;s an 86-rated CB item with decent pace (84), Defense (86), and Physicality (84). The presence of Jockey, Block, Anticipate, and Aerial playstyles are great, and he also has Defender+. 


However, ManuBachoore is certainly one of the better players in the FC Pro Open tournament, and I expect his item to get at least three levels of upgrades. What appears expensive right now can soon turn out to be a bargain in the long run.

How to build the Fish Pond


First, you&#x27;ll need to actually build a Fish Pond back at your farm in Stardew Valley. In order to build a Fish Pond, you need to visit Robin at the Carpenter&#x27;s Shop between 9:00 am - 5:00 pm on any day other than Tuesday. Robin can build a variety of important structures at your farm including the Fish Pond. Building the Fish Pond has the following building material costs:

                              <span>The Lullaby assault rifle is certainly one of the better guns you can yield in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and it&#x27;s a reward locked exclusively for those who have purchased the Ultimate Edition.


But simply spending the extra dollars (or whatever currency that applies to you) isn&#x27;t enough, for you&#x27;ll have to obtain the gun by solving the mission. As in this case, there&#x27;s a specific Journalist Stash that you&#x27;ll need to find, which unlocks the gun for any use inside the game.


Lullaby Assault Rifle location in Stalker 2


To get this gun, you&#x27;ll have to reach a location called Army Warehouses. This POI is situated in the Central Plant region, and there are plenty of things to loot over here. You&#x27;ll find a locked room at this location, which can be unlocked with a code. Make sure to check out our guide to know more about how to get the loot.


If you have the Ultimate Edition (Deluxe Edition isn&#x27;t enough), you will have an additional pop-up on your map when you reach the Army Warehouses location. Instead of having to settle with one set of rewards, you can actually double your yield.

How to extract the Lullaby Assault Rifle in Stalker 2


Once you&#x27;ve reached the spot, you&#x27;ll notice a truck parked around the exterior wall. Jump on top of it to reach a metal overhang. From there, you can crawl to enter the building. This will lead you to the Lullaby assault rifle stash and the key that enables you to get the Army Warehouses code.


To get the code, you&#x27;ll have to put in some extra effort, and you can read that in your guide as mentioned above. If you&#x27;re a Deluxe Edition owner, you can get the Monolith AR416. This is another handy rifle to use, and it can be obtained quite easily by following the steps mentioned in this guide.

From coping stalkers to dealing with those annoying bats, here’s how to beat all monsters in Exiled Roblox.


How to Cope All Monsters in Exiled


Each monster in Exiled has a specific way you need to deal with it to avoid getting killed. Let’s list all of them, and then I’ll talk about strategies for each one:



Stone Golem


Bat


Flesh Hunter


Stalker


Traps



While traps aren’t technically monsters, they can also kill you. So I’ll show you how to deal with them or even use them to kill other monsters. Note that you cannot kill any monsters unless you use traps. I don’t recommend trying to hit them with your torch as you’ll…</span>

                              <span>Crossbows are excellent fallbacks for your party in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. When the enemy is just too far away, or maybe when you want a little distance, they&#x27;re always there for you. And the Hellfire Engine Crossbow adds some heavy artillery to your Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 arsenal.


This special crossbow can be crafted in Act 3 of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, once you&#x27;ve reached the Lower City. It&#x27;s tied into the quest to Disable the Steel Watch, but before you go blowing the place to smithereens, take a tour through the factory. The Hellfire Engine Crossbow is very much worth picking up, especially for the ensuing fights in the Foundry.

A huge new content update is now on the horizon, adding a little something for virtually every kind of player.


Broadly speaking, the majority of Manor Lords&#x27; updates have been on the smaller side of the spectrum so far. One of the more prominent updates introduced fishing ponds, for example, which is a far cry from what&#x27;s coming in the next patch. With two brand new maps headlining the content list, Manor Lords developer Slavic Magic is about to substantially expand the game&#x27;s content roster, as well as overhauling some of its more problematic and/or questionable simulation aspects.

                              <span>Murder on the Point-and-Click Express.
It&#x27;s a story you&#x27;ve probably heard before: there&#x27;s a detective, a rich, old heiress with an amended will, and an assembled group of people all hoping to benefit from it. And then, as these stories usually do, it ends in murder. On a train! But don&#x27;t be fooled by the plentiful Agatha Christie-isms: this work of whodunnitry is wholly unique while paying tribute to its influences, and may even be one of our favourite modern point-and-clicks.
In the astoundingly well-named Loco Motive, you play as three separate characters – Arthur, a paperwork-loving estate attorney; Herman Merman, a crime novel-author-turned-detective; and Diana, a spy and bounty hunter working for the Inland Revenue Service, which we really hope isn&#x27;t a real thing. These three are your guides as you try to piece together the mysterious and sudden murder of a rich matriarch on a train through a series of goofy, absurd item combinations, interspersed with plot twists, reveals, and comedic cutscenes.

Piggyback, the company behind the official guides for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, has announced that it is once again teaming up with Nintendo on another release. But this is no guide. It&#x27;s a Metroid Prime art book.
&#x27;Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective&#x27; launches in Summer 2025, bringing a celebration of the series&#x27; artwork to coffee tables around the world. Inside, we can expect to find all manner of drawings and illustrations from Prime, Echoes and Corruption, printed on premium sheet paper with a gorgeous metallic foil hardcover. Oof.

We love a bit of niche video game history here at Nintendo Life, and the work of Mr Talida (aka Keshi Corner) has caught our attention on more than one occasion. This is the 3D scanning specialist that has ensured rare Zelda and Mario figures from the 1980s and &#x27;90s live to fight another day and now, they have turned their attention to DK.
Celebrating Donkey Kong Country&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Mr Talida has been hard at work scanning the game&#x27;s tie-in Keshi figures (small, unpainted rubber figurines found in gachapon machines) that Bandai produced in Japan in 1995.

The trailer gives Sonic (and Shadow) fans plenty to chew over, with Gerald Robotnik, the Space Colony ARK, and Maria Robotnik — crucial to Shadow&#x27;s backstory — showcased.

Released in 2007 by EA Redwood Shores, MySims was an attempt to capitalise on the increasing popularity of Animal Crossing (the excellent Wild World had released two years prior). A chibi-styled spin-off from the main Sims franchise, this series skewed towards a younger audience and had players rejuvenate a community with friendship and brightly coloured furniture.
MySims Cozy Bundle pairs the original release with MySims Kingdom, an expansive sequel with a medieval theme. Switch isn’t exactly wanting for a chilled-out town builder. All of the genre&#x27;s greatest examples already live on Nintendo’s console. What does this remaster bring to the table that makes it a worthy alternative to the likes of Tom Nook’s Debt Simulator and the seminal Stardew Valley?

Koei Tecmo Europe has released a new update for Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake for the Nintendo Switch, adding in a whole bunch of additions, improvements, and bug fixes.
Bringing the game up to version 1.0.4, perhaps the most significant changes here are to do with difficulty settings. We&#x27;ve got a new &#x27;Advanced&#x27; option alongside &#x27;Custom&#x27; difficulty toggles which lets you adjust specific parameters within the game.

                              <span>But it&#x27;s likely several years away.
We know what you&#x27;re thinking, and yes, it certainly feels like rumours of a new PlayStation handheld have been swirling since... well, probably since the launch of the Vita. But now, we have a slightly more credible report from Bloomberg (thanks, VGC), claiming that Sony may well be developing a new &#x27;PSP&#x27; to compete more directly with Nintendo.
According to Bloomberg, development of a new handheld is in the early stages and, much like Microsoft&#x27;s planned portable device, likely won&#x27;t launch for some years to come. As such, the company may still decide against bringing it to market, though given the remarkable success of the Switch and the hype surrounding its successor, we honestly wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Sony dipped its toes further back into the world of handheld gaming.

                              <span>Many are the horror games that involve you going down. Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you&#x27;re talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn&#x27;t really matter, because you don&#x27;t have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

                              <span>I’ve always liked the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro mouse, a lightweight wireless version of the equally comfortable and responsive Basilisk V3. Yet it’s usually been just a few tenners too expensive for me to say &quot;You, RPS reader, buy this&quot;, and since telling people what to buy is around 40% of this job, well, that just leaves a peripheral-shaped hole in my heart.

                              <span>&quot;James, please don’t just make half your Black Friday deal posts about Steam Deck stuff again&quot;, warns a steely-eyed Graham. &quot;I won’t&quot;, I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

                              <span>The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game&#x27;s janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed &quot;A-life&quot; by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to &quot;emergent&quot; moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It&#x27;s just broken.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s &quot;in the grim darkness of the far future…&quot; tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are among the weirdly publisher-specific victims of Windows 11 version 24H2, which by Microsoft’s admission (well spotted, Bleeping Computer) is causing crashes and crap performance in the affected games. Even after, in Outlaws’ case, Ubisoft responded to the complaints with their own patch.

                              <span>Manor Lords developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, has emerged from his keep with news of a forthcoming patch for the medieval city builder. It&#x27;ll add new maps, building upgrades and reworks for various economic systems.
The announcement post is mostly image-based, in keeping with the classic saying that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as the words in question are mostly synonyms for &#x27;hut&#x27;, &#x27;mud&#x27;, &#x27;tree&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27;&quot;. Fortunately, Styczeń threw in a few captions to light the way.

Literally, that’s what the streets are saying. “It’s good! A bit shonky, though!” opined my postman this morning, enunciating each syllable by yanking the package further from my grasp. “Don’t worry!” I said. “A patch for the FPS is coming next week”. “That’s cheered me right up, that has!

Its compound eyes contract or dim or vanish entirely. Its limbs lengthen, forming contrails from the Arctic to Antarctica (what, did you think those were from planes? Haha. Hahahaha.)

Stray caught everyone a little by surprise when it first leapt onto PlayStation consoles back in 2022. A cyberpunk platformer where you play as a cute kitty sure looked sweet, but it was surprisingly heartfelt? Surprisingly fun to play?

Things blew up really rather fast, with the cat platformer (catformer?) going on to be nominated at just about every awards show going. It even picked up a few big ones, including Best Independent Game at The Game Awards. Having clawed its way onto Xbox last year, we imagined it was only a matter of time before the cute kitty made its way to Switch. And right we were. Stray slinked into the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, with a November 19th release date following shortly after.

When this new project was originally announced in September last year, there was no Nintendo announcement at that point, so there you go!

Sega&#x27;s latest Sonic Central shared all sorts of updates, including a look at the story in the upcoming release Sonic X Shadow Generations. However, it didn&#x27;t end there, with Sony&#x27;s &#x27;State of Play&#x27; broadcast sharing a little bit more information.
In case you missed it, Sega announced there will be some special Sonic 3 movie content coming later this year on 12th December 2024. Most notably, Keanu Reeves will feature in a special update where he voices Shadow. This &#x27;Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack&#x27; is inspired by scenes from the third live-action movie.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

Who the heck spends seven years making a video game about animals — literally, just animals?
The game in question, Animal Well, isn’t a farm game, it’s not a virtual pet game, it’s not even some kind of cosy simulator.

Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo&#x27;s Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard&#x27;s Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element&#x27;s, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

                              <span>The mutant enemies in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it&#x27;s a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it&#x27;s already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

                              <span>Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you&#x27;re slinging is a &quot;solar-powered&quot; pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai&#x27;s debut didn&#x27;t result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp&#x27;s coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

                              <span>Upon some serious soul searching following a little time with the early access build of open world game Vivat Slovakia, I have unfortunately had to admit to myself that it is probably not the GTA 6 killer I was hoping for. This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>Kill The Man In The House is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children&#x27;s book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there&#x27;s a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. Mossflower TW is a campaign mod for Medieval II: Total War expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable strategy game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a &quot;shinobi and assassin arsenal&quot; of smoke bombs and bells.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for &#x27;double assassinations&#x27; again.

                              <span>Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it&#x27;s rubbish, some others think it&#x27;s basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it&#x27;s one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are &quot;incredibly punishing&quot;.

Now there&#x27;s a new patch, apparently Outlaws&#x27; biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

                              <span>I go through this life burdened by the knowledge that I will never be framed for murder on a luxurious, multiple-day train journey. Not for me the thrill of flushing out the true culprit (or culprits???) between visits to the exquisitely upholstered dining car, against the backdrop of passing mountains. The best I can hope for is getting chewed out for hogging the toilet on a crowded commuter train to Leeds.

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor&#x27;s wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

In Avowed, you are the god-touched envoy of a distant emperor, sent to an island realm known as the Living Lands to investigate a mysterious blight. &quot;God-touched&quot;, in this case, means &quot;fungal and a bit mermaidy&quot;. It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

                              <span>Gang Beasts is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy&#x27;s head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

                              <span>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn&#x27;t of me and my pal. No, it wasn&#x27;t of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn&#x27;t seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume together in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there&#x27;s a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It&#x27;s nice!

Buggier than Kafka&#x27;s Metamorphosis. In our S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review, wasteland wanderer James called it &quot;easily the most borked FPS I&#x27;ve played in years&quot;, detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly.

                              <span>Did last week&#x27;s paranormal body-swapper Slitterhead leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you&#x27;ll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you&#x27;re a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.
Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading &quot;DANGER: BUGS&quot;. In Ukrainian, obviously.

Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You&#x27;re piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: &quot;I hope this hurts.&quot;

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn&#x27;t known, as Reflector haven&#x27;t made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

                              <span>A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice sheds light on people&#x27;s motivations to use Z-Library. Expensive books and limited access to academic material play a key role among those surveyed. That includes a group of Chinese postgraduate students who believe that shadow libraries help to overcome (academic) poverty.

                              <span>A team of hackers from Brazil have taken first place in a hackathon organized by the country&#x27;s telecoms regulator. The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved &#x27;pirate&#x27; set-top devices from functioning in people&#x27;s homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, &quot;there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,&quot; the hacker predicted.

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)</span>

                              <span>As I wrote about last week within the Supermicro H13SSL-N EPYC Turin motherboard review, one of the factors leading me to purchasing that EPYC 9005 series motherboard was that this board offered support for full 12 channel DDR5-6000 memory performance compared to some of the other lower-cost Socket SP5 motherboards offering just 8 memory channels. For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 &quot;Turin&quot; processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.</span>

Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet&#x27;s core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let&#x27;s take a closer look at how things play out.

                              <span>A new survey from Norway reveals that 50% of young people under 30 believe that pirating content is an acceptable way to save money.  The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

                              <span>Remedy&#x27;s Control 2 will be an &quot;action RPG&quot;, the developers have announced, and while I have already caved and written it up, I&#x27;m not sure this is really news. Wasn&#x27;t the first game an action-RPG? True, it was a third-person shooter, but it also had a progression system with unlockable abilities and boosts. Besides, isn&#x27;t every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn&#x27;t have RPG-style elements. No wait, don&#x27;t actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.

                              <span>My time with Threshold has been fraught with pain. Five times. Five times I had to restart this psychological horror game because of some game-breaking bug. And yet, I persevered, booting it back up and returning to my government-mandated shift atop a quiet mountain.
Ultimately, I gave Threshold chance after chance because I was totally taken by my shift and my immense desire to find out just what I was actually doing. Anyway, it&#x27;s time for me to clock off! I urge you to take over until I&#x27;m back. It&#x27;s worth it.

These broadly consist of combat and balance overhauls together with changes for the Skirmish &amp; War Games modes, though they&#x27;ve shown the campaign a little love as well.

                              <span>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their stinking rat hordes - it builds upon the 2020 game by &quot;[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming&quot;, in the words of the launch announcement release.
We&#x27;ve got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of &quot;machine learning&quot; technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it&#x27;ll devour as you play.

I&#x27;ve since played a few games of a similar ilk that don&#x27;t hammer you with a chaos that&#x27;s impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is Bloodshed, an old school FPS take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase &quot;just one more run&quot;.

                              <span>I am a very casual enjoyer of Metal Slug games. I&#x27;ve never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: &quot;ah, that was good.&quot;
So what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun &#x27;em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot. And you still walk away feeling fairly happy about it.

Hra změnila navždy svět počítačových her a okamžitě uchvátila miliony hráčů po celém světě. Co ji ale dělá tak výjimečnou, je její schopnost spojit lidi napříč kontinenty, nabídnout jim obrovské a živé světy k prozkoumání a hluboký příběh, který se neustále vyvíjí.

                              <span>Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

                              <span>Spanish police have shut down Cristal Azul, a popular Kodi add-on with an estimated 78,000 users. As sports rightsholders claim the fraudulent access cost them €42 million, in piracy circles the shutdown is being linked to a change of policy at Telegram. A direct warning that personal details could be handed over by Telegram coincides with some piracy groups abandoning the platform.

                              <span>It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn&#x27;t even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It&#x27;s like the &quot;glass half empty&quot; mindset, but the bartender hasn&#x27;t even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you&#x27;ve wandered into the local antique shop. Well I, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the &quot;bar&quot;, gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.
In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of Left 4 Dead homage Back 4 Blood. Rumour has it that they&#x27;re making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don&#x27;t want a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015&#x27;s Evolve, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. &quot;A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please,&quot; I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman&#x27;s travelling suitcase from the 1920s.

I hope one day to level up from &quot;bumbling, tumbling and blundering&quot; to &quot;running and jumping&quot;. Perhaps I&#x27;ll even get as far as &quot;speedrunning&quot;. But in the likely event that I plateau at &quot;blundering&quot;, it&#x27;s a relief to know that developer Rubeki Games has updated the game with an Explore Mode that makes certain sections dramatically easier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to work out if I&#x27;m keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes&#x27; hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer&#x27;s boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn&#x27;t like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It&#x27;s also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. 


I definitely didn&#x27;t see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there&#x27;s a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe&#x27;s pre-alpha &quot;prelude&quot;: I&#x27;m keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren&#x27;t encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.

                              <span>Train, one of Counter-Strike&#x27;s oldest and bestest maps, has received a sweeping update. Valve&#x27;s given the fairly nondescript trainyard a &quot;full visual overhaul&quot; in Counter-Strike 2, making it &quot;60% cloudier&quot; and changing its layout to encourage more tactical play besides just whipping out the AWP and looking down long, narrow corridors.

                              <span>A senator for the US government has urged Valve to answer complaints about the amount of racist, sexist and otherwise hateful posts and imagery shared by users on Steam. The digital store was the subject of a report by the Anti-Defamation League last week, which claimed to find millions of examples of &quot;hateful or extremist&quot; language and images hosted on Steam&#x27;s community. These include things like Nazi symbols in profile pictures, white supremacist slogans in group names, and yet more discriminatory spew in user posts. The senator has noticed this report, and now writes directly to Gabe Newell, demanding that Valve &quot;bring its content moderation practices in line with industry standards&quot; or risk &quot;intense scrutiny&quot; from the government.

True, games like Invisigun have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it&#x27;s framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:

                              <span>Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně &quot;zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!&quot; (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.

                              <span>A new trend has emerged on YouTube where &#x27;scammy&#x27; channels facing a ban for copyright infringement appear to evade penalties through the use of sexually explicit content. Questions remain, but evidence does suggest that a loophole is being exploited. By avoiding termination for copyright infringement, these channel owners may be able to protect their linked AdSense accounts.

This is surely the best link this week: an hour-long video on how to beat &quot;every possible game of Pokemon Platinum at the same time&quot;. That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously.

The documentary includes in-progress footage of the episode in action for the first time, and it shows an ice gun and a new liquid enemy type.

The ISP subpoenaed the music group to obtain potential key evidence for use in its defense against a piracy liability lawsuit filed by record labels. Faced with the RIAA&#x27;s objections, Altice has filed a motion to compel.

                              <span>Four thousand words of notes. Hoboy. Field of Glory Colon Kingdoms is definitely thought-provoking.
It was also complaint-provoking in the fairly long period where I didn&#x27;t understand what it&#x27;s trying to do. Reaching that point, luckily for you, means we can cut out a lot of the &quot;confused whingeing&quot; subsection of those notes. Though it still has its shortcomings, I&#x27;ve come to appreciate that I was reading Kingdoms all wrong. Although it talks big about characters, politics, and religion, they&#x27;re not what it&#x27;s about. It&#x27;s about building.

                              <span>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It&#x27;s part of a &quot;restructuring&quot; that&#x27;ll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in a press release yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it&#x27;s an intentional move that&#x27;ll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers.

                              <span>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been &#x27;out&#x27; of strategy autobattler Mechabellum since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back in September. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.
Update 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as &quot;a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles&quot;. It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.

                              <span>2024 has been a pretty rough year for Nintendo-loving emulator fans. At this point it&#x27;s clear that they can either choose Nintendo, or Switch emulators, but they can&#x27;t have relationships with both. At least not in public. During the last few hours Nintendo began targeting Pomelo, a popular Switch emulator for iOS devices. Like similar emulators before it, Pomelo&#x27;s disclaimer against piracy is redundant. Thanks to its family tree, it has nowhere left to go.

                              <span>Sorry We&#x27;re Closed is a retro survival horror-inspired game about escaping the clutches of an excessively horny demon who desperately wants your heart. As someone who isn&#x27;t often into the &#x27;lore&#x27; behind things and prefers to just shoot and ask questions later, I found myself actually asking the questions. I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character&#x27;s own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.
But when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I&#x27;d enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it&#x27;s just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.

                              <span>In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say &quot;lol, it me&quot; with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter &quot;ugh, it me&quot; and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

                              <span>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

                              <span>The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap &quot;should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.&quot; But do you?

                              <span>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter Unreal to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They&#x27;ve also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

                              <span>Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a &#x27;Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest&#x27;, which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

In addition to the usual charges relating to the distribution of unlicensed streams, initial reports suggest that cybersecurity crimes relating to the functionality of the Magis TV software will also feature among the charges.

                              <span>BREIN has obtained a new blocking order in the Netherlands targeting TorrentGalaxy, one the world&#x27;s most popular torrent sites.  Internet provider Odido objected to the request, arguing that the Dutch anti-piracy group could have done more to target the problem closer to the source. The Rotterdam District Court found that the anti-piracy group can&#x27;t be expected to do more than it&#x27;s already done.

                              <span>Over the years, game retailers GOG have drifted from almost purely offering classic oldies to welcoming more and more modern blockbusters onto their storefront. In one sense, they&#x27;ve turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware. And you&#x27;ll be able to tell which games have got this restoration treatment from a fancy badge plastered on top of them.

                              <span>Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you&#x27;ve made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I&#x27;ve found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

                              <span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&#x27;s premise is bluntly, delightfully simple. The Archfiend Baramos, as evil as he is mysterious, is up and about. He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

                              <span>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

                              <span>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were &quot;born in Chornobyl?&quot; as a play on &quot;were you born in a barn?&quot; whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been &quot;you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?&quot;, because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

                              <span>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as &quot;co-developers&quot; on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

                              <span>After nearly a year of public beta honing, the Nvidia App – Team Green’s new one-stop shop for desktop GPU management – is out in full. Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

                              <span>My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter&#x27;s job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

The game is launching a &quot;Classic&quot; mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

As reported by Polygon, that&#x27;s an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of The Crew. They&#x27;re suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the racing game&#x27;s servers, rendering it unplayable.

                              <span>Sin enjoyed the roguelike stylings of Dungeons of Blood and Dream when she played it in early access back in July, calling it a “baffling, bizarre thing that lives on the border of janky, retro, and punk”. As of yesterday, it’s now out for realsies, promising psychedelic dungeon crawling, the stabbing of assorted gribblies, and lots of little details that make you go “ooo, that’s nice. I’m glad they put that in there.”

                              <span>The developers who remade Half-Life as Black Mesa are working on a new roguelite co-op shooter. It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In Rogue Point the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth. Which is where your team of renegade shooterists come in. They don&#x27;t want to win this contest, they just want everyone else to lose.

A successor to the translucent version that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.

                              <span>Great God Grove is, in a word, bonkers. I’ve stopped a small community from completing a blood ritual, played the role of matchmaker to a group of lonely hearts that involved organising a date with god, and plastered a statue with paint as part of a revolutionary movement to uplift the power of art. My time with GGG has been a pick n’ mix of colourful escapades, and together with its story of godly woes, striking art style, vacuum-based puzzle-solving, and nightmare-inducing puppet work, I’m now a die-hard LimboLane devotee.

But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel&#x27;s development back in 2004. Rolling Stone interviewed two key designers of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children&#x27;s book about a nice elephant.

                              <span>Let’s try and get you up to speed on the fascinating oddity that is simulation game Ecosystem, on the off chance that Nate&#x27;s coverage of it hasn&#x27;t stuck with you like an unwelcome brain parasite you’re nonetheless unwilling to get removed for fear of the lingering emptiness it might cause (he once described an eel as “a quaver with erectile dysfunction”).

                              <span>Good news, everyone: I&#x27;m off work all this week. I know, I know - a whole seven days with zero Edwin bullshit. What a prospect. Allow yourself a moment to savour the idea. I&#x27;m so thrilled for you! The Maw, sadly, does not understand the concept of &quot;time off&quot;. Its hunger is as constant as the tide, as unrelenting as my retreating hairline. So before I disappear into a beam of sunshine, here&#x27;s this week&#x27;s list of new PC game releases.

                              <span>My brain is still thawing for the comment freeze, and thus there is sadly no cool industry person to talk to us about books this week. I&#x27;m currently reading Tony Tulathimutte’s Rejection. Jia Tolentino wrote about it for the New Yorker. Jia Tolentino also writes very good books. But enough about books, tell me about books! One&#x27;s you&#x27;ve read, preferably, but I will also accept books you&#x27;ve formed opinions on based on their covers, as is good and proper. Book for now!

                              <span>November 8th, 2005 was my first day as a full-time games journalist, which means I have now entered my 20th year of doing this. &quot;This&quot; has changed a lot over time: from producing CD and DVD coverdiscs, to writing for a magazine, to editing magazines and a website, to solely editing a website, to managing several websites. Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and &quot;games journalist&quot; doesn&#x27;t really cover it. 

One of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games. 

Dapper gent Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon about the fan reboot of City Of Heroes. We briefly covered fans getting an official license earlier this year, but Oli went and spoke to the folks making it all work.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

All of which is my cup of giblets. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)</span>

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.
