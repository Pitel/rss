For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.

PAX East 2023 is currently taking place and our American-based video producer Zion has kept himself busy over the past few days checking out the latest and greatest releases.
One, in particular, he got some time to sit down with was the upcoming Marvelous / XSEED title Story Of Seasons: A Wonderful Life - a remake of the 2003 GameCube title Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. Not only did Zion get time to go hands on with the title, but he&#x27;s also been able to share his early thoughts and impressions with Austin in the video above.

The demise of the 3DS and Wii U eShops has had many of us reminiscing on the days not too long ago when those digital stores were in their prime — as well as firing those stores up on their respective consoles to make sure we have all the games we want before they disappear for good on 27th March.

While many are rightly lamenting the upcoming death of the 3DS eShop, we feel like fewer gamers are pouring one out for the Wii U digital store. Maybe it&#x27;s just us, but we can&#x27;t let that stand, as the console actually had some darn good games — some of which are still exclusives to this day.

The 3DS eShop is closing down, after over a decade of service. It&#x27;s not a huge surprise, but it is a huge bummer, because that means that we only have until 27th March 2023 to purchase some of the best games on the console — the ones that were only ever available on the 3DS eShop.

LEGO 2K Drive got announced for the Nintendo Switch earlier this week and if you have been wondering about whether or not there&#x27;ll be an option to spend money on the game, it seems there will be.

It seems Sega&#x27;s official microsite for the game mentions how there&#x27;ll also be a few bug fixes.

Good morning, good friends, and welcome back to Whatcha Been Playing? You join me at the end of a difficult and emotionally taxing week and, in a bid to get away from it all for even a short while, I am currently on a choo-choo-train, heading out of town for a brief change of scenery and socials. I hope that your week has been good to you and yours, and that this weekend brings you a lot of joy and happiness.
And if you&#x27;re similarly struggling, it&#x27;s ok. Sometimes you aren&#x27;t winning the race, but the track is long, and we&#x27;re all cheering you on from the sidelines. So just ease off the pace, and go easy on yourself. You&#x27;ll get there. However your week has been, you&#x27;re very welcome here, among the greatest community in gaming. Now let&#x27;s have at it.

                              <span>Microsoft’s $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard inched closer in a big way on Friday. UK regulators announced a provisional finding that the acquisition wouldn’t harm competition, despite previously suggesting the Xbox maker might need to spin-off the Call of Duty business to get the sale approved.

It’s especially difficult to pit the games against each other when you consider that the post-nuclear franchise has undergone a couple of genre changes through…

                              <span>Join us for another PAX East game highlight straight from the show floor, and this time we decided to revisit a cult horror classic: Alone In The Dark. This psychological horror is being developed by Pieces Interactive with publishing backing from THQ Nordic and is a love letter to the original game released back in the 90s.
As someone who had played the original, and RPS&#x27; Resident Evil uber fan, Liam decided to check out the demo and you can hear his impressions in the video below:
According to the devs at the THQ booth, this demo is a stand-alone prequel story that will not be in the final game, but shares the same eerie atmosphere and action that&#x27;ll be in the main game. This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you&#x27;ll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had our eyes on Goodbye Volcano High since it appeared in Sony&#x27;s State Of Play back in February and the demo at PAX East is one of the first times that the devs have placed a game preview in the hands of eager players. I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP&#x27;s teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you&#x27;re interested to know what I thought:
Goodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It&#x27;s part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.
I had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won&#x27;t have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ve done at PAX East. There&#x27;s a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we&#x27;ve chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.
Everything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West&#x27;s multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it&#x27;s nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn&#x27;t feel cramped at all, even with Friday&#x27;s busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.
Some of our favourites included Devolver Digital&#x27;s movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb&#x27;s upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games&#x27; Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.

                              <span>“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we&#x27;ve only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won&#x27;t come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he&#x27;s got no eyes, but don&#x27;t show the audience that. It&#x27;s not intentional, he&#x27;s getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”


Every so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They&#x27;re often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games.

The full game launched today, so by the time you’re done gorging on the remake’s fancy additions, the new mode should be ready. Hopefully, you’re still in the mood to roundhouse kick waves of infected in two weeks&#x27; time.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve already banged on about what a terrible, unhelpful term &quot;metroidvania&quot; is, so let&#x27;s skip past to say that Angel&#x27;s Gear reminds me of the one Castlevania game I&#x27;ve ever played.

It&#x27;s partly the tone: a compelling blend of gothic and biomechanical horror, with a 90s game boy goriness that&#x27;s cartoony enough to feel colourful rather than repulsive. &quot;Camp&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word, but a hint of melodrama gives the story severity without self-seriousness. I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.

                              <span>Everywhere (not to be confused with Everything) was a big fat question mark at last year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. It comes from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by ex-GTA boss Leslie Benzies, and despite its cryptic reveal trailer, AliceB theorised it was some kind of Robloxlike. Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content. To show off what the tools can do, Benzies and the team unveiled MindsEye, an episodic “blockbuster” adventure available inside Everywhere. A game set inside a game, if you will.

Or maybe you’ve gone full Charlie Kelly, consuming tins of cat food found around the island. If so, it’s time for a diet cleanse. Sons Of The Forest’s newest patch adds a demon boss, a new cave system, and tons of other improvements. It’s also nerfing cat food, since it was overpowered and, well, are there actually any cats in the game?

You’ll be running about, snapping pics of chain-smoking crabs, tagging graffiti spots around the city, and just generally having a super chill time, yo. Developer Terri Vellman and music producer Doseone are back behind the scenes, and if you want a taste of the slime (ew), Sludge Life 1 is free to keep until March 31st. On Steam, that is.

It was a fun, nostalgic way to let fans reminisce on the game’s infantile days. Ghost Ship had planned to remove Legacy today - March 23rd - but after fan feedback, they’ve decided to keep Legacy edition around indefinitely.

Maybe not to the battery-sipping, framerate-abundant extent of the very best Steam Deck games, but with the right settings, nu-Resi 4 can keep its burlap sacked head well above 30fps even in its most visually demanding scenes.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Game Developers Choice and IGF Award ceremonies were really heartening stuff. Getting to see so many great developers have their games celebrated by their peers will always warm the old cockles, especially when we celebrated so many of them in our own RPS Advent Calendar at the end of last year. Well, I say &#x27;see&#x27;. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year&#x27;s IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   
It&#x27;s an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it&#x27;s all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day one of PAX East and what better way to kick off our show coverage than highlighting a great indie game! We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It&#x27;s a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.
I had a chat with Demonschool&#x27;s Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game&#x27;s many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game&#x27;s trailer and demo is anything to go by, we&#x27;re in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:

If you&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t yet, set your peepers on Demonschool&#x27;s slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There&#x27;s no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.
We&#x27;ve got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag.

                              <span>One of Sea of Star’s most compelling selling points is the involvement of Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I&#x27;ve been a drummer since I was a kid and I&#x27;m still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…</span>

Throughout your journey through the quaint and totally not dangerous at all Spanish country, you’ll encounter hundreds of enemies. Many will utilize standard melee attacks and grabs to stop you, but almost just as many will have projectiles.

Stream suppliers will face three years in prison and for those who watch them, 5,000 euro fines will be on the table.

Capcom has fully revealed the launch roster for its exciting-looking fighter Street Fighter 6, offering us an 18-strong cast of new and familiar faces, (with a few more fighters already waiting in the wings). It&#x27;s a wicked cast, and the buzz surrounding newcomers such as Marisa, Kimberly, and Jamie seems more fervent among the community than usual, which is a great sign for the new generation.
The overall World Warrior cast is huge, however, and unfortunately, not everybody can make the cut. But it&#x27;s always fun to speculate, and even more fun to see your article splashed on Reddit with people angrily sulking about your opinion. So, for these reasons and more, I think we should take a look at eight characters from the Street Fighter universe who I believe would fi…</span>

Sora has enlisted the help of many Disney and Final Fantasy characters over the years, and Kingdom Hearts summons have provided a great way for players to get the upper hand on the Heartless and Nobodies. With Tinkerbell giving constant healing, and Peter Pan lifting Sora off the ground for some aerial attacks, there were plenty of awesome summons to pool from in order to create this list.
While not all Kingdom Hearts summons are useful (we&#x27;re looking at you, Chicken Little), plenty of them can greatly assist Sora and his friends, both offensively and defensively.
Here are the seven best Kingdom Hearts summons.

                              <span>Everybody do the side-step
A new video from developer Arika appears to tease an update in the works for cult fighting title Fighting EX Layer — The video, which sees Fatal Fury&#x27;s Terry Bogard facing off against FEXL&#x27;s Allen Snider was released by the developer ahead of Japan&#x27;s EVO 2023 tournament, which takes place in April.
The key reasoning behind the new video seems a little obscure as of this writing, though said video was followed up by a newer, better-looking version — suggesting that Arika is currently working on something in regards to the Street Fighter EX spin-off title. The most notable moment of this video sees Allen Snider perform several side steps, Tekken-style. This seems to suggest that a &quot;Dodge&quot; ability might be in the works — which would add a 3D element to the 2.5D fighter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g-lMEydK10o&amp;t
A brief note accompanying the video references EVO Japan, and also asks fans to be patient with the quality of the video and its effects. The summary of this confusing content drop appears to suggest that Arika has something to show us at EVO Japan 2023, and that it might be a Fighting EX Layer update, complete with new mechanics and, potentially, tweaked visuals and special effects. Of course, we will be sure to give you all a heads-up once Arika&#x27;s plan has been properly explained.
Fighting EX Layer launched on PS4 in the summer of 2018. Following a series of free post-release characters, the title would be successful enough to encourage Arika to develop a PC port later that year. In 2021, a complete edition titled Fighting EX Layer Another Dash was released for Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Welcome to the Jungle
Epic Games has revealed the next title that it will be offering up to all Epic Games Store users — From March 30, EGS customers will be able to bag themselves the charming and challenging brawler roguelike, Tunche, completely free of charge.
Released in the fall of 2021 and developed by Peruvian indie outfit LEAP Game Studios, Tunche is a unique blend of screen-based brawler action, married to a challenging roguelike format. It is the tale of an Amazonian tribe who must venture through the rainforest on a pilgrimage to meet the titular jungle god and learn the truth behind a strange and overwhelming aggression that has become part of the flora and fauna of the green labyrinth.

Choosing from one of five unique characters, including the sorcerer, Rumi; the balladeer, Pancho; scrappy bird-boy Quayru; and the beautiful warrior, Nayru — alongside a suspiciously quiet Kid wearing a large Hat — the player must complete run after run through the undergrowth, taking on armies of wild animals, bizarre creatures, and boss characters while progressing their chosen character&#x27;s inate abilities. Tunche features beautiful hand-drawn animation, a distinct art style, and an evocative soundtrack, all while posing a meaty challenge for even hardened brawler fans. If you want the full lowdown, then be sure to check out my full review for Tunche right here.
Tunche will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 30-April 6. Until then, you still have time to pick up current freebiesChess Ultra and the WoW: Ishizuchi DLC.

As part of yesterday&#x27;s Future Games Show presentation, Shiro Unlimited released a new trailer for its gooey psychological horror title Decarnation — In addition, the publisher announced that the title will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch at some point this coming May.
Described as an &quot;intensely emotional story unfolding in a malignant, elaborate setting&quot;, Decarnation uses lo-fi visuals to tell the tale of a Parisian cabaret dancer, Gloria, who is struggling to find her big break, held back by a litany of problems related to her life and career. When a seemingly can&#x27;t-miss opportunity comes her way, Gloria finally realizes that this could be her chance to pull the fraying ends of her life together. But the human mind does not always allow for the best-laid plans, and Gloria&#x27;s spiraling emotions may be about to manifest themselves very real-world nightmares.

Decarnation will blend dramatic role-playing elements with puzzle action and elements of survival to create a uniquely creepy, brain-bending experience. With clear stylistic influences coming from the works of directors such as Satoshi Kon and David Lynch, as well as the familiar trappings of the giallo genre, Decarnation doesn&#x27;t look like it will be standard &quot;OMG Zombies!&quot; horror title — instead reaching a little deeper into the darkness of the human soul, as it twists and bends to deal with the realities of the living, and unloving world.
I&#x27;m keeping several eyes on this... including the ones growing out of my arms.
Decarnation launches this May on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam).

Today sees the release of Capcom&#x27;s long-awaited Resident Evil 4 remake, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms after much hype and hoopla — And it seems that the title is already seeing top-tier levels of success, setting the series&#x27; best-ever player record on PC gaming dashboard, Steam.
According to the Steam database, an amazing 140,240 players were simultaneously logged in and making their way through the Uroboros-infested nightmare earlier today. This number represents the highest amount of Steam user concurrently playing any Resident Evil release at any one time, including previous remakes Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, as well as modern mainline sequels Resident Evil VII: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village.

Clearly, the nostalgia factor of the original Resident Evil 4 — still considered a series highlight some 18 years on from its initial GameCube release — will help drive the new 2023 edition to incredible success. The launch of the highly anticipated title is set to kick off what is expected to be a stellar year for Capcom, with dinosaur hunter Exoprimal and the stellar-looking Street Fighter 6 waiting in the wings for the coming quarters. The publisher will no doubt be quick to let us all know how RE4&#x27;s week one sales work out, as players don the sheepskin coat of Leon S. Kennedy for another trip into a living hell.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam), and Xbox Series X. The additional Mercenaries mode will arrive as a free update on April 7.

                              <span>You DO know Jack
You know the name, and you could&#x27;ve predicted the number — Bandai Namco has released another character trailer for its great-looking fighter Tekken 8, this time focusing on the return of one of the franchise&#x27;s longest-&quot;living&quot; characters: the destructive battle droid, Jack-8.
Jack, as Tekken fans will be fully aware, is essentially the name of numerous characters in the Tekken series, essentially depicted as newly upgraded versions of the original Mishima Zaibatsu robo-soldier. While each successive game has seen Jack&#x27;s visual style and overall sense of technical reliability improve, the character has consistently been a heavy power hitter, taking down his opponents with huge, clubbing blows and an increasingly ridiculous range of weaponry and firepower. Let&#x27;s take a look at Jack-8.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1b4MyA6wPJI&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
From this first glance, Tekken 8&#x27;s Jack-8 model looks incredibly — dare I say — &quot;Cyber&quot;, somehow sporting a more futuristic design while still being oddly archaic in design. Still, despite his new look, our favorite metal man is still more than capable of flattening the opposition with the aforementioned haymakers and axhandles — given an extra boost in the form of explosive detonations on impact. To call it a day, Jack-8 calls in a ridiculously oversized energy cannon, wiping out the enemy, (and almost himself), with a devastating beam of raw power, not dissimilar to Iron Man&#x27;s Proton Cannon from Marvel vs. Capcom.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Lars Alexandersson. We only need see the returning Jun Kazama and the opening salvo of the sequel&#x27;s roster is complete.

                              <span>Five-year case concludes with $5 million settlement
A Kansas court has settled the 2017 case in which a Witchita resident was shot dead by a police detective after officers responded to a fake &quot;hostage situation&quot; taking place at the man&#x27;s house — the result of a &quot;swatting&quot; incident perpetrated by Tyler Barriss and concerning Call of Duty players Shane Gaskill and Casey Viner.
On the evening of December 28, 2017, 28-year-old Andrew Finch was at the house owned by his mother when he noticed police lights flashing directly outside of the residence. Opening the door to investigate the commotion, Finch was shot dead moments later by police detective Justin Rapp. Tragically, Finch was not remotely connected to the incidents that had led the police to his front door that fateful night.

The existence of the not-so-secret LEGO 2K Drive was made official yesterday when LEGO and 2K Games dropped the first trailer for the upcoming racer. Set in the expansive world of Blocklandia, players will step in the racing shoes of a rookie driver as they complete quests, play minigames and take on challengers in ridiculous races. As you can see in the trailer below, split-screen and multiplayer are included in the package.

                              <span>How incredibly precious
Having spent years in development, and having suffered numerous delays, publisher Nacon has finally announced a launch date for its Tolkien adaptation The Lord of the Rings: Gollum — The fantasy adventure title will crawl out of its cave on May 25 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The third-person adventure will tell the tale of the notable Tolkien character Smeagol, better known among LOTR as &quot;Gollum&quot;, after the strange guttural noises that emerge from his esophagus. Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the game will see Gollum embark upon his own odyssey across Middle-Earth, meeting tentative allies and bitter enemies in his pursuit of the core of his being... &quot;The Precious&quot;.
You can check out a new, lengthy gameplay showcase video below.

Developed by Daedalic, this ambitious project has seen several setbacks since its initial reveal way back in the spring of 2019, but is finally on the road to fruition. Offering new LOTR lore, a very different perspective on Middle-Earth, and an intriguing &quot;inner turmoil&quot; mechanic, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum will be nothing if not interesting for Tolkien fans, who will get to experience their favorite universe from the perspective of one of its strangest, saddest, and most conflicted characters.
The Lord of The Rings: Gollum launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox on May 23. A Nintendo Switch edition will follow at a later date.

Today sees the launch of Capcom&#x27;s highly anticipated remake, Resident Evil 4 — And for you zombie poppers fans out there, the publisher has finally announced a launch date for popular co-op mode The Mercenaries, which will arrive as a free update on all platforms Friday, April 7.
Mercenaries is a sometimes-multiplayer mode that first made its debut with the launch of the original GameCube edition of Resident Evil 4, back in 2005. The mode sees player/s battling it out against hordes of enemies against an incredibly strict time limit. Typically, the mode features several characters from the respective Resident Evil title, including side characters and other NPCs. The Mercenaries mode has since appeared in sequels such as Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil 6, and, most recently, Resident Evil Village.
Resident Evil 4 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X platforms.

                              <span>Over here, stranger
The impact that Resident Evil 4 had on the industry can&#x27;t be overstated. Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it&#x27;s an important and well-loved title.
When the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market. Now I know the answer.

If there’s one thing Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet have done well, it’s introducing surprising Tera Raids. Even though the 7-Star Decidueye event returns for round two this weekend, we simultaneously have 5-Star Blissey populating our raid crystals through Sunday. Similar to previous 5-Star events, Blissey can appear with any Tera Type. If you’re afraid this might make Blissey hard to counter, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.
Blissey is less a challenge and more a loot piñata full of Tera Shards. That’s right, we finally have an event that’s handing out one of the scarcest resources in the game like candy! Here’s what you should expect.

24th March 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of The Wind Waker&#x27;s North American launch. To honour the occasion, we have retooled our ranking of all the Zelda games to be governed by each game&#x27;s User Rating on our database, turning it into a dynamic reader-ranked list that re-orders automatically depending on the scores you cumulatively bestow.
In order to rate any of the games on the list below out of 10, logged-in Nintendo Life users can simply tap the &#x27;star&#x27;, assign the game a personal rating, and influence the order below. Enjoy!

Did you know Nintendo Life has its own Discord server? Well, we do. And we&#x27;ve spruced the place up quite a bit to get it all ship shape for all of you lovely readers.
Admittedly, we&#x27;ve had the server for a little while now, letting it sit around and gather dust. But we&#x27;ve been working hard to bring it all up to date as a community hub for all things Nintendo Life (and Nintendo. And video games. And whatever else you fancy).

When it comes to objects found within the universe of Super Mario, it&#x27;s generally best to be somewhat ignorant of their origins. Yes, we might ponder who built the numerous green pipes found within the Mushroom Kingdom and why there are so many question blocks floating about, but really - why worry?
If you&#x27;ve found yourself wondering exactly how 1-Up Mushrooms came to be, then a 1996 Super Mario 64 manga has the answer for you. As highlighted by Supper Mario Broth on Twitter (thanks, Time Extension), it appears that the mushrooms actually grow from Mario&#x27;s dead body.

A new patent related to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been spotted, and its for a new piece of artwork of Link&#x27;s rather weird-looking Master Sword.
The Tears of the Kingdom subreddit has been scrambling for reasons as to why this new piece of art has been patented by Nintendo for any scraps of lore they can find for the upcoming Zelda title (thanks GamesRadar!). The most likely reason is for future merchandise purposes, or you know, perhaps Nintendo is going to release an actual gnarly Master Sword.

For the month before the 3DS and Wii U eShops close for new purchases on 27th March, each day we&#x27;re going to highlight a specific eShop game for one of those consoles and give a short pitch as to why we think it deserves your love and attention — before it&#x27;s too late. The chance to add these to your library will be gone for good soon and, for one reason or another, these eShop-exclusives are close to our hearts.

                              <span>It&#x27;s definitely more Pokémon.
The Pokémon Company has revealed another trailer for its upcoming Pokémon anime, unveiling the project&#x27;s name for the first time, too: Pokémon Horizons.
Sounds neat, right? The new series ditches perpetual 10-year-old Ash Ketchum for newcomers Liko and Roy as they encounter characters like Friede, Captain Pikachu, Amethio, and countless other Pokémon on their journeys. Time will tell whether this new series can bring the goods, but we won&#x27;t have long to find out, since it will be making its debut in Japan on April 14th, 2023.

D4 Enterprise has revealed that it&#x27;s bringing games from its online digital storefront, Project EGG (Engrossing Game Gallery), to Switch in the future. The retro games distribution service acts as a place to play officially emulated rereleases of older Japanese PC, arcade, and console games.
Announcing the news on PR Times Japan (thanks Gematsu), the aim is to bring as many titles as possible to the service on Switch. It&#x27;s not known whether this service will be coming west or not at the moment, but we sure hope so, as this is pretty big news for retro enthusiasts. D4 Enterprise is currently the sole worldwide distributor of MSX Licensing Corporation.

                              <span>There’s no plaice like home.
New Zealand indie studio Black Salt’s Dredge surfaced in a highly mysterious trailer in 2022. All we saw was a small boat chugging around torrid seas, terrorised by Lovecraftian looming skies and giant, tentacled monsters. A later trailer showed a fisherman catching ever larger fish, selling them for ever larger amounts of money, and upgrading his boat as he went. Those ideas together sum up Dredge: a fish-sell-upgrade loop in a foreboding horror-mystery setting. It’s the latest thing to be washed up on the shores of iconic indie publisher Team17 – but is it just tragic flotsam, or is it some kind of cool mutant merman thing?
We’re happy to report that it’s very much the latter. Although the core loop is not the most original, the set dressing of cosmic fear, ferocious monsters and terrifyingly plumbable depths make all the difference. The story begins with a fisherman running afoul of jagged rocks. Despite being at the foot of a lighthouse, the rocks seem to appear from nowhere. The mayor of the nearby town loans the fisherman a boat and introduces him to the local fish market and shipyard. And here you take the helm. Controlling your little vessel with left-stick tank controls, you seek out bubbling spots on the water&#x27;s surface. A brief action sub-mini-game moment catches fish, and then you can pootle on back to the dock to sell your haul of tiddlers. Upgrading at the shipyard gets new rods for catching more varied fishies from further afield and all in all it’s a jolly old time in the salty sun on the ocean wave. Until nighttime.

The UK and EU My Nintendo Stores have the NSO Nintendo 64 pads in stock at the time of writing. Purchases are limited to four per person. If you&#x27;ve been waiting for these hard-to-get controllers to come back in stock, now&#x27;s the time to jump on them.

                              <span>All your questions answered, including &quot;BUT WHY&quot;.
It&#x27;s been over a decade, but it&#x27;s finally happening: Nintendo is closing down the Wii U and 3DS eShops, meaning that very soon you will no longer be able to buy digital games on either platform.
This change takes place until March 27th, 2023, which means there&#x27;s still time (just) for you to grab all the downloadable games you can fit in your digital arms and run. But with credit card payment support having ended on May 23rd, 2022, and Nintendo eShop cards having ceased to redeem from August 29th, 2022, we want to make sure that you get those games in time, and don&#x27;t run into any lack-of-fund-related mishaps.

                              <span>Men Of War 2 doesn&#x27;t do anything by half measures, as I discovered during a recent tussle with its online multiplayer modes. Whereas Relic&#x27;s recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That&#x27;s a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that&#x27;s before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it&#x27;s a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. 
Crucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let&#x27;s face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we&#x27;re here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here&#x27;s my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.

I wasn’t really away that Final Fantasy 11 was still running, but the MMO has been chugging along quietly for a few years - its last expansion having arrived in 2013. After 20 years of support, however, Square Enix is putting Final Fantasy 11 in maintenance mode, meaning servers will stay up and it’ll remain playable, but with limited support.

There’s much more in the version 1.09 update besides – the patch notes list plenty of balance changes and bug fixes – but given the sheer amount of time the new ray tracing features have been in the works, not to mention the fact that Elden Ring has never exactly been an exemplar of technical reliability, I wanted to focus in on &#x27;em and see what performance is like on PC.

We kind of end up on an &quot;who tf knows?&quot; but do manage to boil it down into a cowboy metaphor that helps us get a grip on things.
We talk about all that stuff for so long that we end up overrunning and don&#x27;t have time for A Good Day To Ware Hard, or Nate&#x27;s Tower Of Jocularity - although he promises a titanic one next week. We do get in our what games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and it&#x27;s a varied selection.

The game features co-op, multiplayer modes, and the ability to transform between air and land vehicles, Team Sonic Racing-style. The downside? Its collection of pre-order bonuses probably needs a graph of some kind to understand.

                              <span>Epic Games held their State Of Unreal presentation last night, where they talked about the new tech coming to Unreal Engine 5.2, unveiled Fortnite’s Creative 2.0 mode, and debuted new looks at upcoming UE5-developed games such as Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. The first hack-and-slashing adventure already had pretty lifelike faces, but the spooky sequel is taking things a step further with some frighteningly realistic tech.

                              <span>Something terrible lurks beneath the waves in Dredge. Actually, scratch that. There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn&#x27;t possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I&#x27;ve only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They&#x27;re forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you&#x27;ll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that&#x27;s white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. 
It&#x27;s unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that&#x27;s the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you&#x27;ll find in Davy Jones&#x27; locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes. Yes, you will be frightened of what&#x27;s out there, whether it&#x27;s real or born from your own fearful imaginings, but you&#x27;ll sputter out into the darkness regardless, because the allure of this supernatural fishing sim is just too good to resist.

                              <span>Epic Games have married their two money makers, creating holy matrimony between battle-royale mainstay Fortnite and Unreal Engine 5. As part of the company’s State Of Unreal presentation, Epic unveiled Unreal Editor For Fortnite (UEFN), a UE5-powered version of the game’s Creative mode which the community has been referring to as Creative 2.0 for the past few months. UEFN is out right now in beta form, and some of what’s possible with these tools are downright wild.

Thankfully, we&#x27;ve started to see a host of discounts on CPU and motherboard combos, including this one from Newegg that bundles a Ryzen 5 7600 CPU and MSI Pro B650M-A WiFi motherboard for $324.99, an $84 savings compared to buying both separately.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is one of the best value PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market, offering high speeds - up to 5150MB/s reads and 4900MB/s writes - while also being surprisingly cheap. 
It normally costs around £90 for a 1TB unit, but now you can pick one up from Amazon UK for only £65.58, a 27% discount that brings it down to just 6.5p per gigabyte.

The developer took action after the Motion Picture Association targeted the open-source Android app in a complaint filed at GitHub. The MPA hasn&#x27;t contacted the developer directly but the Hollywood group considers Cloudstream a prime enforcement target.

For all the good that Nintendo brings into the world with its wonderful creations, it&#x27;s clear there are still some areas where the company could be doing better. One crucial area where the company has failed for as long as it&#x27;s been a household name is continuing access to legacy games. Since the NES was dropped in favor of the SNES, Nintendo fans have had to hold onto old hardware if they wanted to keep playing their favorite games from the previous generation. It hasn&#x27;t always tripped up with this as anyone who kept playing their OG copy of Tetris on the Game Boy Advance SP can attest to. But with the advent of digital marketplaces, the company has found new and exciting ways to keep people from buying and playing games from old consoles.

Sony Interactive Entertainment and Guerilla Games have opened pre-orders on Burning Shores, the incoming DLC expansion for the gorgeous adventure title Horizon Forbidden West — And to help entice folks to get on board, the developer has revealed an attractive skin for all pre-order customers.
Anyone who pre-orders Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores on PS5 will receive an exclusive Blacktide Dye Outfit and a matching Blacktide Dye Bow. Very snazzy. The items can be unlocked in-game once Aloy visits the first Dye Merchant in the new expansion. You can check out the gear in the trailer below, which also offers up a brand new look at Burning Shores&#x27; suspiciously familiar world.

Picking up from the finale of Forbidden West, Burning Shores will follow the intrepid Aloy as she ventures forth into a brand new region, located south of the Tenakth Clan Lands. There, our young hero will explore new locales, meet new allies and enemies, and confront a new variety of the mechanical monstrosities known as The Machines. Fans can expect the same sense of wonder and awe that has become Horizon&#x27;s identity.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms and the Burning Shores DLC will launch on PS5 only on April 19.

Remember Sonic Origins? Well its back...in Plus form! In a seemingly make-good effort (doesn&#x27;t seem like enough!), Sega is adding an expansion pack (that&#x27;s $9.99 as an expansion, or $39.99 as a standalone that includes Sonic Origins) that has a few content additions that a lot of Sonic fans might enjoy. The big takeaway? Amy Rose is playable in Sonic 1, 2, 3 + Knuckles and Sonic CD. The plussed-up Plus will also add new modes, animations, music, and other aesthetic options.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Sega:

With the impending release of Rainmaker Productions&#x27; port of Assault Suit Valken: Declassified, I got the opportunity to talk with the development director of the project, Masanori Yagi, at the legendary developer M2. M2 has been in the porting business since 1993’s Gauntlet IV for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Since then it has grown to be one of the most respected developers for porting games to new hardware.
Rainmaker Productions approached M2 to port Assault Suit Valken to modern consoles with the purpose of providing a version that was re-translated and uncensored. In 1993, The North American version was published by Konami for the SNES as Cybernator. While the game itself was largely unchanged, character portraits were removed, text was cut, and a rather gris…</span>

                              <span>He of Billowing Pants returns
SNK has released a new trailer for the next fighter headed to its great 2022 release The King of Fighters XV — And, for KoF fans, this boy needs no introduction, as spring will see the return of one of the most notable, stoic, and JUSTICE-ridden characters in SNK history, the taekwondo king: Kim Kaphwan!
Having made his debut in 1992&#x27;s Fatal Fury 2, Kim fast became one of the universe&#x27;s most reliable and beloved characters, as well as one of the KoF franchise&#x27;s most solid fighters. Hailing from South Korea, Kim utilizes his incredible martial arts abilities to better the world, bestowing a sense of honor into all he meets and ensuring justice is seen to be done for those who have strayed from a path of enlightenment. Kim&#x27;s role in KoF famously saw his endless efforts to rehabilitate criminals Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan. Despite his boy scout nature, Kim is a respected character among the SNK community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;FO_GppPzlig&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SNKOFFICIAL
As the above trailer demonstrates, Kim is bringing his iconic and acrobatic range of kicks to the King of Fighters XV party, including his range of devastating flying axe kicks, his gravity-defying headstomps, and his incredible, lightning-speed Supers. Sadly, Kim&#x27;s iconic pants aren&#x27;t quite as billowy as they were in his 2D days, but anybody picking up Kim as DLC will at least receive his classic costume as a bonus skin. Kim Kaphwan will be available this spring, with further characters expected later in 2023.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Almost Unreal
As part of this week&#x27;s Game Developer Conference (GDC) publisher Epic Games and developer Team Ninja has shone the light on the stunning facial animation tech that will be used to bring life and personality to the characters of long-in-development sequel Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II.
The demonstration video shows off Unreal Engine&#x27;s &quot;Metahuman&quot; technology, and features the face of actor Melina Juergens, who portrays the troubled Senua in the Hellblade series. The video begins with an extreme close-up of Senua&#x27;s eyes, slowing pulling back as she delivers a dramatic monologue, before finally being lost in flickering flame. While the blending of reality and digital effects will almost always contain some element of the infamous &quot;Uncanny Valley&quot;, it can&#x27;t be denied that the technology is mightily impressive.

&quot;This cloud-hosted tool allows you to create photorealistic digital humans for your game or experience, with the simplicity of an RPG character creator, yet with a level of realism and customization that you’ve never seen before,&quot; says Epic Games&#x27; chief technology officer Kim Librerim.
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II was first announced back in 2019, with only scant updates and previews offered on the grim-looking sequel. Given Hellblade II&#x27;s core approach to psychological horror and deep, emotive characters, the Metahuman tech will allow the developers to best capture Juergens as she delivers what is expected to be another stellar lead performance. Should it be a success, we can likely expect to see other character-focused adventures experiment with the next-gen tech.
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>It&#x27;s $49.99
If you forgot Voice of Cards existed, well I have some news for you! There&#x27;s actually three separate Voice of Cards games, all with different subtitles. While we reviewed The Isle Dragon Roars over a year ago, two more entries have released since then. As of this morning (thanks John!) a bundle has appeared on the Nintendo Switch eShop, which collects all three of them in one neat digital package.
The package is $49.99, and includes all three games. Described as a &quot;quirky series of RPGs where the whole world is depicted through the medium of cards&quot; (which is fairly apt!), this subseries has been gaining some traction in select communities, with the power of Square Enix-backed art behind it. Let&#x27;s dig into what this bundle actually entails.
Does the Voice of Cards trilogy bundle save you any money or include the DLC?
Let&#x27;s take a look at what the current prices are on the eShop if you bought each Voice of Cards game piecemeal, compared to the $49.99 bundle:
The Isle Dragon Roars - $29.99
The Forsaken Maiden - $29.99
Beasts of Burden - $29.99
So uh, you could say it saves you quite a bit! Of course there is DLC afoot for the series (it is Square Enix), but you&#x27;re getting all three core games with the bundle.
About that: there is another Trilogy + DLC set bundle for $64.99 if you want to go all-in. Here&#x27;s what the DLC entails, straight from Square Enix: &quot;the designs of in-game items such as cards, playing pieces and tables to be styled after the games from the NieR series, DLC that changes the game music and DLC that changes the visuals for all characters and enemies to a pixel art style.&quot;
Voice of Cards is also present on PS4, PC, and mobile devices, if you don&#x27;t want to dump all the cash required on the Switch bundle.

I’m not sure I ever made it past the second mission in Cybernator as a kid, but it left an impact all the same. Released in Japan in 1992 as Assault Suit Valken for Super Famicom, it was the second in the Assault Suit series after Assault Suit Leynos. Aside from being about mecha, the two games seemed to have different approaches to design. While Leynos was a rather straightforward side-scroller, Assault Suit Valken had a more tangibly weighty and methodical approach. There was an odd sense of realism to its fantastic sci-fi themes.
However, its release as Cybernator by Konami on the SNES was somewhat compromised. The translation wasn’t the best, character portraits were removed, and the ending was censored. Rainmaker Productions seeks to rectify that with Assault Suit Valk…</span>

                              <span>Diving for Atari gold
Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to purchase retro restoration developer Nightdive Studios. The chairman of Atari reportedly already owned a 13% minority stake in Nightdive, and the deal is for Atari to buy up 100% of the shares.
Nightdive Studios has long been a well-regarded developer of ports of older PC titles. Some of these endeavors have resulted in full source ports, as was the case in the move of Power Slave to their proprietary KEX Engine. Currently, Nightdive is working on a complete refurbishment of System Shock, which is slated for release May 30.
For Atari’s part, it has largely been pushing modernized versions of its legacy library with games like Yars: Recharged, which I haven’t played, but I can’t imagine it being much worse than 2011’s Yars Revenge reimagining. The company has been pretty shaky for years, though their reproduction of Atari games on authentic cartridges shows some respect for their properties, and the recent team-up with Digital Eclipse on the Atari 50 collection has yielded one of the best retro compilations in years. Maybe they’re turning a new leaf, and Nightdive will help steer them on a good path. Who knows?
I’m trying to be optimistic. I have a lot of respect for Nightdive and not much for Atari. It’s like seeing your sibling hook up with the guy who’s best known for pooping himself in gym class. I’m trying to be optimistic. Maybe Atari’s pooping days are behind them. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.
I reached out to Larry Kuperman, Director of Business Development at Nightdive Studios. He commented, &quot;A major factor in choosing to partner with Atari is that Nightdive will be able to continue our mission to bring back lost classics, but with greater resources available.&quot;

In addition to semi-regular Tera Raid mix ups and 7-Star raid battles featuring out-of-game guest stars, Game Freak has been shuffling irregular mystery gifts into Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. The newest one involves two TMs (Thunder Wave and Taunt), and just requires a quick mystery gift code input.
Thanks to a new promo drop from Nintendo (credit to Profe Turo on Twitter for screenshotting the source), the code &quot;ENJOYBATTLE&quot; is now live for Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. The code will run through April 30, 2023 at 23:59 UTC, so there&#x27;s plenty of time to redeem it.

Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s on offer in this March Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet mystery gift box:
TM082 - Thunder Wave
TM087 - Taunt
Oh hey, you might want to use taunt in a 7-star raid battle! Look, I know it&#x27;s not super exciting, but it&#x27;s something some of you may want to redeem. I&#x27;m doing my part!
We have a full breakdown on how to access the mystery gift system here. In short, it involves finishing up the tutorial (which requires you to get through the academy portion, after the bout with Arven) to fully unlock the required menu.
Other currently live Pokemon Scarlet and Violet mystery gift codes:

It’s time for my fourth annual review of one of Koei Tecmo’s Atelier games, and I’ve fallen a bit behind. I passed the 20-hour mark in Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key, which has proven insufficient for conjuring a final opinion.
Atelier Ryza 3 (I’m never going to remember the subtitle, so why pretend?) is a mix of old standards and new experiments. It is so strange. It wears an outfit comprised of various poorly fitting garments, and I am fighting with myself to discover whether I think that’s an overall good or bad thing.

Elden Ring, our own Destructoid 2022 Game of the Year, is still cleaning up at various award ceremonies. Just this week it managed to snag another overall GOTY win out of GDC, which announced their full list of winners last night. While God of War Ragnarok ended up taking the &quot;audience award,&quot; Elden Ring beat it out for the top prize.
For context, this is the full list of GDC best overall nominees that Elden Ring had to compete with
Elden Ring
God of War Ragnarok
Immortality
Pentiment
Stray
Tunic
Elden Ring also won the best visual art award, but God of War won the most awards overall with three (best audio, audience award, best technology). It&#x27;s a fairly well-rounded list, packed with 2022 favorites and several indie releases. While indies can win …</span>

Anecdotally, one of the most common complaints I hear about The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker is that there was too much time spent sailing. That’s completely valid. I get it, not everyone is fine with looking at the ass end of a boat for large slabs of time, but for me, that was one of my favorite parts.
Dredge marries the ass end of a boat with horror. I love horror. I moved onto it after I explored so many depressing games that I eventually reached the other end of them and realized it was a cliff. So, rather than jump off that cliff, I turned around and meandered through the bramble field of horror. Let’s ignore this obvious cry for help and take a look at Dredge instead.

On March 28, MLB The Show 23 will be out on the Nintendo Switch eShop, and I&#x27;m extremely curious what the breakdown is in terms of who buys sports games on the Switch versus every other platform (especially newer current-gen consoles). But I&#x27;m sure no one wants to hear about that, as there&#x27;s plenty of other stuff on offer on the Switch in the near future (and a lot going away on the 3DS and Wii U, RIP).
Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key (what a title!) is out on March 24, and Storyteller is out now. The &quot;most interesting game of the week&quot; award goes to 12 Labours Of Hercules VII: Fleecing The Fleece; not only because it&#x27;s actually the seventh entry in the 12 Labours of Hercules series, but because of this choice description straight from the publisher:…</span>

                              <span>A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon&#x27;s interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it&#x27;s planned for later this year. Alongside today&#x27;s news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol.&quot; 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

                              <span>Arkane Studios, best known for creating the acclaimed stealth series Dishonored, has made a name for itself by realizing game worlds with rich lore, environmental storytelling, and curious, interweaving levels. Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

                              <span>Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection&#x27;s initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails&#x27; Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don&#x27;t already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

                              <span>Theatrhythm Final Bar Line is already home to more than 380 songs, but soon, five more, this time from the Nier series, will be added to the game&#x27;s playable soundtrack. 
The Nier: Automata tracks &quot;Dependent Weakling,&quot; &quot;Weight of the World Kowaretasekainouta – Marina Kawano,&quot; &quot;Amusement Park,&quot; &quot;A Beautiful Song,&quot; And &quot;Emil&#x27;s Shop,&quot; will be added to the game on March 29.

The wait is NieRly over!
@NieRGame Series pack for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line will launch on March 29th with the following songs:

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Your Ocean,&quot; &quot;World is Yours,&quot; &quot;Breaking Free,&quot; &quot;Twister,&quot; and &quot;Calling.&quot; Song packs typically cost $3 to $6 depending on the pack, but you&#x27;ll get all of these NEO songs and all of these Nier songs if you&#x27;ve purchased Season Pass 1. 
We love the game, and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Theatrhythm Final Bar Line review.

                              <span>During Summer Game Fest last June, Alien fans were treated to the reveal of a new title called Aliens: Dark Descent. The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn&#x27;t seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The Lego Group and 2K have revealed Lego 2K Drive, a new open-world racing game launching this May. 
More specifically, Lego 2K Drive hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 19. The game is being developed by WWE 2K and NBA 2K studio, Visual Concepts, and is reminiscent of Forza Horizon&#x27;s open-world exploration mixed with Mario Kart-like racing. If you&#x27;re wondering how we know that, it&#x27;s because we went hands-on with it for a few hours recently, and you can read our preview of the game right now. 
Check out the game in action below: 


Lego 2K Drive is the first collaboration between the Lego Group and 2K but not the last because it is the start of &quot;a multi-title partnership between 2K and the Lego Group to develop AAA Lego games.&quot;

                              <span>Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it&#x27;s easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it. 


&quot;In addition, Atari, SA also announced that it intends to proceed in the near-term with a €30 million bond issue co…</span>

                              <span>Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, &quot;We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, &#x27;No PlayStation 5. Now we&#x27;re gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.&#x27;&quot;


Smith said Arkane didn&#x27;t mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
&quot;Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,&quot; Smith told IGN France. &quot;And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.&quot; 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it&#x27;s par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it&#x27;s also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2.

                              <span>Last fall, a court of appeals in the Netherlands ruled that internet provider Ziggo is not required to forward piracy warnings to its subscribers. The ruling was a setback for local anti-piracy group BREIN, which wanted to warn frequent uploaders without knowing who they are. BREIN now says that it won&#x27;t take the dispute to the Supreme Court, which might actually be bad news for pirates.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game&#x27;s darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game&#x27;s grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it&#x27;s a trailer released as part of today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation, it&#x27;s less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it&#x27;s due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review after that.

                              <span>Ninja Theory revealed Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what&#x27;s to come in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it&#x27;s a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll be playing the game, though. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice review and then head to our Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hub for more information about this upcoming sequel.

                              <span>Valve has revealed Counter-Strike 2 and it will be released this summer. 
An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will &quot;be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release.&quot; 
The company also says, &quot;Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike&#x27;s history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come.&quot;
Alongside today&#x27;s reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features &quot;available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate.&quot; There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player&#x27;s CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

News on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games&#x27; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game&#x27;s reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 
According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game&#x27;s reveal trailer), Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 could be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the b…</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed Ghostwriter yesterday, marketed as an AI development tool (really just machine learning) that generates first drafts of NPC barks, which are the offhand remarks you might hear when running past NPCs. Skyrim’s “I used to be an adventurer like you” is probably the most famous example of a bark. Ubisoft Ghostwriter has been met with passionately negative responses from some narrative designers, while others have been arguing for its use cases.

                              <span>Storyteller is a make-your-own drama puzzle game, taking place on the pages of a book and within empty comic-ish panels on those pages. For each puzzle you&#x27;re given a set of characters and scenarios (the Baron, the Knight, the Queen; a wedding, a kidnap, an execution) and are tasked with arranging them in a combination that fits the story title you&#x27;re given (The Queen Marries). It&#x27;s playful and cute, with surprising depth that draws inspiration from classic stories. It&#x27;s also very short. I&#x27;d wager you&#x27;ll have hunnerpercented Storyteller in two hours max, which will sound like mana from heaven to some, but may disappoint you if you&#x27;ve been waiting for Storyteller for over a decade.

                              <span>Arkane’s upcoming co-op shooter found itself in hot water when fans heard of Redfall&#x27;s always-online requirement, even when playing alone. This deflated some longtime Arkane fans since their other immersive sims - between Dishonoured, Prey, and Deathloop - had either no online functionality or were still playable offline. Thankfully, in an interview with Eurogamer, game director Harvey Smith said the team are now working to U-turn the decision.

                              <span>Netflix’s take on chonky soldiers vs. equally chonky underground aliens is, excuse me, gearing up. Last November, the streaming service announced plans to adapt Gears Of War’s chainsaw-swinging into an animated series and a live-action film. The latter has now tapped a writer. Jon Spaihts is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Dune, Prometheus, and Doctor Strange, and he’s now writing the Gears Of War film, Netflix announced today.

An underground volcano lair. A Smaug-pleasing gold hoard, conveniently adjacent to a finance executive’s office. Who’d have guessed, then, that its absolute best fight – not just a thrilling brawl in itself, but the point at which a stumbling adventure plants its feet back in greatness – would take place in a canteen?

                              <span>Remember when Arkane said their co-op vampire &#x27;em up Redfall is more akin to Far Cry than Left 4 Dead? I do! I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I&#x27;d played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.
Well, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane&#x27;s magic wasn&#x27;t diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;m itching to play it again.

Over the past few days, Capcom have released two 1-minute episodes of the Resident Evil 4 anime Masterpiece Theatre called Leon And The Mysterious Village, a childlike take on the classic gothic journey. It’s beautifully animated and hilarious, even without context for Resi4. The only problem? These shorts are too damn short!

Doki Doki Literature Club was already scary enough for a dating sim, but our Graham has found something just as creepy. Tax Heaven 3000 is an upcoming dating sim that apparently prepares your US federal tax returns and asks you for personal information like your social security number - all while giving you a cheerful waifu to romance. Her name’s - wait for it - Iris. As in the IRS, aka the government branch responsible for taxes. Sigh.

Spiritually rather than biologically, of course. If you’re not sold yet, Miasma Chronicles will be showing up to tomorrow&#x27;s Future Games Show.

Low framerates, stuttering, lighting glitches, texture popping, wonky shaders... if you could think of a technical woe, it was probably already undermining this remaster’s efforts to rework and enhance the original RPG’s visuals.
Publishers Private Division have since promised a series of updates to get the Spacer’s Choice Edition up to code, with the first of these – v1.1 – releasing late last week. I’ve given it a test on various graphics cards and credit where it’s due, it has bumped up general performance significantly, although many broken parts remain unmended.

                              <span>In our sixth episode, the Indiescovery gang belatedly turn our attention to the question of just what the heck we&#x27;re doing here anyway. The issue of &quot;what makes an indie game an indie game?&quot; is full of twists and turns, and nobody has ever really come up with an answer that covers all the bases. Lucky for us, that&#x27;s not really what we&#x27;re talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.
Instead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we&#x27;re thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil&#x27;s advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep. (What can I say, I never saw a fence I didn&#x27;t want to touch just to see if it&#x27;s electrified.)

The bad news is that it will use blockchain technology, after CCP received $40 million (around £32.7 million) from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

                              <span>As of today, Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom and all its DLC are available via Xbox Game Pass. Level-5&#x27;s JRPG is set long after the events of the first game, has a new cast of characters, changes up combat a lot, and adds a sizeable kingdom management element to the game. I know people who like it and people who hate it, which in itself makes it interesting.

There are also a bunch of games leaving Game Pass at the end of the month, including Chinatown Detective Agency.

                              <span>Jake Solomon was a longtime designer and director at studio Firaxis, and he was pretty publicly the figurehead for big strategy games like XCOM 2 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns. So last month, it was pretty big news to hear he was leaving Firaxis behind to chase a “new dream.” At the time, it was unclear what that dream was, but thanks to a podcast interview with My Perfect Console (spotted and transcribed by VGC) we now have an idea of what Solomon will do next. It involves opening a new studio and working on strategy games, unlike the ones he made at Firaxis.

                              <span>Remakes are all the rage these days. It feels like every classic from Resident Evil 4 to Final Fantasy 7 is getting a shiny facelift, reimagining the polygonal blocks from yesteryear and turning them into scarily realistic blockbusters. But, every so often I get an itch. An itch to go back in time to my low-detail-graphics childhood, sitting on the floor, looking up at a squared CRT. And that’s what a good demake is for; specifically, the Dead Space Demake.

                              <span>After playing a short snippet of Tchia back in January for a preview, I had complete faith that developers Awaceb would deliver on their promises for their open-world adventure. Tchia’s island is a marvel to behold. Not only is it gorgeous, but it’s bursting with things to do: sailing, climbing, totem carving, gliding, pearl diving, sharpshooting, tree hopping, treasure hunting - the list goes on and on. 
Not only that, but there’s a 10-hour story to follow, quests to complete, and baddies to tussle with. It&#x27;s a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game&#x27;s incredible scope doesn&#x27;t feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We&#x27;ve had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I&#x27;m more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.

But it seems we might need to wait a while more to see the untitled project, as it looks like it&#x27;s getting rebooted to start development from scratch.

                              <span>Hurray for game preservation: Cart Life is coming back to Steam later this year. You might remember the retail sim as the monochromatic indie from 2010 about three street vendors who struggle to make ends meet. It was a kind of precursor to Papers, Please, and despite critical acclaim and big wins at IGF, Cart Life’s creator Richard Hofmeier removed the game from Steam almost a decade ago - instead opting to release the source code for free.

However, we&#x27;re missing the fifth place NAND flash memory manufacturer, another brand that creates their own flash memory and controllers: SK Hynix, or as their consumer brand is labelled, Solidigm (meant to rhyme with paradigm for some reason). 
I recently upgraded a laptop I&#x27;m testing with their P44 Pro 1TB drive, and I&#x27;ve been thrilled with its performance - and now, this drive has hit a scorchingly hot price on Amazon US. You can now pick up this drive for just $69.99 after a 44% discount from its US MSRP of $124.99, an incredible price for a high-end PCIe 4.0 drive.

                              <span>Music streaming apps like Spotify offer more than 100 million tracks but for some, nothing sounds better than leaked, unreleased music. &#x27;Unreleased Sounds&#x27; is a site dedicated to this type of content and already linked to many high-profile leaks. After an artist, linked to Avicii, asked fans not to buy &quot;stolen&quot; music last year, the RIAA now wants to know who&#x27;s behind the site.

                              <span>A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts &quot;a master storyteller.&quot; The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

We still have no release window for the project, and given that they&#x27;ve only just attached a writer, it&#x27;s probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie&#x27;s existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

                              <span>Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season&#x27;s pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings &quot;Blocky&quot; skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you&#x27;ve played 2021&#x27;s Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer&#x27;s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

                              <span>Cal Kestis’ desperate fight against the Empire is the centerpiece of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and a new story trailer provides a peek into his struggle as well as the allies, old and new, helping him. 
The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years&#x27; worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.</span>

                              <span>Shortly after the launch of Sonic Frontiers late last year, Sega and Sonic Team unveiled a 2023 roadmap that includes three significant content releases over the course of the year. Now that we&#x27;re three months into the calendar, Sonic Team is ready to release the first of the three updates this week. 
This first content release of 2023 is called &quot;Sights, Sounds, and Speed&quot; and adds content across three areas of the game. First up, new challenge modes, which can be accessed after you complete the main story campaign, give you access to Cyber Space Challenge and Battle Rush via the title screen. Cyber Space Challenge is a time-attack mode where you play through several of the game&#x27;s linear Cyber Space stages in rapid succession with the goal of scoring the best time. Battle Rush is the same …</span>

                              <span>From Software celebrated the one-year anniversary of Elden Ring last month and now, publisher Bandai Namco has released some fun statistics covering what players have done in 365 days of Elden Ring. 
Starting with the least surprising statistic, players have attempted to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, a colossal 329 million times. In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts. 
If you enjoyed those stats, there are all kinds of other ones in the infographic below – enjoy!

Another day, another horrifyingly cute and disturbing Resident Evil 4 anime short to watch. Earlier this week, Capcom released Episode 1 of its &quot;Resident Evil 4 Anime – Leon and the Mysterious Village,&quot; following it up yesterday with the release of Episode 2. Episode 3 is now available for viewing and it&#x27;s the most gruesome yet (but also, still very cute). 
Enjoy!


The original story continues below...
Update, 3/22/24: 
Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn&#x27;t go well.

                              <span>Developer Angry Mob Games has revealed that its action roguelite platformer, Trinity Fusion, will launch into Early Access next month. 
More specifically, Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on April 13. You can access this Early Access launch via both Steam and the Epic Games Store. In Trinity Fusion, you play as Maya, a cross-dimensional warrior who is able to tap into three versions of herself across parallel dimensions. 
Check out the action all three versions of Maya must face in the multiverse in the new Trinity Fusion trailer below: 


&quot;We have a ton of content in the works for Trinity Fusion,&quot; Angry Mob Games&#x27; Bogdan Iliesiu writes in a press release. &quot;Given the amazing feedback we received from players throughout Steam Next Fest and events like EGX, releasing in Early Access was an easy decision to make. With the Early Access release, we&#x27;ll be able to get that same great feedback on our new biomes, enemies, and bosses on an ongoing basis as we keep adding more for players to explore and fight through.&quot; 
Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 13.

                              <span>Zack Snyder, the director behind &quot;Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,&quot; &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, &quot;Rebel Moon,&quot; is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a &quot;ridiculous scale.&quot; 
&quot;The one thing that I&#x27;m having a really good time with – and I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we&#x27;re doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge,&quot; he said on the podcast, according to VGC. &quot;There&#x27;s more coming, but all I&#x27;ll say is that it was pitched to me – because I&#x27;ve always wanted to do an RPG – like, &#x27;well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.&#x27;
&quot;And I was like, &#x27;ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.&#x27;&quot;
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s going to take so much time, we&#x27;ve got to do all these brain dumps, you&#x27;ve got to tell us everything in the universe, what&#x27;s happening, the science.&quot; And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, &quot;Let&#x27;s go all the way.&quot; 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

                              <span>After almost 17 years online, file-hosting veteran Zippyshare will shut down at the end of the month. Founded in 2006, Zippyshare was known for its free, no-nonsense, no-frills approach to storing files online. Having changed very little over the years, Zippyshare&#x27;s operators say the platform is now a dinosaur that costs too much to run in a world where ad-blocking is widespread.

                              <span>Exciting times! Liam and I have wrapped Inventory Space episode two, in which we documented several weeks of us returning to Bungie’s live service behemoth Destiny 2. We found it to be an FPS delight, but one that’s wrapped in a taxing MMO.
One thing I can’t stop thinking about are the game’s piss-coloured walls. They appear right at the beginning of the game’s latest expansion Lightfall and I genuinely believe they summarise Destiny perfectly.

It&#x27;s a video series in which we spend our precious free time with live service games to see how much they demand from our schedules, and whether we&#x27;re truly able to experience the best of them without crumbling to dust.
So, please join us, as we tackle Bungie&#x27;s FPS behemoth Destiny 2. Was it worth our time? And crucially, is it worth yours?

It also looked beautiful. But what’s actually happening this time around? Well, EA have released a new story trailer for the sequel, catching us up with an older version of the Mantis crew.

                              <span>Want a big-ol&#x27; SSD for your games, media and what-not? The Crucial P3 Plus is currently reduced at Best Buy, where the massive 4TB size is down to $225. That&#x27;s nearly $40 off its previous price and a great value for a drive of this spec. 
For the record, the P3 Plus is a PCIe 4.0 SSD, with up to 5000MB/s reads and 4200MB/s writes. It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer&#x27;s RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we&#x27;d still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice!

                              <span>Earlier this month, Paradox revealed Life By You, a competitor to The Sims led by former EA exec Rod Humble. We only received a snappy 50-second tease of some environments and our non-Sims avatars, but Paradox have now shown more of their life-sim via a live stream, calling it “the most moddable and open life simulator.” We now know that Life By You will have an open world, a dialogue system, a third person-mode, and it’ll release into early access on September 12th.

Last week ZA/UM announced that one of its legal disputes had been resolved and that they expected the rest of their legal troubles to &quot;fall apart.&quot; But fired game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov took the oppurtunity to double down on their lawsuit and dispute the studio&#x27;s claims, calling them &quot;wrong and misleading in several respects.&quot;

                              <span>I rarely enjoy adventure games, and in fact resent them for pinning that term for a genre that almost never feels adventurous. And yet I don&#x27;t quite want to say that 24 Killers is an exception, because confining it to any genre feels reductive, let alone one that will probably put you off if you&#x27;re anything like me.
It&#x27;s a tiny bit like a Stardew Valley or Gleaner Heights, or any of those &quot;do chores until you run out of energy&quot; games, but mostly it&#x27;s a &quot;hanging out and being slightly weird&quot; game.

Liam and I are heading out to Boston this week to play a bunch of awesome indie games, have a gab with developers, attend some cool panels, and generally have a good ol’ snoop around the show floor. And the best thing is that we&#x27;ll be sharing all our PAX escapades with our RPS supporters.

The only way I know spring has in fact sprung is from the other yearly indicators: Easter eggs stacked en masse in the aisles of supermarkets; pictures of bunnies, chicks and daffodils everywhere; and digital storefronts doing seasonal game sales. GOG kicks off their Spring Sale starts today, with literally thousands of games discounted, some up to 90%. It&#x27;s running until April 3rd, and to give you a place to start we&#x27;ve highlighted some of our favourites on our GOG page.

                              <span>Father forgive me, for I have spent the weekend conversing with the damned. No, I haven’t gone all Alan Moore and grimoired up a demonic pal to go gallivanting around the big Tescos with. That is next weekend. Instead, I’ve been playing Diablo 4’s beta, closed to all except an elite cadre of press, pre-orderers, and, uh, chicken enthusiasts. And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.


Mouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness.

I’m guessing playing as a bald half-head that’s been separated from every body part is pretty low on the list, but after seeing the trailer for Henry Halfhead, you’ll probably change your mind. Announced as part of the weekend’s MIX Showcase, Henry Halfhead is an upcoming indie where you take control of the titular half-head (the top half) and possess everyday items to solve puzzles. It’s aiming for a PC release next year, and it just looks delightful.

                              <span>Last year, a group of independent filmmakers obtained a multi-million default judgment against VPN service LiquidVPN, which stood accused of facilitating piracy. Since the owner of the now-defunct service has paid nothing, the movie companies are calling for his arrest. Meanwhile, a waste company has been added to the dispute.

It was a story-building puzzle game in which players constructed three-panel comics by dragging and dropping characters and items such that they combined in delightful, dramatic ways.

                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s pre-order beta is underway. That means people who have already paid for the hack-and-slash sequel are currently enjoying the quintessential modern Diablo experience: queuing to play for hours and being spontaneously disconnected should they manage to enjoy a few moments smashing monsters. 

Blizzard saying they&#x27;re tracking the issues and, as of a couple of hours ago, say that they&#x27;ve applied fixes that have improved wait times.

                              <span>I write this a few days before you&#x27;ll read it, for tomorrow is St Patrick&#x27;s day, which is a bank holiday for me. I believe in Ireland this is traditionally spent destroying green food die, and complaining about Americans calling it &quot;Patty&#x27;s day&quot;, but time will tell. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allowed to play video games, or if that will be some sort of sacrilege, but I&#x27;ll definitely be able to at the weekend, right? The RPS treehouse at large will be sampling a variety of delights, it seems.

BREIN&#x27;s latest annual report covering 2022 reveals that it completed 458 investigations and shut down 449 pirate sites. That&#x27;s 100 more than BREIN reported for 2021. Pirates are clearly persistent but BREIN is always up for the fight.

                              <span>Here&#x27;s a neat trick: if you want a high-end gaming laptop but don&#x27;t want to pay over the odds for it, consider the Corsair Voyager A1600. If you buy it from Corsair&#x27;s US web store, add a PC case like this one and then use code NEWBUILD, you can pick up the laptop and the case for significantly less than the cost of the laptop alone. 
In fact, this $1800 laptop that debuted in December last year for $2300, complete with Ryzen 9 CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 2TB of NVMe storage, a 16-in 2560x1600 (16:10) 240Hz display and Radeon RX 6800M graphics card, goes down to just $1536. And you get a free case, essentially, which you can resell later if you don&#x27;t need it. Or keep it and build a PC in it, because these Corsair cases are actually really lovely!

                              <span>We don&#x27;t normally focus on gaming laptops when it comes to deals, as there&#x27;s little you can upgrade in most machines. One thing that is usually possible is a RAM upgrade, and today we&#x27;ve discovered a good price on a 32GB kit of DDR4-3200 RAM from TeamGroup. Right now this Elite 2x16GB kit is available for £70, more than £30 less than its usual price. If you&#x27;d like your laptop to be equipped with 32GB of RAM for gaming or content creation, and you&#x27;re currently on 16GB or less, this is a nice little upgrade for the money!

                              <span>Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it&#x27;s neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it&#x27;s both of those things. It&#x27;s more a &quot;reimagining&quot; of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. 
I recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I&#x27;m something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.

After voting for your favourite strategy games of all time in our very first RPS Bestest Best: Reader Edition list last month, this time we&#x27;re asking you do it all over again for your favourite survival games. With Sons Of The Forest taking over Steam at the moment and Capcom&#x27;s sensational remake of Resident Evil 4 just on the horizon, we&#x27;ve got survival games on the brain right now - or at least the bit that hasn&#x27;t been chewed or nibbled on by the worrying pack of zombs circling the Treehouse lately, anyway. The less said about that, the better, because some the team are looking mighty peaky right now. Before they turn, though, come and tell us about your favourite survival games so the rest of us have some good tips for how to save our skins.

                              <span>In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.
For eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.

WWE 2K23 doesn’t break the mold from last year’s big re-debut, instead offering smaller improvements and additions to the elements that worked.The action feels similar but a little more polished, the modes have more features, and is a more solid package all around. Though there are still some kinks to work out, 2K23 stands as a respectable follow-up. 
Control-wise, 2K23 is identical to the previous game’s revamped setup, but is a bit smoother. Legacy issues remain, however, such as how finicky picking up weap…</span>

                              <span>Editor&#x27;s Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, &quot;law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.&quot; Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor&#x27;s public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond &quot;The Wire,&quot; Reddick also had roles in other shows like &quot;Fringe,&quot; &quot;Lost,&quot; &quot;Bosch,&quot; and even last year&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series on Netflix. His movie credits include the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise (he was promoting the latest, &quot;John Wick 4,&quot; which hits theaters soon, just this week), &quot;Godzilla Vs. Kong,&quot; and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2&#x27;s Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation&#x27;s Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy&#x27;s Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick:

                              <span>Between The Last of Us, The Mandalorian, and a viral TikTok audio, Pedro Pascal has been on a roll this month. Now, he&#x27;s branching out into something he&#x27;s never done before: mobile game ads. Following in the footsteps of actress Kathy Bates, Pascal has recently appeared in a series of promotional shorts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion, and Game Informer can exclusively reveal the latest installment. Check it out below:


In this series, Pascal plays a detective named Tim Rockford, who&#x27;s trying to figure out what exactly is going on with the mysterious grandma in Merge Mansion. It&#x27;s an enigma so elusive that he never even says exactly what he is he&#x27;s investigating, though from the collection of knives he has in his evidence room, it seems an act of violence was committed.
In a press release, Pascal had the following to say about this role.
What exactly is Tim Rockford investigating? What is grandma putting in her pies? Will Pedro Pascal become a playable character in-game? You&#x27;ll have to play Merge Mansion, available on iOS and Android devices, to find out.
Which extremely high-profile actor do you think will appear in a Merge Mansion ad next? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Strayed Lights is out next month on consoles and PC, but you can play it today via a new Steam demo. 
Developer Embers announced the news of this demo today during the Mix Direct Spring 2023 Showcase that aired today alongside a new trailer for the game. Strayed Lights continues to look great visually, and the action looks awesome. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Strayed Lights gameplay trailer below: 


&quot;In Strayed Lights, you travel through otherworldly regions of misty woods, glowing ruins, and corrupted cities while pursued by eerie shadow creatures,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;You also take on boss fights with colossal creatures wrought with unbridled emotion. Your tiny light will grow, picking up new abilities and increasing in size, before eventually evolving into a pseudo-mystical entity imbued with vivid powers. 
&quot;Meanwhile, you&#x27;ll get a glimpse at the mysteries of the surrounding world, whether through other strayed lights like yourself, or different creatures entirely. The game is set to an atmospheric soundtrack that reflects states of feeling in creatures you encounter, by Grammy-award-winning composer Austin Wintory – whose previous projects include Journey, Abzu, and The Banner Saga Series.&quot; 
As for the new Steam demo, Embers calls it a &quot;limited time&quot; experience so if you&#x27;re interested in checking the game out, do it as soon as you can because there&#x27;s no word on when the demo will no longer be available. 

&quot;We are thrilled to be able to share our new gameplay trailer and demo with fans of Strayed Lights,&quot; Embers co-founder and creative director Alexandre Arramon writes in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;ve been working hard to create a game that is both engaging and visually outstanding, and we can&#x27;t wait for players to experience it for themselves.&quot; 
Strayed Lights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 25.

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Last year, the studio revealed Layers of Fears, a &quot;psychological horror chronicle built upon the foundations of the original Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear: Inheritance, and Layers of Fear 2.&quot; This new game is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 collection of Bloober Team&#x27;s Layers of Fear series, unified with new elements that tie the overall story together. 
Bloober Team revealed last month that Layers of Fears is now called Layers of Fear and will release sometime this June. Now, you can check out the game in action in the new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer below:

                              <span>Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it&#x27;s time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. 
However, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of &quot;the coolest cards&quot; articles I&#x27;ve done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can&#x27;t help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.
In total, the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:

                              <span>Publisher Perfect World and developer Black Wings have revealed Persona 5: The Phantom X, a new mobile spin-off game for iOS and Android devices. It will be free-to-play and feature in-game purchases. 
There&#x27;s no release date for the game yet, but a playtest will begin March 29 in China, as reported by IGN. The visuals and gameplay look quite similar to Persona 5, which isn&#x27;t surprising considering Atlus, the original makers of Persona 5, are supervising The Phantom X&#x27;s development.
You can watch the game&#x27;s reveal trailer below: 


IGN reports that the game focuses on the theme of &quot;desire,&quot; and that much like in Persona 5, Phantom X members will be able to enjoy a day at school, take part in after-school activities, and of course, infiltrate various palaces by way of the Metaverse. 
Check out the Persona 5: The Phantom X gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailers above, Persona 5: The Phantom X is shaping up to be a pretty faithful spin-off to Persona 5. Here&#x27;s hoping we all get to go hands-on with it soon. 

In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 review and then check out our review of Persona 5 Royal. Read our Persona 5 Strikers review after that.

There are two entirely different audiences for the Resident Evil 4 remake: those who have played the original game, perhaps multiple or even dozens of times over the last 18 years, and people who have never played it, but want to know what the fuss is all about. Let&#x27;s start with the former: unequivocally, if you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you must play the remake. It&#x27;s not only one of the best action games in recent m…</span>

                              <span>Sea of Stars, Sabotage Studio’s promising retro-inspired RPG (and our cover story this month), is coming to Xbox consoles. Until now, the game was only slated for PlayStation, Switch, and PC. 
The RPG prequel to The Messenger arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 29 alongside the other versions. The developer made the announcement on its Kickstarter page, writing, 
“Since the very beginning, we were secretly hoping to be able to cover all current and previous generation consoles. With production being a world of curve balls, we had to leave the messaging at &#x27;PC and Consoles&#x27; to avoid having to walk some things back. With the big unknowns now in the rear view, we are delighted to finally confirm the addition of Xbox to the party!”
Additionally, Sabotage revealed that Sea of Stars’ playable demo, currently available only on Switch, will make its way to other platforms later this year.
You can learn more about Sea of Stars by checking out our cover story. Sea of Stars will also be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Last year, Dying Light 2 Stay Human studio, Techland, revealed the first look at its unannounced fantasy RPG that&#x27;s now in development. Now, the studio has released another conceptual look at the game. 
Back when Techland revealed it was working on this game in May of last year, it referred to the unannounced game as a &quot;AAA open-world action-RPG in a fantasy setting.&quot; Today&#x27;s new concept art features some additional details, this time with more of a focus on how the game is a narrative-driven epic. 
&quot;We never stop improving,&quot; Techland&#x27;s tweet reads. &quot;Our newest game is set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic with an exotic open world ready to be explored. We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for.&quot;

                              <span>Fireshine Games, the publisher behind titles like Lies of P and Dredge, has revealed Toads of the Bayou, a new turn-based tactical game coming to Early Access on PC next year. 
Toads of the Bayou is the first game from La Grange, a new studio based in France, and it brings roguelike deckbuilding, settlement-building elements, and more to the strategy genre. In the game, players will control a band of toads looking for a place to call home in the swamps of the deep south. However, in order to protect your settlement, you&#x27;ll need to fend off the evil Baron Samedi. Along the way, you&#x27;ll grow your toad family, create more powerful decks, build a settlement, and more across each run. 
Check out the action for yourself in the Toads of the Bayou teaser trailer below: 


&quot;Toads of the Bayou is about combining southern gothic spookiness and the sweet taste of cartoon memories into our own take on the turn-based tactical genre,&quot; La Grange game designer Alexandre Clement writes in a press release. &quot;The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron&#x27;s evil forces is a real achievement.&quot; 
Toads of the Bayou will hit Early Access via Steam on PC sometime in 2024.

                              <span>Publisher Bethesda Softworks and developer Arkane Studios have released a new story trailer for Redfall, and it features four of the vampiric big bads we&#x27;ll be battling in Massachusetts this May. 
Running nearly three and a half minutes long, this trailer shows off quite a bit of the quaint (and vampire-ridden) town of Redfall. We see our heroes in action, utilizing special abilities like invisibility, as well as a healthy dose of vampires. We also get an introduction to The Hollow Man, Bloody Tom, Miss Whisper, and the Black Sun, four vampires who appear to be at the top of the food (blood) chain in town. 
Check them out for yourself in the Redfall story trailer below: 


As you can see, this new story trailer details quite a lot about what&#x27;s going on in Redfall. There are hints at the corporation behind it all, the types of vampires we&#x27;ll be facing off against, many of the locales we&#x27;ll be shooting our way through, and much more. 
For more about the game, check out the Redfall developer deep dive held back in January, and then watch this trailer from October that invites you to a bloody night on the town. After that, read our Redfall preview for details on how you and your friends will take back the city this summer. 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2, 2023.

Sumo Digital announced via an exclusive reveal with IGN that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 18, 2023. The studio also announced that a technical test would be held on May 25, 2023, before the game&#x27;s launch later this year.
Check out the official Texas Chain Saw Massacre release date trailer for yourself below: 


Eligibility details for the upcoming technical test will be released by Gun Interactive and Sumo Digital on social media, so tune in there if you&#x27;re interested.

                              <span>Atari has revealed that it has acquired 12 classic arcade properties, including Berzerk and its sequel, Frenzy. 
Strangely, though, Atari did not reveal all 12 properties that it has acquired. In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a &quot;dozen retro arcade games&quot; so it&#x27;s likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. 
&quot;Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the &#x27;80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy,&quot; the press release reads. &quot;Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations.&quot;
Atari says Berzerk is &quot;a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980.&quot; It&#x27;s perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. 
&quot;Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,&quot; Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. &quot;Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.&quot;
Who knows if we&#x27;ll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell. In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration.

Dubbed &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; the first chapter of the DCU is set to feature at least 10 movie and TV projects. One of those projects is a new Superman movie called &quot;Superman: Legacy.&quot;
At the time of the movie&#x27;s announcement, it was rumored that Gunn was going to direct it but that wasn&#x27;t confirmed. However, Safran said he personally hoped Gunn would direct it. Yesterday, Gunn confirmed on Twitter that he will, in fact, direct &quot;Superman: Legacy&quot; with a heartfelt post. 
Yes, I’m directing Superman: Legacy to be released on July 11, 2025. My brother Matt told me when he saw the release date he sta…</span>

Ahead of that, though Marcus Stewart and I played a few matches to get a sense of what the game is and why there are dinosaurs coming out of portals. We never really got a great answer to that question, but we had a good time. Check out the video below watch us take on a litany of dinosaurs while Marcus tries to make up his mind about what class he wants to be.

Their first project is publishing Earth Of Oryn, a fellow citybuilder with a medieval setting which is taking inspiration from Banished, Age Of Empires and RimWorld.

Poly Bridge 3 is releasing on May 30th for PC and it’ll continue the series’ tradition of unstable bridge construction, with a hint of Trials Fusion’s topsy-turvy physics. Your goal here is to get your vehicle from one side of the level to the next, hoping to dear god that your recently-built bridge doesn’t collapse.

Not more affordable, just &quot;affordable&quot;, which kind of implies that the old price for the Team Ninja action game was unaffordable. 

As of today, Stranger Of Paradise therefore costs £35/$40 from the Epic Games Store, down from £50/$60. Nobody tell them that a bunch of their other games still cost $70.

                              <span>Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.
What’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are &quot;looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck&#x27;s anniversary.&quot; You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.
All three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.

What are some of the bad launches we remember? What part do we play in this ecosystem? Are we just doomed to get bad PC ports for the next few years, or is this going to happen forever now.
Plus, a terrifying Tower Of Jocularity that challenges us to know when games came out (we do quite well, I think), the games we&#x27;ve been playing right now, and a trio of movie recommendations.

                              <span>Developer IO Interactive recently put their stealthy Hitman series on hiatus after adding a roguelike mode to the combined World Of Assassination package. Since then, the studio have been tight-lipped about their current projects, an “online fantasy RPG” and their mysterious James Bond game - until now. Speaking with Eurogamer, IO co-owners Christian Elverdam and Hakan Abrak shed some light on the Bond project, letting us know that it’s an origin story and that it’ll follow a brand-new 007.

                              <span>I’m not a big fan of fighting for my survival while being chased by a horde of mutant cannibals in games, so I basically wrote off Sons Of The Forest as not really my thing and moved on with my life. Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.
It all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You&#x27;re telling me this is basically a farming sim?

                              <span>Despite lawsuits and other messy goings-on at Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM recently, things are starting to look a little sunnier for this troubled RPG maker. Three of its lawsuits with former employees have been resolved this week, and today marks the arrival of a new mode in the game called Collage Mode, a daft and very entertaining screenshotting and diorama tool that lets you arrange Revachol&#x27;s many, many inhabitants in all sorts of weird scenes, poses and sizes. And yes, that is a giant Kim and Kuno up top there tormenting your tiny detective protagonist. What of it?

                              <span>Modders are having fun with Resident Evil 4&#x27;s Chainsaw demo. Earlier in the week, they replaced Leon’s gun and knife combo with a banana and a spoon - optimal zombie-slaying tools, but now some more, err, drastic mods have been created for the horror action revival. By drastic, I mean modder IvenXIII has replaced the chainsaw-wielding Salvador with Shrek.

After taking us to Korea, Cities: Skylines will continue its world tour with three new Content Creator Packs on March 22nd - next Wednesday - and a Colossal Order-developed mini-expansion in May.

                              <span>The Sims 4 recently spawned infants into its life sim sandbox via a free update, and the substantial Growing Together expansion. At launch, Sims would go from nascent babies to walking, talking kids, skipping the infant years that teach them, for example, how to talk in Simlish, although that does sound like baby talk too. The new expansion adds a lot to Sim’s life stages, but the real show stealer here is a pesky bug that elongates babies. Yes, you read that correctly.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.


If you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.


You can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs.

                              <span>Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. 
Here’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.
So yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I&#x27;m going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.

                              <span>Just last week, Alice0 wrote about Before The Green Moon, an endearing hybrid between slice-of-life adventure and farming sim that’s set at the base of a space elevator. It was cute and intriguing, and best of all it was coming from Turnfollow, the devs behind Little Party and Wide Ocean Big Jacket - two small, but awesome, story-centric indies. A mere week after being announced Before The Green Moon snuck past us and launched into full release. Just yesterday, in fact.

                              <span>I know you all like Hardspace: Shipbreaker, and I get that on paper it is very much my type of game. It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).
The main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.

                              <span>When Tango GameWorks announced Hi-Fi Rush was getting a photo mode, I knew I was in trouble. You know I have a tendency to get emotionally invested in games with photo modes (one might say too invested, in the case of my Death Stranding BB Boys road trip diary), and yep, you couldn&#x27;t have predicted a more likely turn of events if you tried. Because yes, instead of bopping along to its excellent, punchy rhythm action combat and, you know, actually playing the damn thing, I&#x27;ve spent most of my early hours with Hi-Fi Rush fiddling about with image sliders and lining up Chai and best video game cat bot 808 into daft, stupid poses for the sake of a good screenshot. But hot damn, what a great game it is all the same.

                              <span>Irish drama The Banshees Of Inisherin walked home empty-handed on Sunday after being nominated for nine Academy Awards at the Oscars show. But the film shouldn’t be too sad since it’s received the biggest prize of all: a Pac-Man-like video game adaptation as a free game in your web browser. “It was an interesting challenge,” says Cogs &amp; Marvel’s creative director, Jon Hozier-Byrne. “How can you tell a complex story in the simplest narrative form?” The answer is Banshees: The Game, a short, hilarious, 8-bit game that you can play right here.

                              <span>In the latest edition of Ask RPS, our new mailbag feature where RPS supporters pose us questions that we then answer in public posts for everyone to enjoy, we&#x27;re turning our gaze to that loved and loathed staple of the video gaming landscape: achievements. Ah, achievements. Never mind if they&#x27;re good or bad. Today, we&#x27;re remembering the terrible things we&#x27;ve done to actually get them.
The question comes courtesy of Fachewachewa, who asked: What&#x27;s the worst thing you&#x27;ve done for an achievement? Or more generally, a time you were focused on a specific goal in a game, reached it (or gave up), and after, looked back and thought, &quot;Why did I do that?&quot; 
Why, indeed. Come and find out which achievements have spawned our biggest gaming regrets, and why not tell us about your own gaming follies in the comments? We can all wallow in our foolishness together.

The game’s sandy dunes and over-the-top combat gave Ed chirpy AA vibes, whle the rest of us were relegated to the initial CG trailer and the hands-off preview. Until now. Publisher Focus Entertainment have now debuted a gameplay trailer for all of us, too - although it mostly consists of second-long combat snippets, sandwiched in between very grave and serious and important VO.

                              <span>Last year, Need for Speed Unbound brought high-octane races chockful of adrenaline-fueled police chases to create the best racing game of the year, according to our 2022 end-of-year awards. Today, developer Criterion Games and publisher Electronic Arts announced Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2, a title update that delivers new race types, rides, upgrades, events, challenges, cosmetics, and ways to interact with friends.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 aims to give players fresh ways to storm the streets of Lakeshore and compete. This update, which represents the first in a series of post-launch updates, introduces additional Endurance Events, new Rumble Races, and the ability to provoke cops into multiplayer chases with your friends. Volume 2 also adds 40 new challenges, including 3 new daily challenges to earn rewards like experience and money. 
New 30-second Hot Laps circuits are one way to race against the clock to earn new rewards, while Playlist Events offer more variety and major rewards like a Custom Lotus Emira Balmain Edition. Rewards in Volume 2 include new driving effects, poses, stickers, and more. You can see the trailer for the announcement below:


This update also adds the option to purchase the marked locations of all 100 Bears, 80 Street Arts, 80 Billboards, and 160 activities on your map for $5. That premium DLC unlock also includes an exclusive &quot;Fury and Zen&quot; clothing pack, which features a jacket, t-shirt, sweatpants, and cap.
Need for Speed Unbound – Volume 2 arrives on March 21 for all versions of the base game. For more on Need for Speed Unbound, check out our review here.</span>
