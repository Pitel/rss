                              <span>A new study reveals how purchasing a Kodi-powered streaming box changed the Internet and media consumption habits of US households. The researchers use these boxes as a piracy proxy, as they were often loaded with third-party piracy apps. Interestingly, their data show that the use of these boxes led to increased legal consumption through on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube.

Halloween is indisputably the best holiday of the year, so naturally, the spookily-themed events in live service games are something I look forward to every October. Overwatch has always had the best one in my opinion, with Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge (and its annual iterations) being a welcome, stylish PvE switch up to the usual competitive multiplayer formula. I remember when the original Halloween event dropped in Overwatch, and from what I can recall it was the first event of its kind in the game. Everyone lose their collective minds over all the cool skins and other cosmetics, the retheming of the menu and usual maps, and the fun bits of story that tied it all together.

As one moves into adulthood, it&#x27;s possible to look back and laugh at things that once terrified you. Sure, the adult world contains more than its fair share of horrors worth recoiling from, but at least we gamers can look back at the digital scares of our youth with a satisfied smile, knowing we&#x27;ve conquered our childish fears. Right?
Well, mostly. We&#x27;re sure the Sonic drowning countdown music will forever spark instant, sweaty panic whenever we hear it.

As you might recall, Bayonetta 3 has a &quot;Naive Angel Mode&quot; - allowing players to toggle between more or less revealing character outfits. If you are playing a certain way, and are curious to see what the other version looks like, you&#x27;re in luck.
GameXplain has put together a video showing off several moments from the third entry to see just how much the &quot;Naive Angel Mode&quot; actually censors the lead Umbra Witch.

                              <span>I see that box art... Silent Hill.
Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
For last week&#x27;s brawl, we took a look at the fantastic arcade first-person shooter Timesplitters 2 for the GameCube.

Nintendo became an important part of the Bayonetta series&#x27; future - helping fund the second game on Wii U, and going on to bankroll the third game.
Platinum&#x27;s Hideki Kamiya has previously mentioned how thankful he is to Nintendo for stepping in to help &quot;kick off this project&quot; and now he&#x27;s commented on this once again now that Bayonetta 3 has finally been released.

                              <span>Boo! Ha ha, don&#x27;t worry, reader dear! That was just me, not any sort of goblin, boglin, or nilbog—this time...! I do always enjoy Halloweentime, and not just because I own a litre of movie-grade fake blood. It&#x27;s nice to enjoy this sort of stuff as the days draw shorter, and after this we get to launch into Christmastime and 24/7 Hallmark Channel movies (pro tip: look for ones with Andrew W Walker or Cameron Mathison, they&#x27;re usually good). But first, what are you playing this weekend? We do have some offbeat Halloween lists if you need inspiration. And here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>Geralt of Rivia is dead. Long live Geralt of Rivia
If you&#x27;ve been on social media at all in the past few days or managed to make it through the entirety of Black Adam, you&#x27;ve probably heard that Henry Cavill is once again suiting up as the Man of Steel. Whether or not his return to the DC Extended Universe will finally help Warner Bros. get that disaster train back on track remains to be seen. What we do know is that Cavill will be walking away from the role that&#x27;s kept him busy in the years since he had to have his mustache digitally removed in post-production. It was announced today that Cavill is stepping down as Geralt of Rivia in the hit Netflix adaptation of The Witcher.
https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1586433840318648321
As you can see in the tweet above, Cavill will be replaced in season 4 by Robert California Liam Hemsworth. The second-tier Hemsworth is probably best known for his role as Gale Hawthrone in the Hunger Games films and, like many of his fellow Aussies, a brief stint on the soap opera Neighbours. He also did a show for Quibi. Raise your hand if you remember Quibi.
While Cavill is leaving the Netflix series behind, fans will still be able to see him as Geralt when The Witcher&#x27;s third season debuts sometime next year. If you&#x27;re like me and just subscribed to Netflix for the first time in six years a few days ago, know there is a lot of Witcher content to consume on the streamer, including the animated film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf and The Witcher: Blood Origin, a prequel series that&#x27;ll debut in December (fingers crossed it&#x27;s better than that dreary House of the Dragon). In addition to all that, a second animated film has also been commissioned and there is apparently a family-friendly spin-off in the works.

It&#x27;s a pretty good time to be a fan of farm sims right now. We&#x27;re just days away from the launches of Square-Enix&#x27;s Harvestella and Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom, while Disney Dreamlight Valley is proving popular enough for people looking to get their farming fix with a heaping dose of Disney magic. Plenty of stuff to enjoy right now, but it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s launching next year that has me more excited than anything else. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake heads our way in a matter of months. Initially revealed for the Nintendo Switch, Xseed Games confirmed this week the A Wonderful Life remake will launch on all modern platforms simultaneously in North America.
Set in the tranquil Forgotten Valley, A Wonderful Life tasks players with building up a farm and seeing it through to the end of their character&#x27;s life. Life with other games in the series, players can get married and start a family, but your decisions will determine if your kid carries on the family tradition of running the farm or setting off to discover their own path in life. As has already been confirmed, all marriage candidates can be romanced no matter your farmer&#x27;s chosen gender, and players can make their farmer non-binary.

The Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake will release on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S next summer. As a reminder, Xseed Games is also releasing a remastered edition of Rune Factory 3, titled Rune Factory 3 Special, in 2023. That game is currently only on tap for the Switch.

                              <span>The company is working on a &quot;large-scale, global title&quot;
Sega is continuing to work on its &quot;Super Game&quot; project, and it now has a rough deadline. The company wants to launch its super game by March 2026, at the latest.
The super game is something the company has talked about before, as part of its long-term strategy. And in a recent financial filing, Sega is ballparking it for a launch sometime before March 2026.
As for what a super game is, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi describes it as a large-scale, global title. The ultimate goal for this project is to generate more active users than any other games they&#x27;ve made thus far.
&quot;One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos,&quot; said Satomi in the filing. &quot;That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement—which can then draw in even more users and grow the game’s presence dramatically.&quot;
There have been some rumors about what the super game project might entail, but we&#x27;ve still yet to get a firm idea.

A new frontier
We do know that this super game isn&#x27;t Sonic Frontiers, which is set to launch in November. Sega also has a few other games in store between now and 2026, like the recently revealed Like a Dragon: Ishin.
There&#x27;s more in the works for Sega&#x27;s older IP, too. In the filing today, the company specifically cites &quot;dormant&quot; IP. The company will continue to develop these by &quot;means of remakes, remastering, and reboots,&quot; so it sounds like more old Sega hits could see the limelight.

I&#x27;m not much of a pumpkin-carver myself, but one of the my favorite Halloween activities is seeing everyone post their cool jack-o&#x27;-lanterns online. It&#x27;s all of the fun of a time-honored tradition with none of the work or mess, so that&#x27;s a win-win in my book. While there are some pretty impressive carvings out there, obviously the best ones are the gaming-themed gourds, and there are plenty of them out there. This year, I scoured Reddit in search of the best pumpkins so you don&#x27;t have to, and I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the selection this year.
Cult of the Lamb
Starting off strong with one of my favorite games of the year, this pumpkin features the titular character of Cult of the Lamb, the adorably twisted roguelike/mana…</span>

                              <span>Dragonflight is out on November 28
The time has come for the World of Warcraft pre-Dragonflight expansion patch, much to the delight of lapsed players everywhere. Let&#x27;s talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.
Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the pre-Dragonflight expansion patch:
The talent system has been revamped, and here&#x27;s the biggest change: &quot;Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.&quot;
You can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races
Full UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods
Season 4 ends this week, with a &quot;post-season&quot; lull until the expansion arrives
After all this, the &quot;second phase&quot; of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new God of War), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.
Shadowlands, the current WoW expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with WoW, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (especially when all this came out)...and of course, it was also at a time when Final Fantasy XIV was really, really good. Maybe Dragonflight can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
If you want to dig further, you can find the full patch notes here.

                              <span>Doctor Shmup
If you fancy something a lil&#x27; cute &#x27;n&#x27; weird for your retro fix this week, then you&#x27;re in luck, as Hamster has reached into the Namco back catalog and pulled out one of the developer&#x27;s few horizontally scrolling shmups, the totes adorbs Ordyne, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to Japanese arcades in 1988 and capitalizing on the high-color, high-goofball attraction of Konami&#x27;s Parodius, Ordyne sees a highly intelligent professor, Dr. Tomari, take to the skies in order to rescue his kidnapped sweetheart Kana, who has been abducted by his rival, Dr. Kubata. Accompanying the good Doctor on his quest is loyal sidekick Sunday Chin. SUNDAY CHIN. What follows is action exceptionally similar to Gradius/Parodius, with familiar enemy patterns, pacing, and power-ups. Still, the Konami titles are sound examples of the genre, and thus, so is Ordyne.
Check out the colorful action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Were1974.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4rHIWgljPGQ
As they battle through each stage, Tomari and Chin can gather crystals mid-flight, to be spent at a series of anti-gravity stores, run by a typical doe-eyed anime gal. Much like Sega&#x27;s Fantasy Zone, our heroes can then purchase speed boosts, extra lives, shields, and many other items in order to give the duo the edge in battle. Oddly, the weapons are time-limited, meaning that you&#x27;ll only maintain that edge for so long before returning to your default form. What kinda shop offers that service?
Ordyne would eventually receive a port on the PC Engine — a form that would eventually see the game head west for the first time ever. It hasn&#x27;t featured on all that many Namco compilations over the years, so remains something of an oddity even today. If you&#x27;d like to get your wings on in on a bright-eyed rescue mission, then Ordyne is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at around $8.

So said Charles Cyphers&#x27; Sherriff Brackett in John Carpenter&#x27;s seminal classic, Halloween... He also said it in David Gordon Green&#x27;s not-so-seminal Halloween Kills, despite it being 40 years later, and nobody in the scene having been on-site for the first time he said it. Still, that&#x27;s the DGG Halloween trilogy to a tee: Remember that? Here it is again! (also, mobs are bad). I saw Halloween Ends. I don&#x27;t hate it like most hate it, but it does feel like a film made while the crew was giggling and saying &quot;The fans will be SO mad!&quot;

Aside from costumes, big bowls of sweets and the impending fear that I&#x27;m A Celebrity will soon dominate TV again, if there is one thing that you can bank on over Halloween, it&#x27;s lots, and lots of scary video games. The spooky season has an annoying habit of seeking out those of us — this writer included — who are not the best with things that go bump in the night, plastering our news feeds with lists of &#x27;Top Ten Games To Ruin Your Sleep Schedule&#x27; or &#x27;Video Game Moments That Will Make You Think Twice Before Turning The Light Off&#x27;. Yes, we&#x27;ve read them, and yes, they keep us up at night every time.
For some people, horror just does not click — books, films or, importantly, games. But many of us do, however, still like to get involved in the festivities, albeit in a much more cozy, less give-you-sleepless-nights-for-a-week kind of way.

Survival horror games are tough to get right. Even giants of the genre like Resident Evil find themselves leaning harder into action or simple jump scares over time, but when it is at its best it is more tense than frightening. Signalis is one of the best survival horror games we’ve played and the perfect title for Switch owners to dive into.
We mentioned Resident Evil because it is easy to see the influence that series has had on Signalis. Players control Elster, a Replika android that awakens in a crashed spaceship with fragmented memories and a mission to find her lost friend. All she knows is that she is somewhere in an abandoned mining facility that has been overrun with corrupted androids.

After two weeks of back-and-forth drama, we are pleased that Bayonetta 3 is finally out to rave reviews. We are never going to have to talk about another VA dispute ever again, right? Yes, the gun-slinging, crowd-winning Umbra Witch is back and (not to spoil the following feature) we are excited to play.
While we awaited the game&#x27;s release with bated breath, it has been a big week of anniversaries here at Nintendo Life. We weighed in on what we would like the Super Mario Odyssey sequel to look like as the game turned five; one year on, we broke down whether the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack has made itself worthwhile; and we celebrated the fifth anniversary The Mummy Demastered by discussing how it worked where the film failed.

One game you&#x27;ll want to be on the lookout for early on in 2023 is Fire Emblem Engage. In fact, it&#x27;s out in the first month of the year, launching exclusively on Switch on 20th January.
This upcoming adventure brings both new and old characters together, and in the lead-up to the game&#x27;s release, Nintendo has slowly been showing off the many heroes you&#x27;ll get to know and use in battle. The latest reveal is a character with colourful hair named Chloe.

Bayonetta 3 is finally here and as usual with the latest Nintendo release, Digital Foundry has taken a closer look at the game&#x27;s performance and frame rate. So how does it hold up?
In short, John Linneman thinks the third game has &quot;some serious technical hiccups&quot;, and that it&#x27;s a game that &quot;feels as if the entire production was in search of more powerful hardware that never ultimately arrived&quot;.

I’ve said it before, but I’m a massive fan of Ghostbusters. However, I don’t think you get the whole picture. Back in my teen years, I was an active part of the Ghostbusters fan community on the internet. This was back in ‘01 to maybe ‘04. I made my own costume, discussed the movies and the gear within, and speculated on a possible Ghostbusters 3. I don’t really have any stories of anything bad happening, but I still have a bad taste in my mouth. It’s like, “Ew. I existed when I was a teenager. How horrid!”
It was a different time on the internet, that’s for certain. The dotcom bubble burst, Web 2.0 was starting to swing, and we were about to see the short boom of Livejournal and MySpace before Facebook and Twitter would arrive to homogenize the internet c…</span>

                              <span>This NSFW cat-themed roguelike is &quot;hopefully&quot; coming in 2024
The Binding of Isaac is renowned as one of the most influential indie games of all time, and I personally believe it helped usher in the wave of awesome roguelikes that have come out in its wake. The game was created by a teeny tiny team, but the whole project was the brainchild of Edmund McMillen, who also created Super Meat Boy, another indie classic. His new game, Mewgenics, has been in the works for over a decade now, but for the first time in years, we finally have an update on the title -- or more specifically, an actual release window.
Mewgenics is a &quot;turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats,&quot; according to the game&#x27;s Steam page, and will allow players to &quot;hoard, breed, train, and set cats out on epic adventures through a sprawling world of complete chaos.&quot; The release window is currently listed as &quot;sometime in 2024 (hopefully),&quot; and while that&#x27;s a while to wait, it&#x27;s just nice to know that the game is still coming out at all. It also looks like it&#x27;s going to have the same dark, twisted sense of humor that McMillen is known for. I mean, just look at this gif he posted as the announcement of the Steam page going live:
https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1586047233715101696
Other features of the game listed on the Steam page include &quot;100s of hours of gameplay,&quot; &quot;6+ classes, each with 50+ unique abilities to draft from,&quot; &quot;200+ enemies and bosses that will upset your mom,&quot; and many more. We already know that McMillen has an eye for some of the most engaging gameplay out there, and Mewgenics looks like it&#x27;s shaping up to be his most complex project yet. I know I&#x27;m pumped to give it a try when it drops eventually, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the creator&#x27;s design sensibilities have evolved over time.

                              <span>Some insight on NieR&#x27;s legacy from some of its creative leads
NieR: Automata was recently ported to the Nintendo Switch, and by most accounts, it was an excellent transfer over.
Alongside checking the game out, we got the chance to send over a handful of questions to the leads behind NieR: Automata. Posed with the chance to ask director Yoko Taro, producer Yosuke Saito, and composer Keiichi Okabe about the 2017 game and its legacy, we inquired about a few things.
Could 2B ever cross over into more games? Why was bringing Automata to the Switch important? Does Yoko Taro love money? All of this and more lies below. (And yes, we did ask about the church, but did not receive a response.)

                              <span>Yeah, this was worth bringing back again
It&#x27;s hard to really stress how incredible Tactics Ogre&#x27;s legacy is. Originally debuting in 1995 in Japan, it gained a lot of traction in 1997 on PlayStation with a North American release. While I can distinctly point to January of 1998, and Final Fantasy Tactics, as the time where I went &quot;yeah, I&#x27;m pretty into SRPGs,&quot; Tactics Ogre really was the genesis of it, beyond what I had dabbled in before it. It was the talk of my friend groups, and got so many people into the genre. So when, out of nowhere, I learned that it was coming back in 2022 (beyond the PSP edition) as Tactics Ogre: Reborn, I was ecstatic.
Yes, let&#x27;s rediscover one of the most interesting SRPGs ever made, through a modern lens, with a completely new audience in play. This &quot;final trail…</span>

                              <span>We also get a good look at the new mode
Hitman 3: Freelancer is a new mode for the assassination game, set to arrive on January 26, 2023. But ahead of that, IO Interactive is hosting a closed technical test in November.
The Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will take place on November 3 through 7. The closed technical test will only be available on PC via Steam, and it will be a separate game, with a download code delivered by IO if you&#x27;re chosen.
Sign-ups for the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test are live here.
We also got a pretty decently sized gameplay video today, showcasing just how Hitman 3: Freelancer works. The walkthrough shows off many different aspects of the roguish new mode: picking contracts, planning, touring the home base, and then setting out for a mission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;N2ZZlIMdavM
Even Agent 47 is part of the gig economy
The mode will pose a bunch of new challenges and options to players, based around the maps of the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy.
For the closed technical test, only a select portion of the pool will be available. The nine available maps are: Paris, Sapienza, Hokkaido, Miami, Mumbai, Whittleton Creek, Dartmoor, Berlin, and Mendoza.
The full Freelancer mode will have just about every map, barring three. The ICA Facility, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, and the Carpathian Mountains will be the only locales not in the full Freelancer launch.

While there is progression within the closed technical test, that mastery will not carry over to the full launch.
But this new way of playing Hitman has looked like a cool alternative for awhile now. I&#x27;m sure some players are probably eager to tinker with the possibilities in it. They&#x27;ll be getting their chance in November, ahead of the full launch at the start of the new year.

                              <span>What do you mean &#x27;Who&#x27;s Captain Tomaday?&#x27;
The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered &#x27;80s/&#x27;90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, Visco Collection offers a look back at some old-school arcade/Neo Geo releases.
The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal! Goal! Goal! (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup Captain Tomaday (1999).

No further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as Capcom Arcade Stadium. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is Neo Drift Out. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.
Visco Collection is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Who Goes There?
Publisher Raw Fury (of Sable fame) has released an intriguing but incredibly eerie trailer for upcoming psychological horror title My Work is Not Yet Done. The lo-fi survival adventure is currently in development for PC at indie outfit Sutemi Productions. A release date was not revealed.
In My Work is Not Yet Done, players will take control of Avery, the last surviving member of an investigative who trekked deep into strange and uncharted country to source a mysterious radio transmission. A brain-heavy piece, the new title will combine investigative and analytical mystery alongside the simulation of surviving as a single person in a changing, isolated, and deeply unnerving environment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sC0fSDi5b4g
As Avery, players will be tasked with continuing the work of her departed investigative team, staying one step ahead of death and insanity while uncovering the clues that will lead to an almost indecipherable phenomenon. From the official blurb, My Work is Not Yet Done appears doom-laden, suggesting that the team&#x27;s — Avery&#x27;s — task may be unfinishable, as each and every day brings with it further mystery, more questions than answers, and the smothering cloud of both isolation and mortal fear. Heavy stuff.
Regardless, with its creepy, staccato imagery, immersive atmosphere, and non-linear approach to adventure, Sutemi&#x27;s new release might prove to be a real sleeper hit for those who like their horror a little on the cerebral side. Definitely worth battering down the brain hatches for, at any rate.

                              <span>The short answer is yes you can dive in; but if you have time, playing the first two would be ideal
If you asked a member of the Platinum marketing team, they&#x27;d probably tell you that Bayonetta 3 as a standalone story that you can dive into. But if you asked Platinum dev and executive Hideki Kamiya, he&#x27;d urge you to play the initial two games first. The latter is mostly true: if you can play the first two, you&#x27;ll get a lot out of it. If you play Bayonetta 3 first you&#x27;ll mostly be fine, but there are bits and pieces from the original two games that will greatly benefit your enjoyment of the story, and certain character interactions.
Minor vague spoilers below in terms of themes, but nothing specific

                              <span>&quot;We apologize that we could not meet demand&quot;
Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages for the newly minted physical editions are sadly plaguing the UK and some regions in Europe, thanks to an exclusive rollout on the My Nintendo Store.
Here&#x27;s the full statement from Nintendo, on Twitter, issued today:
&quot;We apologize that we could not meet demand for the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game recently. We will restock the physical edition of the first Bayonetta game once more later this year, on [the] My Nintendo Store.&quot;

The tweet then goes on to provide a link for update registration here.
Meanwhile, in the US, Bayonetta 1 has been available at several retailers, and is readily in stock at the time of writing at Best Buy. It actually went up for sale weeks ago (I got my copy a while back), and is holding stock. So the &quot;limited quantities&quot; Nintendo spoke of in the past seem to be region-based.
Outside of the regional Bayonetta 1 Switch shortages, this isn&#x27;t the first hectic rodeo from a My Nintendo Store rollout. Xenoblade 3 was rife with access problems, with virtual queues that didn&#x27;t work, or crashed randomly. Ideally Nintendo will stop doing exclusives like this in any region, as the demand clearly exceeds whatever Nintendo has in mind in terms of a sustainable approach to taking pre-orders.
In the meantime, if you really want it and don&#x27;t want to wait on a mystery restock window (or potentially deal with a broken website again), importing from the US could be an option. Secondhand markets aren&#x27;t selling it at obscene prices just yet, and some stores might ship overseas.

It&#x27;s been a long, long, long time coming, but fight fans finally have a release date for QuByte Interactive&#x27;s long-awaited two-hander Breakers Collection — The compendium of old-school-cool fighting titles will finally launch January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.
Breakers Collection consists of two cult fighting titles from the halcyon days of the genre&#x27;s first glory period. Initially developed by Visco Corporation, both Breakers (1996) and its revamped edition, Breakers&#x27; Revenge (1998) have been spruced up with a fab collection of modern-day features. These include rollback netcode, crossplay functionality, a Team Battle mode, a deep training mode, player profiles, new character color options, and a fantastic Interactive Replay mode, which gives players the opportunity to relive their losses and experiment to find out what alternate paths could have been taken.

Initially announced way back in 2019, it would seem that a simple rerelease of two &#x27;90s fighters should not have taken this long to reach fruition. However, it is clear that developer QuByte has gone all out to deliver an excellent package for these cult classics, ensuring that the ever-faithful Breakers community (and yes, it does exist) will receive the perfect product to allow them to take these funky fighters into the next generation and beyond.
My girl Rila has has been benched for far too long, and those nails of hers are ready for action.
Breakers Collection launches January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Physical editions are available to pre-order now exclusively at Strictly Limited Games. Finally, an open beta will take place on Steam the weekend of November 4, so be sure to mark your calendars.

Another Splatoon 3 bug has crept up on the team, as version 1.2.0 (which just came out) caused an issue with Rainmaker mode: found in the Anarchy Battle (ranked) playlist.
Here&#x27;s the full tweet from Nintendo:
&quot;A bug has been found in the Ver.1.2.0 update of #Splatoon3 that affects the Rainmaker Anarchy Battle mode. We will release an update soon to fix this issue. In the meantime, Rainmaker has been temporarily removed from Anarchy Battle. We apologize for the inconvenience.&quot;

So in short, as described by reliable dataminer OatmealDome, the actual bug involves a score counter reset if you touch a checkpoint. That&#x27;s...instant-shutdown worthy for a competitive mode. Funnily enough I&#x27;ve seen some chatter in my circles that some folks seem to like it: as they didn&#x27;t enjoy Rainmaker anyway, and are enjoying it being out of the rotation.
While I&#x27;m still really enjoying Splatoon 3, it&#x27;s been hit by multiplayer bugs since launch, including connection issues. That last patch had roughly 100 fixes, so it was bound to mess up something else. It&#x27;s the Bethesda open world RPG patch effect! That&#x27;s pretty much how every major Fallout 76 patch played out in the early days, with a minor patch afterward to smooth things out.
[Update: As of October 28, Nintendo has implemented patch 1.2.1, which fixes the Rainmaker problems stated above. The mode is now back in the rotation.]

As inevitable as death, taxes, or Hamster&#x27;s Arcade Archives release, Activision&#x27;s newest entry to the Call of Duty franchise, Modern Warfare 2, is enjoying an incredible launch  In fact, the Steam edition of the billion-dollar head-popper has already broken the series record for concurrent players on its first day.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, available today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms is currently entertaining an amazing 192,524 players as of this writing. While this number, in itself, is already the highest number of concurrent CoD Steam players to date, this isn&#x27;t even the peak, as MW2 already hit a pretty nutso high of 238,522 players during its first hour of launch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OeVapCrI1pY
That&#x27;s a stunning 100,000+ players more than the previous record, which has been held by the original Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer since 2010. Once North America wakes up and has its first cup of Joe, it will be interesting to see if this peak number can be smashed even further. Of course, this Steam count represents only one faction of the CoD playerbase, with many choosing to play on PlayStation, Xbox, or Activision Blizzard&#x27;s own Battle.net app.
The success of the newest Call of Duty title has been something of an annual inevitability, with even &quot;lesser&quot; entries such as last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Vanguard still pulling in sales numbers and player figures that most games can only dream of. And it seems, some 18 years from the series&#x27; initial inception — and despite perpetual complaints that the series has &quot;peaked&quot; — Call of Duty will remain one of video gaming&#x27;s most lucrative and fiscally reliable franchises.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.

                              <span>It&#x27;s live now, following the Gilgamesh DLC
Stranger of Paradise transmog is now a thing, thanks to a new update for the game, which also ushers in the second DLC: Gilgamesh.
Titled The Wanderer of The Rift, the DLC launched on October 26, and beyond the actual content it comes with, we got a new title update. One of the big features includes transmog, or as the official Twitter account calls it, &quot;cosmetic changes.&quot;
In short, like many modern games (especially MMOs, but also titles like Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Odyssey or Monster Hunter Rise), you can customize your look to your liking, without missing out on stat bonuses from individual pieces of armor. The DLC itself adds Gilgamesh, the blue mage job, rift labyrinths (randomly generated dungeons), the dimension bringer ability, Gilgamesh difficulty, summon blessings (which are acquired through the Tonberry blacksmith), monster bells (call monsters into battle), and chaotic monsters (super-powerful versions of enemies). So, a lot!
I already dug the game at launch, but Team Ninja and Square Enix have added quite a bit of support over the past few months: addressing fan complaints while adding new content in the form of DLC. Overall, a &quot;Complete Edition&quot; should age very well for hardcore action fans, especially given the &quot;challenge&quot; aspect of the DLCs.
If you want to read more about how the team incorporated feedback into their post-launch design perspective, we have a full interview with key members of the team here.

Free-to-play mobile card game Marvel Snap has already gotten off to a smashing start, having raked in a staggering $2 million USD in revenue since its launch just one week ago. Available on PC and mobile platforms, the card combat title has already been downloaded by some 5.3 million players.
Marvel Snap is a strategic card battler that focuses on the heroes and villains of the legendary comic-book universe. Players engage in battles, single-player challenges, and objective-based modes with their chosen hand of heroes, set against the backdrop of famous locales from the Marvel universe. Part of the title&#x27;s attraction is in slick visual style and library of quality Marvel artwork, as well as its speedy gameplay — The average battle takes around three-to-four minutes.

The data, which was compiled by AppMagic and reported by mobilegamer.biz, shows that the United States has, unsurprisingly, been the most popular territory for downloads, counting for some 1.3 million players and $1.2 million in revenue. Marvel Snap&#x27;s second territory of popularity is Brazil, with 433,000 players, and then Italy, with 342,000. The iOS version of the title has the lion&#x27;s share of the player base.
This is rad and all, but shout me when Jessica Drew shows up.
Marvel Snap is available now on PC, iOS, and Android platforms. You can check out CJ Andriessen&#x27;s thoughts on the title right here.

                              <span>The first Modern Warfare II DLC honors those in the military
The newest mainline Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare II, is out tomorrow, and fans are beyond excited to get into the game. There&#x27;s a lot to try out with the new multiplayer maps and the single-player campaign, plus the revamped battle royale mode that&#x27;s coming out in November, and as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Activision already announced the game&#x27;s first DLC. It&#x27;s called the Endowment Protector pack, and it&#x27;s already available for purchase at the in-game store.
All of the proceeds from the Modern Warfare II DLC will go to Activision Blizzard&#x27;s Call of Duty Endowment, the company&#x27;s very own charity that assists military veterans in the US and UK in finding new jobs after they return from service. The pack will run players $10, with proceeds from the sales going directly to the Call of Duty Endowment up to $4 million. The most notable items in the pack include a skin called &quot;The Protector&quot; for Operator Hutch, along with blueprints for the Protector&#x27;s Companion rifle and the Duty Calls sniper rifle. The rest of the items are as follows:
&quot;Frontline Stripes&quot; Vehicle Skin
&quot;Tagged&quot; Weapon Charm
&quot;Ready for Anything&quot; Animated Calling Card
&quot;Mermen&quot; Calling Card
&quot;Seeing Double&quot; Static Animated Emblem
One Double XP Token, One Double Weapon XP Token

As another special perk for those who serve, Activision has also partnered with USAA to give the Protector Pack away completely free to current and former members of the military in the US. The Call of Duty series relies entirely on the stories and real-life actions of military members (like pulling from real-life battles, for example), so it seems only fitting that they would give some of their massive profits back to those who inspired the games in the first place. I would love to see Activision do even more to support vets in the future, but for now, this is a good enough place to start.

Na rozdíl od jiných jazyků se závislostními typy (např. Agda, Coq a Lean) je Idris určen v první řadě pro psaní aplikací, nikoliv formalizaci matematických důkazů. Je čistě funkcionální a syntakticky vychází z Haskellu.</span>

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.

While those are large, long-coveted features, a new trailer focuses on a couple of smaller additions: two new multiplayer maps, and a new mode, Covert One Flag. And one of the maps looks particularly lovely.

Today, Frontier called the situation &quot;crossed wires&quot;, and said that there are &quot;multiple updates currently in the pipeline, focused on addressing the most important topics raised by the community.&quot;

I&#x27;ve had an eye on All Quiet Roads for months, but between Tile Cities and Blink Planets it seemed a bit much to throw this recommendation at you as well. But a game exclusively about the thing I hate most holding my interest this well has to be respected. All Quiet Roads also balances relaxing, freeform play with stressful, occasionally overwhelming challenges, giving it a tonal variety that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting from such a simple concept.

                              <span>Stress Level Zero&#x27;s Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you&#x27;d need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn&#x27;t quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It&#x27;s also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I&#x27;d seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: &quot;I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.&quot;
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. &quot;Oh shite. Here we go.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a very big enjoyer of horror games. On the very rare occasion that I do boot up a horror game, a chemical change seems to occur in my body. The part of my brain responsible for going &quot;holy mother of hell get me away from this scary thing&quot; is dampened. I expect to be scared, and therefore I&#x27;m more resilient to said scariness. I might just not be very good at getting into the horror games mindset. My brain is too busy battening down all the hatches and readying the engines of war against the oncoming spookies and ghosties.
The times I&#x27;ve been most scared playing a game are when I don&#x27;t expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

                              <span>Square Enix have given us another look at Forspoken, the open world action RPG slated for release on January 24th 2023. The latest deep dive trailer details the game’s magical parkour abilities that you’ll be using to get across the fantasy realm of Athia. Forspoken’s flashy, stamina-based movement is by far the most distinctive thing about it in my eyes, so let&#x27;s take a look at Frey&#x27;s parkour abilities below.

                              <span>Early last week, I had the opportunity to get hands-on with the demo for The Devil In Me, the upcoming fourth entry and season one finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology. I&#x27;m a big Dark Pictures fan, but had some reservations about this latest outing due to its subject matter, which this time around draws more inspiration from real-life serial killers than supernatural legends. Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

All of Mei’s abilities revolve around ice, whether slowing down enemies with a snowy spray or incubating in a cocoon of ice. However, a compilation on Reddit showcases various problems with her Ice Wall ability, which seems to be in need of some serious TLC.

Reports are coming in that the 16-pin power adapter for Nvidia&#x27;s flagship RTX 40 series GPU is getting so hot it&#x27;s actually melting the hardware, which is... err... not something you want happening inside your PC case.

The Resident Evil series has seen its ups and downs over the years. After a strong start with the original trilogy (and Code Veronica), Capcom’s seminal horror franchise hit what many would argue to be its peak with the incredible Resident Evil 4, first launched on GameCube back in 2004. After some questionable decisions over the following years that eventually led to a remarkable revival with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Capcom decided to lean on the success of Resident Evil 4 for its latest mainline entry: Resident Evil: Village.

                              <span>And he&#x27;s not slowing down.
It&#x27;s been a pretty big year for Sonic the Hedgehog. From the commercial success of his second movie back in April to the impending release of the much-anticipated Sonic Frontiers in November and the new Sonic Prime Netflix series in December, it is getting pretty difficult to miss SEGA&#x27;s speedy lil spike ball.
According to the company&#x27;s latest annual report, it is clear that Sonic&#x27;s popularity isn&#x27;t slowing down. The figures contained within the report detail the lifetime sales for all of the company&#x27;s assets (original and acquired) including the likes of Puyo Puyo, Football Manager and Persona. It is Sonic, however, that stands blue head and shoulders above the rest, with the franchise having sold a total of 1.51 billion units (game sales and downloads across paid and free-to-play titles) since its conception back in 1991.

After a year of waiting and months of delays, Bayonetta did get a physical release on Switch earlier this week. Not that many people will have been able to get their hands on a copy of course, as the out-of-the-blue drop sold out almost instantly.
Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that it plans to perform a physical restock of the game &quot;later this year,&quot; with fans now able to register their interest in the title rather than the slap-dash approach that we saw on the company&#x27;s first attempt.

Note: This Cloud Version of A Plague Tale: Requiem was tested on 450Mb AT&amp;T Broadband over WIFI, with the router directly adjacent to the Switch dock.

On paper, it sounds like offering a ‘cloud version’ of a game is a good idea. The Switch’s hardware was relatively underpowered when it was new, so getting more graphically intensive releases like A Plague Tale: Requiem to run on it in an acceptable state only becomes more difficult with each passing year. Cloud streaming could get around this, but it only makes sense if the cloud tech and the machines actually running the game server-side are up to the task. Unfortunately, this otherwise excellent game is marred on Switch by technical issues, making it a tough one to recommend.

                              <span>I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts. The app is named for the Snap mechanic, w…</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a &quot;soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover.&quot; Using these tiles, you can create a &quot;unique story-multiverse&quot; at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

                              <span>Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you&#x27;re looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese version has been canceled due to the game&#x27;s violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan&#x27;s equivalent to the United States&#x27; ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here&#x27;s what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


&quot;The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you.&quot;

As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

This news comes from a Studio Spotlight blog post by Sony Interactive Entertainment in which the company interviews two London Studio heads: co-studio leaders Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders. The pair discuss their careers and jobs at London Studio, as well as what the team is working on. When asked about the studio&#x27;s next game, Saunders shares some new details about what to expect and the teaser image that you can see below. 
&quot;Our next project is an online co-op combat game, which as you can see here, is set in a modern fantasy London,&quot; Saunders says. &quot;The key thing about this is that it&#x27;s a PlayStation 5 title – it&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>Somerville, the mysterious sci-fi adventure game, finally has a release date and it’s only a few weeks away. The game arrives on November 15. 
The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December&#x27;s Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.</span>

                              <span>Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive Mini II, there&#x27;s a message that reads, &quot;In memory of Rieko Kodama.&quot; Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe&#x27;s tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, &quot;As you understand it. We respected her,&quot; confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama&#x27;s death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family&#x27;s privacy, Sega says. 
&quot;We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,&quot; Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama&#x27;s journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series&#x27; visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega&#x27;s Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama&#x27;s family.</span>

                              <span>A new interface is coming to the PC-TV setup
Valve is planning to update its Big Picture viewing mode with the new interface it designed for the Steam Deck. The Steam manufacturer has the new user interface on the beta right now.
This update was announced a while ago, but it looks like it could be rolling out soon. Already, the feature is available in the Steam client through its beta options.
As detailed in a news post, you just need to opt into the Steam Client beta. Then, head over to the properties and add the &quot;-gamepadui&quot; launch parameter. There&#x27;s also a forum open for feedback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AvokyBOYe8Y
Big Picture is Valve&#x27;s special set-up for users who want a Steam UI that&#x27;s more conducive to a TV set-up. And since that often entails a gamepad in hand, the Steam Deck UI does seem like a good fit.
The updated Big Picture mode now includes a new Home Screen, a Universal Search, and optimized Steam Store for controller navigation.
A new configurator should make it easier for adjusting and creating custom controller configurations. And updated game overlay, system menu, and quick access menu should hopefully make jaunting around Steam&#x27;s interfaces easier.
A new lens
I&#x27;ve been spending more and more time using my Steam Deck, and have also used the old Steam Big Picture UI a fair bit, and have to say: this all feels like a good upgrade.
The user interface certainly isn&#x27;t the sole reason that Steam Decks are becoming pretty darn popular, but the general experience on them is solid. I&#x27;ve had little trouble navigating its menus or finding what I need to.
So for those who play PC on the TV or still have a Steam Link stashed away somewhere, this is nice to see. The beta is currently live to opt into and test out for yourself.

                              <span>This narrative adventure arrives before the year&#x27;s out
Somerville has locked in a launch date, and it&#x27;s surprisingly soon. The sci-fi adventure is set to hit on November 15, for Xbox consoles and PC.
Developer Jumpship dropped the release date in a new trailer today, confirming its November launch. Somerville is set to arrive on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, and is also coming to Xbox Game Pass.
This narrative thriller follows a family caught up in the immediate repercussions of an extraterrestrial conflict. As explosions and mysterious visitors descend, it looks like the player will be trying to keep their family whole as they escape.

We&#x27;ve been seeing teasers for Somerville for quite a while now. The IP is created by Chris Olsen and built in collaboration with former Playdead CEO and co-founder Dino Patti.
So yes, it has some of that Inside energy. Both side-scrolling action and tense sequences look to be in store here.
Out of this world
It&#x27;s a bit of a surprise, to suddenly see a date on Somerville. But it&#x27;s a very welcome one. Somerville has looked pretty striking in its appearances over the years at various showcases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jcjnHHxHV3o
This also bolsters out the Game Pass library, which is pretty nice. While I like being able to access just about every Halo and Fallout under the sun, the bonus of Game Pass has been seeing projects like these get a solid bump. Immortality and Signalis both hit the service at launch, and Obsidian&#x27;s upcoming historical RPG adventure Pentiment is also currently set for November.
November is looking like a good time to settle it for a weekend in Somerville.

Blaseball is, at its most distilled form, a sports game. Users join through the website and assign themselves to a team of choice, like the Houston Spies or Baltimore Crabs, either through regional loyalty or just digging their vibe. Each team is populated by generated players, who play out their games in A.I.-driven baseball games, like watching a bunch of CPU opponents fight in Super Smash Bros.
The teams play matches throughout the week, effectively simulating a season of baseball, and users bet in-game currency on the outcomes, akin to Salty Bet matc…</span>

                              <span>This level of gore isn&#x27;t for everyone... literally
With everything we&#x27;ve seen of The Callisto Protocol so far, it looks like it&#x27;s shaping up to be one of the goriest horror games we&#x27;ve seen in a long time -- and recent developments in graphical fidelity is only going to make the violence more intense. While it&#x27;s clear that the game won&#x27;t be for those with a weak stomach, some players won&#x27;t even be able to try it for themselves, because The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s release in Japan has been entirely canceled.
According to developer Striking Distance, the cancellation came following a dispute with the Japanese ratings board. Apparently the game in its current bloody, gory state can&#x27;t pass Computer Entertainment Rating Organization, or CERO, for certification. What it comes down to is that the boa…</span>

                              <span>A few places are sold out, but there will be more in the market
Although the set of three Splatoon 3 amiibo haven&#x27;t actually come out yet, we&#x27;re going back to Splatoon 2 this week in some form or another with a Splatoon 2 amiibo restock.
We knew this was coming, but as amiibo News points out, the figure trio are back today online, but several retailers are sold out of various stock: meaning, if you wanted to pick these up at some point, now isn&#x27;t a bad time. Amazon, Best Buy, and Gamestop have units in stock, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed any one of them will be in.
At the moment of publication, here is what seems to be available for the Splatoon 2 amiibo wave:
Amazon has the Inkling Boy (Green) and Inkling Squid (Purple) for slightly over MSRP
Best Buy has Inkling Boy (Green) fully in stock at MSRP
GameStop is currently out of stock, but may get more in
Here&#x27;s what the amiibo situation looks like going forward (2022-2023):
Splatoon Inkling (Yellow)
Octoling (Blue)
Smallfry
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora (still needs full confirmation)
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

We still have a few months left in the year, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Cult of the Lamb is one of the most memorable games to come out of 2022. It&#x27;s got the perfect balance of roguelike hack-and-slash action and engaging community sim mechanics, all wrapped up in an adorably twisted art style. I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but I honestly think Cult of the Lamb should be up as a Game of the Year contender, because it managed to blend some of our favorite gameplay mechanics to make one of the most unique titles we&#x27;ve seen in a while. If you haven&#x27;t gotten around to playing it yet, or you&#x27;re just a megafan, then you&#x27;re in luck -- pre-orders for physical copies Cult of the Lamb are now available for pre-order for PS5 and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Deadpool and Venom are among them
It&#x27;s a 2K game, so of course the Midnight Suns season pass is a thing. Announced this week via the below trailer (presented by Deadpool), it&#x27;ll bring more characters into the fray.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;blw2Q0YZI_E
Here&#x27;s what we have so far for the Midnight Suns season pass:
DLC Content Pack 1 - Deadpool - A foulmouthed mercenary with a heart of gold, Deadpool has a penchant for grisly violence and lighthearted, fourth-wall breaking wisecracks.
DLC Content Pack 2 - Venom - Spider-Man’s nemesis and one of the main game’s bosses, Venom turns playable hero in DLC #2, armed with all of the same symbiote attacks that once threatened the lives of the Midnight Suns.
DLC Content Pack 3 - Morbius - One of the original comic book Midnight Sons, Morbius is an accomplished biochemist who, in an attempt to cure his own rare blood disease, turned himself into a living vampire.
DLC Content Pack 4 - Storm - A powerful member of the X-Men, Storm has the ability to generate and manipulate wind, lightning, rain, and other types of weather to her will.
Yes, Deadpool makes a &quot;Morbin&#x27; Time&quot; joke in the video.
According to 2K, the pass will also be sprinkled with additional content beyond the characters; like more levels and items. Midnight Suns is still slated for a December 2 release on PC, PS4, PS5, and Series X/S. The Switch version and prior generations are allegedly coming later, though there&#x27;s no date in sight, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they were canceled.
As one of the last big games of 2022 , I think I speak for strategy and Marvel enthusiasts alike when I say that I hope this one is worth it. With Firaxis at the helm it&#x27;s really hard to go wrong, but putting big characters like this behind a season pass doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.

Sometimes games remove their DRM after the launch window, but not normally just five days after release, making its removal from Gotham Knights a surprise. 

Well, now Denuvo has been re-added.

The Ryzen 5600X costs the best part of £200, but the vanilla 5600 is down to £145 at Ebuyer - a great value in my book.

This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I&#x27;ve never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

                              <span>Today has brought the launch of Signalis, a new retro-styled survival horror about an android trapped in a spooky place in deep space. It looks neat! I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s good! I can neither confirm nor deny that because I can&#x27;t get past the main menu. The background is a big blinking eye, see, and it follows my mouse cursor, so I cannot resist making the eye look around and go silly. I don&#x27;t know how the devs expected players to beat this near-impossible first task of leaving the eye alone long enough to click the &quot;Begin&quot; button.

                              <span>I’ve mentioned before that I’m into survival games with a goal past staying alive, because if surviving is the only goal, what’s the point in living at all (he says, with a firm glare at the Tory party)? Grounded has its main quest and Minecraft has the Ender Dragon, for example, which gives you something to work towards past simply keeping your heart beating. 7 Days to Die is the biggest counterpoint to that, with its routine weekly horde attacks delivering moreish gameplay that keeps me playing way past my bedtime.

                              <span>Wanna get into the Halloween spirit but are a bit of a wimp (100% guilty), or just struggle with horror games in general (1000% guilty)? No worries; I got you. Here&#x27;s a list of the best spooky games for non-horror fans.
Don’t get me wrong, I love Halloween,  I just don’t want to have the bejesus scared outta me, you know? I like games that give me a lil bit of spooky-ookiness, but not like bone-chilling, stomach-churning, nightmare inducing, wont-sleep-for-a-week horror games. Absolutely not. You won’t find any Resident Evil or Silent Hill recommendations here! Feel safe knowing that the spooky-not-scary games you&#x27;ll find below will get you thoroughly into the Halloween mood, just without all the over-the-top violence and buckets of gore. Enjoy!

We&#x27;ve already seen quite a bit about Broken Moon, the brand new map being added with Season 15 - but now Respawn has finally released more details about the new Legend, Catalyst, and the Ferrofluid-powered abilities she brings to the Apex Games.
It turns out that part of Catalyst&#x27;s diverse skillset is an Ultimate ability that may at last provide some serious counterplay to the ever-present scan meta dominated by recon Legends such as Bloodhound and Seer. Take a look at Catalyst&#x27;s abilities in the new Season 15 vignette trailer below.

                              <span>Happy skeleton war month, ya filty animals! This week on the Electronic Wireless Show we talk about dread, as in, the thing Matthew feels when confronted with glistening food, or when he knows he has to record a podcast with us. We talk about some cracking scary games, going a bit down the beaten track and away from our normal path of least resistance (talking about Red Dead Redemption 2 and BioWare games). We also have some spooky recommendations for you to spice up your Halloween! Plus, it&#x27;s Nate turn to produce a Cavern Of Lies. More like Cavern Of Jump Scares! And we coin a couple of new euphemisms you&#x27;re sure to work into your every day language.

                              <span>Saturnalia isn&#x27;t a terribly long game, but it has spent much longer occupying my thoughts. Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I&#x27;d heard a strange rattling noise...
In fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they&#x27;re locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.

                              <span>A little while back, I went to Cornwall with some friends in the hopes we&#x27;d detox on lovely beaches and coastal walks. Somehow, we managed a mental cleanse between horrendous downpours that knocked us sideways and made our socks all soggy. And while we cocooned ourselves in metal and waited for these bouts of terrible weather to subside, we played disgusting amounts of Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla.
Over the course of a couple of weeks, we racked up a solid 60+ hours of game time. I&#x27;d wake up and see my friend clearing map markers. I&#x27;d pop out for a quick run (yes, I ran on my holiday like a chump) and return to see both of my friends clearing map markers. Did we enjoy it? Sometimes! But then, why couldn&#x27;t we stop playing? The Ubisoft Effect, I reckon.

Now, Firaxis have confirmed that, yep, Deadpool will be coming to Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, but only as part of its newly unveiled season pass.

                              <span>What&#x27;s better than a little city full of mysteries to solve? A mysterious little city trapped in a time loop, where you slowly learn all the secrets but no one remembers what you did last time around. That&#x27;s The Forgotten City, and if you&#x27;re on Game Pass, I do recommend having a go before it leaves Microsoft&#x27;s service next week. It&#x27;s a great puzzle box running to clockwork, like if Outer Wilds had you meddle with people&#x27;s lives rather than machinery.

                              <span>Game Of Thrones author George R. R. Martin has admitted he hasn’t played Elden Ring, despite creating the history and lore for FromSoftware’s RPG. He does have a fairly good reason for it, though. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Martin said, “I have not played it because people seem to want this Winds Of Winter book,” the (very) long-awaited sixth chapter in the Game Of Thrones series.

The changes will come into effect today, alongside the Moonbreaker&#x27;s first content update, Zax’s Story.

                              <span>BioWare have announced, via a blog post by general manager Gary McKay, that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in their fantasy RPG series, has completed its Alpha milestone. If that means nothing to you, BioWare describe it as the moment “a game all comes together… we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end.” The Dragon Age sequel was officially announced in 2018, but it was initially conceived as a game about wizard heists before restarting development. So, Dreadwolf&#x27;s progress should be encouraging to fans of the series.

                              <span>38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it&#x27;s particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that&#x27;s why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let&#x27;s quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it&#x27;s a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

Earlier this week we covered a deal for the 5800X3D in the US, and now we&#x27;re back to finish the job with a deal for the UK market. 
Right now Ebuyer are taking orders for the 5800X3D at £349, a solid £110 discount from its UK RRP. A lot of folks have already jumped on this deal, using up Ebuyer&#x27;s existing stock, but you can order now for delivery on October 31st - and get a spooky Halloween upgrade for your PC.

                              <span>Ahead of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s full release on October 28th, I’ve been using its campaign early access to get familiar with its inner PC workings. As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. 
After Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.

                              <span>I’m fairly sure that zombies are the perfect video game enemies. They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I&#x27;ve put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have the greatest understanding of how one is meant to play a real-time strategy game as a child. It wasn&#x27;t a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I&#x27;d had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I&#x27;d amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I&#x27;d tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

The team describe Nightmare as a “mind-shattering extradimensional take on the classic CoD zombies formula” with some emotional baggage on the side. Essentially, it’s a horror FPS that has you up against vampires, werewolves, and angels (the bad kind) across six biomes. This bite-sized FPS acts as a companion piece to next year’s El Paso, Elsewhere, the previously announced third-person shooter

The “full-fledged” remake of 2007’s RPG is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and will use the same toolsets that CDPR is creating for their upcoming Witcher trilogy. The studio call the project a “modern reimagining” and say they’re “updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it.”

In-between all the talking? Lots of slides and presentations and absolutely no hands anywhere near controllers. But finally, finally, I&#x27;ve played a 90-minute PS5 demo of The Callisto Protocol and can confirm that it felt like a last-gen game in a good way: all photorealistic sweat and blood scrawled on walls, coupled with 360-era exploration and fighting. Refreshingly familiar, I&#x27;d say.

                              <span>To celebrate Fallout&#x27;s 25th anniversary this week, Amazon Prime Video have released the first official glimpse of their upcoming Fallout TV show. Amazon posted a screengrab from the show on Twitter last night, depicting three Vault 33 dwellers staring at a silhouette coming in or out of the Vault - and what appears to be a body lying on the ground beside them. This is the first and only proper look we&#x27;ve had at the adaptation since August’s leaked set images mysteriously disappeared from the internet, but that hasn’t stopped fans from wildly theorising about what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that relocatable buildings are better than slide kicks. I often side with functionality over flash but honestly, this is gutting. Still, this is science, and I respect the process. Next up, I am asking you to choose between two things which, if we&#x27;re honest with ourselves, are both really about trying to be cool. What&#x27;s better: parrying projectiles or customisable horn honks?

                              <span>After the past three years, I’d have happily never heard the word &quot;plague&quot; again, let alone in the context of one of my favourite co-op games. Yet after an early play around with Deep Rock Galactic Season 3, I’m already sold that this update – which centers around a corrupting, planet-wide infection – could be its best one yet.
After repelling a robot-spamming rival corp across Seasons 1 and 2, your reward in Season 3 – which launches on November 3rd – is to find your mining operating pelted by a meteorite storm. And they’re carrying a nasty payload: Rockpox, a contagion that quickly infects both the caves of Hoxxes IV and the many, many giant bugs living within them. These sickly Glyphids and contaminated caverns will present you and your fellow space dwarves with some new perils, but also new opportunities to turn a management-pleasing profit. And isn’t providing value to shareholders why we’re all here to begin with?

                              <span>Nothing frightens me more than not being in control. The fear of an outside force pushing me into the corners of my mind and redecorating however they wish. It’s what should be scary about zombies when they’re not just mindless headshot fodder. This is also the main fear behind Endoparasitic, a top-down horror game released earlier this week. A research facility suffers a parasitic outbreak, leaving you with one arm, surrounded by mutated monsters. Oh, and you’re also infected by one of those deadly parasites I just mentioned. Jolly!

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s campaign may be the best it&#x27;s been for a long while. There&#x27;s great variety in the game&#x27;s first-person shooty bang with plenty of interesting ideas to break the illusion of it being an on-the-rails ride. Where it excels is in its action movie sequences, but it also takes itself too seriously at times and struggles to balance the sensitivities of conflict within its choppy story.

In fact, one of the core algorithms is created and publicly shared by  Deezer.

                              <span>Amid claims that live sports piracy in France was recently cut in half, anti-piracy agency Arcom says that 40% of illegal stream viewers observed at least one website block in 2022. In response, an impressive 15% decided to go legal, but others weren&#x27;t so readily converted. Close to half migrated to other pirate sites, with around 12% of blocked pirates deploying VPNs or modified DNS settings.

                              <span>Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio&#x27;s upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they&#x27;re leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line. 
Here is the statement in full:

                              <span>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red announced that it was developing a new Cyberpunk game, multiple Witcher games, and a new IP. One of those Witcher games was given the codename &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; and CDPR called it a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool&#x27;s Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool&#x27;s Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur&#x27;s Gate III, and Outriders.

                              <span>Team Ninja has revealed the release date for its upcoming action game set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and it&#x27;s less than half a year away. 
More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That&#x27;s less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let&#x27;s break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition
The steelbook launch edition of the game will include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a collector&#x27;s steelbook (yet to be revealed), and the Crown of Zhurong and Crown of Gonggong bonus DLC. It will also include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Digital Deluxe Edition
The digital deluxe edition will include a digital copy of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a digital art book, a digital mini soundtrack, and the game&#x27;s season pass. It will also include the Quinglong armor as a season pass bonus, the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus, and the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus. 
DLC
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will have a season pass and it will include three pieces of DLC, although Team Ninja has not detailed what to expect just yet. You can also buy these DLCs individually. Anyone that purchases the season pass will get the Qinglong armor as a bonus.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 processors are brilliant, often beating Intel 12th-gen offerings and drawing close with 13th-gen, while offering support for PCIe 5.0 SSDs, DDR5 RAM and a brand new AM5 socket. For content creation, they&#x27;re by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. 
Pound for pound, it&#x27;s by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it&#x27;s been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That&#x27;s a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides.

                              <span>Today marks the 25th anniversary of strategy classic Age Of Empires, and to celebrate Xbox Game Studios have announced a ream of updates coming to Age Of Empires II: Definitive Edition next year. Technically, the main bit of news from tonight&#x27;s anniversary stream is that both Age Of Empires II: DE and Age Of Empires IV will be arriving on Xbox consoles in 2023 (that, and Age Of Mythology is coming back), but the upshot of all that is that the PC versions will be getting the very same benefits, including controller support, crossplay with consoles and cloud gaming support.

                              <span>Shareware platformers defined my PC gaming as a kid. Yeah, a cheeky blast on Wolfenstein 3D was okay, but Commander Keen and Duke Nukem were an amazing discovery for a small person who’d been introduced to games through the NES. One of my all-time favourites is Apogee’s Crystal Caves, a gem of a platformer about an interstellar miner who goes space spelunking in search of alien crystals.

                              <span>Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.
If you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you&#x27;re looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam&#x27;s done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.

That all changed over the weekend when Umurangi’s composer, ThorHighHeels, posted a YouTube video showcasing three obscure horror games. A short teaser for Origame’s FiveSeven was mysteriously tucked in the middle of it.

                              <span>Last week I reviewed New Tales From The Borderlands and I really didn&#x27;t like it. This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don&#x27;t want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).
As it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I&#x27;m not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I&#x27;d sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn&#x27;t played it for a while. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t how I remembered. Maybe I&#x27;d changed, you know?

                              <span>When Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, first played the Age Of Empires series, he was still working at Westwood Studios on Command &amp; Conquer. “The first thing I was impressed about more than anything with this series was just like, wow! History! That&#x27;s really smart,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Like, there&#x27;s no need to explain anything to people. You don&#x27;t have to be like, oh, there&#x27;s a laser gun or this is a magic missile. It&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”


To Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it&#x27;s just outlasted everything else.”

Back in January, FromSoftware deactivated online features for the Dark Souls trilogy on PC due to the prominence of hackers and security concerns. Recently, Dark Souls III servers were reactivated (before being deactivated and reactivated again) and now it&#x27;s Dark Souls II’s turn. The base version of Dark Souls II will have these features “made available at a later date,&quot; but for now, Scholar Of The First Sin players can continue to invade the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and scribble down messages for others.

                              <span>The Activision Blizzard King Workers Alliance have teamed up with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union to file another charge of unfair labour practices against Activision Blizzard. The filing is in response to a message described as anti-union that was sent by Activision Blizzard’s communications executive, Lulu Meservey, to 18,000 employees last week. The CWA had previously filed a charge of unfair labour practices in September 2021, accusing the company of violating US labour laws and stopping employees from discussing working conditions. Last year’s complaint was closed just a month later.

Black content creators have been a significant part of The Sims&#x27; online presence for years, creating custom content, mods and more.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a &quot;gonzo, crazy, funny adventure&quot; and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

                              <span>Bethesda revealed Arkane Studios&#x27; open-world, co-op FPS Redfall back in 2021, and since then, the companies have been slowly pulling back the curtain on what to expect in this vampire-infested experience. We&#x27;ve received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we&#x27;ve even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new &quot;Into The Night&quot; Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there&#x27;s a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today&#x27;s trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it&#x27;d be such a great Halloween game – but it&#x27;s not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it&#x27;s released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s third chapter, it&#x27;s operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they&#x27;re running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It&#x27;s loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin&#x27; and hollerin&#x27; the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you&#x27;re staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…</span>

                              <span>Cult of the Lamb was released back in August and while the main story will run you a dozen or so hours, developer Massive Monsters are inviting you back to your base of operations with a new Blood Moon Festival update that&#x27;s now live. 
This limited-time event began yesterday (October 24) and will run until November 10. It brings plenty of new with it, too, so you&#x27;ll want to jump in to check out all of the Blood Moon&#x27;s offerings before it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s what to expect:
New Blood Moon Ritual
3 New Follower Forms to unlock
4 Base Decorations to unlock
New music track
To accompany the news, Massive Monsters have also released a new trailer for Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Blood Moon Festival update that you can watch below: 


&quot;Under the light of the Blood Moon, devotees can harvest pumpkins to unlock a brand new ritual that will raise former members of their cult, casting them back to the land of the living as wandering spirits,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;New follower forms and dreadful decorations will be granted upon their capture, but be quick about it, the Blood Moon will wane on November 10.&quot;

                              <span>One of Overwatch&#x27;s most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game&#x27;s loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year&#x27;s event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game&#x27;s Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

&quot;Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,&quot; a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. &quot;Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o&#x27;-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.&quot; 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

Grande, meanwhile, notes that the article was valuable enough to be documented by Warner&#x27;s anti-piracy expert.

Autoři opravili chování, kdy Tails občas v případě manuální aktualizace odkazoval na starší verzi release notes, nikoli na nejnovější. Jinak zde najdeme novější jádro Linux 5.10.149, které by opět o něco mělo vylepšit podporu novějšího hardwaru (GPU, Wi-Fi apod.).</span>

This is the second time the RPS Treehouse has gathered together to hash out our collective Bestest Bests from across the ages, and lemme tell you, this year&#x27;s list has seen tons of movement compared to last year&#x27;s ranking. Not only are there buckets of new entries, but there&#x27;s been plenty of upward and downward shuffling of old favourites, too. So come on in and find out what&#x27;s made the cut.

                              <span>The Radeon RX 6950 XT is the fastest AMD graphics card in the world, and will remain so until at least November when AMD is expected to announce a new range of next-gen GPUs. It originally debuted at $1000, undercutting the RTX 3090 Ti at $1500, but third-party models could cost much more - such as this $1200 PowerColor Red Devil. Today though, with that whole &#x27;impending release of better graphics cards&#x27; thing, the 6950 XT is down to $800 at Amazon, which is an awesome deal for the level of graphics performance on offer.

                              <span>Folks, I’ve got some bad news. Victoria 3 is not a game where you play the clone of the clone of Posh Spice. I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.
Trying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.

                              <span>The Corsair 5000D is a rather good PC case, but as it&#x27;s fairly new it&#x27;s normally quite expensive - like $165 on Amazon expensive. So it brings me good cheer to announce that Woot are doing the case in white or black for just $99.99, the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model.

                              <span>The Angel of Darkness gets blamed for a lot of the Tomb Raider franchise&#x27;s failures in the early-to-mid 2000s — whether it&#x27;s the downfall of Core Design, the box office flop of the second Angelina Jolie movie, or the continuity reboot the series needed before anyone would agree to publish another one of its games. While I have to admit there&#x27;s some pretty damning circumstantial evidence there and that not every accusation is exactly unfounded, the game&#x27;s memetic unpopularity even among people who never played it still feels harsher than is warranted.

                              <span>Horror games are great and all that, but what about games that make you the monster? Yeah. Chew on that for a second.

I&#x27;m not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.

                              <span>Alright folks, bear with me, because it doesn&#x27;t look like this one is going to get less messy. As reported by Tech News Space, it appears that Robert Kurvitz, the lead developer and writer on Disco Elysium, is suing Studio ZA/UM, the development studio of Disco Elysium, via his own company Telomer. Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice&#x27;s website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to &quot;obtain information and review documents&quot;, which you can see for yourself here.
This comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.

                              <span>House Castle has been on a bit of a horror binge this month, what with it being Spooky Season and all. Not because we&#x27;re die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we&#x27;re both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we&#x27;ve been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there&#x27;s been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I&#x27;ve often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.
I was beginning to think I&#x27;d lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It&#x27;s been a while, hasn&#x27;t it?

Greg upozorňuje na to, že se starší verzí je nyní konec a už nebude dostávat podporu upstreamu. Tato větev je nyní ukončena. V tuto chvíli byste měli přejít na větev 6.0.y.</span>

                              <span>PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games&#x27; &quot;immoral&quot; compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor&#x27;s original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor&#x27;s thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels &quot;the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry&quot; since &quot;some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger.&quot;

                              <span>The Cooler Master NR200P is one of the best small form factor PC cases on the market, but it normally costs around £100 - a fair amount of money. Today though, you can pick up the case for nearly half off, as CCL are selling this model for just £54.
For context, the last time we wrote about a big discount to this model, it was down to £76 - so this is the best deal we&#x27;ve ever seen on the NR200P by some margin!

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication.

                              <span>The season finale of HBO&#x27;s &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; has leaked online, two days ahead of its official premiere. The popular Game of Thrones prequel was already quite popular among pirates and this release is drawing even more attention. The source of the leak is unclear but the Hebrew subtitles could be a hint.

                              <span>EU Advocate General Maciej Szpunar has published his advice on potential liability for streaming platforms when subscribers use VPN services to bypass geo-blockades. According to the opinion, streaming services are not liable for VPN &#x27;pirates&#x27;, as long as they implement reasonable geo-blocking technology.

                              <span>This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake&#x27;s Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don&#x27;t steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.
This puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven&#x27;t played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you&#x27;re missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, &quot;Yes&quot;. The long answer is, &quot;Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably&quot;.

It&#x27;s about starting a job in a museum and archive based around a former tobacco plantation, and run by the extremely wealthy descendants of its owners. It&#x27;s not about what great people they were. It didn&#x27;t feel like trauma porn, but obviously I can only speak as a ludicrously white person from another country.
What it is definitely good at it is representing real historical research, and who gets to write the history that suits them.

                              <span>Anyone who’s played the charming Tunic knows that it’s a little cryptic. There’s an immediately nonsensical language to try and decipher, for one thing. Then you’ve got an in-game manual that’s been pulled apart, with pages strewn around the world to find before you can figure out how to do everything your little fox is capable of. Well, now audio designer Kevin Regamey has explained a whole other secret side to Tunic, and it turns out the game’s soundtrack hides a whole other language.

                              <span>As Ed detailed in his review earlier this week, Gotham Knights is a bit of a disappointing dud. I&#x27;ve also been picking my way through Gotham City as various members of the bat family, weightlessly punching dudes in alleys before crafting new sticks that hit 2% harder than the one I was using before. Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. 


It didn&#x27;t help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady&#x27;s trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.

The early access version of the game will allow you to fully travel around the Kerbolar system - can’t quite believe I typed that - which has been given a major overhaul since the first game. There’ll also be more than 350 new parts to build your spacecraft with. You can watch a lengthy chat with the Kerbal team about their early access mission below.

                              <span>Last night, I caught up with a dear old friend the classic way: over a round of Left 4 Dead 2. Valve&#x27;s cooperative FPS is still a great hangout game after 13 years but while waiting for my pal to log on, I did think I might refresh it by browsing the Steam Workshop and installing some popular mods. Turns out, modders have made lots of anime girls and VTuber avatars to replace friends, enemies, and even guns. What an experience! It is startling to discover that the blue-haired anime approaching you is not a teammate but, in fact, a vomit-filled Boomer.

                              <span>In typically British, self-deprecating fashion, I’m happy to admit I’m not very good at Soulslike games, the massively successful Elden Ring included. That’s why I raised an intrigued eyebrow while sipping my seventeenth cup of tea today, after I saw Twitch streamer Luality playing FromSoftware’s latest with just a drawing tablet. Taking on the challenge with admirable confidence, Luality used a virtual keyboard on the tablet’s left side for movement, and bound strokes of the stylus to attack its enormous monsters.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I&#x27;ve been banging my head against all week. It&#x27;s an uphill fort siege where you&#x27;re facing off against an evil necromancer who&#x27;s shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone&#x27;s mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you&#x27;ve just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. 
Tactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it&#x27;s clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you&#x27;d learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I&#x27;m still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn&#x27;s opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.

This time, it’s a beta update that lets you peek inside your Deck without busting the device open. So if you were thinking of hanging your Steam Deck up like a piñata today and whacking it with a big stick to see what goodies are hiding in there, just grab the client beta update instead. You can opt in by heading to Settings, selecting System, and then the Steam Update Channel.

The expansion is part of devs Hinterland Studio’s efforts to make further improvements to the game’s Survival Mode, and will be split into multiple releases over twelve months. I’m getting a Stranger Things season four vibe from what’s been shown so far. You can see for yourself by watching the short, and quite dark, teaser trailer below.

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more. 
Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a gr…</span>

                              <span>The piracy liability trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande Communications is underway. When the parties presented their opening statements, Grande informed the jury that it will present a witness who has spoken to multiple innocent infringers.

Arguably the biggest news from the presentation is that Bloober Team, the developer behind The Medium and other horror games, is remaking Silent Hill 2. The trailer for the game showed scenes from the iconic game with all-new visuals. The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to PC via Steam and will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for at least a year after launch.


Konami followed up with Silent Hill Townfall, a new game from developer No Code, the creators of Observation and Stories Untold. The teaser shared for the game offered little in the way of game details, but the implication is that it will be someth…</span>

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of rumors, leaks, and speculation regarding the future of Silent Hill, Konami is finally revealing what’s next for the long-dormant franchise. The publisher is airing a special presentation that promises new Silent Hill reveals today at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. Could it be the much-rumored Silent Hill 2 remake by Bloober Team? Confirmation of the seemingly leaked Silent Hill: The Short Message? Whatever it winds up being, come and watch the event along with us!
Editors Marcus Stewart and the freshly returned Kyle Hilliard will be streaming and reacting to the Silent Hill transmission on Twitch beginning about 10-15 mins before the festivities begin (roughly 3:30 p.m. Central/4:30 p.m Eastern). Come hang with them along with the rest of the GI community and share excitement (or disappointment) at what Konami has in store. Missed the stream? Watch the YouTube version below!

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

                              <span>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…</span>

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>
