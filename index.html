                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.

The week is almost over and that means it&#x27;s time for another edition of What Are You Playing!
This week was a little quiet in Nintendo Land after last week&#x27;s Pokémon shenanigans, but there was still plenty to keep us entertained. We got a free demo for Princess Peach: Showtime! which might have even given us a sneak peek at the developer. A new Pokémon ad suggested that the 3DS is now &#x27;retro&#x27; *shivers* and rumours began to pick up about Nintendo news in store for MAR10 Day.

I first encountered Papers, Please when Jacksepticeye did his play-through eight years ago (he’s played it again since, four years ago) and immediately rushed to download the game. It appealed to my inner detective, my knack for discovering secrets and my desire to pay attention to detail.

The game, developed by Lucas Pope and published by 3039, became a phenomenon, receiving hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of views on YouTube alone. On Steam alone it’s been downloaded 4.3 million times and has won a lot of …</span>

                              <span>Squaresoft went all out in when they decided to grow Final Fantasy VII from a humble multimillion-selling game to a whole series. 


To that end, they created the &quot;Final Fantasy VII Compilation,&quot; an ambitious collection of cross-media FFVII titles that would conquer the world. The initiative met a lukewarm response from the public, with the only very well-received title coming out of it being Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, a prequel to FFVII. However, many have forgotten that Compilation tried to set up a character who could replace Sephiroth in future games. 




Where is Genesis Rhapsodos, Final Fantasy VII&#x27;s new Sephiroth, now?

This is not what most wanted, but I&#x27;d recommend you not to fret too much, as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s character creator — as well as the game itself — seems to be set to become an all-timer.


Games with in-depth character creator modes aren&#x27;t that rare a thing nowadays, but not all games feature fanbases filled with incredibly passionate and artful fans, and the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 team sure does have that. It&#x27;s been such a short while since the release of the demo, and fans have already come up with spectacular renditions of many other video game and real-life characters. It&#x27;s time for an art showcase.

                              <span>As you&#x27;ve likely learned by now from a shocked and possibly teary-eyed adult man, Akira Toriyama, the legendary Mangaka who also became a legendary game developer on the side, has sadly passed away at the age of 68. 


In my opinion, Akira Toriyama immediately earned the status of everyone&#x27;s honorary dad when he came up with Goku, one of the most positive role models in the history of art that a kid could ever find. Unsurprisingly, it seems like he was a pretty great actual dad as well, looking at how he left the absolute most heartwarming message imaginable to his children on Chrono Trigger.

                              <span>The earth trembles in anticipation of Deathwing&#x27;s re-emergence of Cataclysm Classic. The re-launch of the World of Warcraft expansion that literally changed the world is now available in closed beta. You can experience all the fun of a dragon-fueled apocalypse now by signing up at Blizzard&#x27;s portal.


Cataclysm was a huge expansion, and WoW&#x27;s most monumental undertaking. The entirety of the main world was rebuilt for new stories, quests, locations and more. The expansion also saw the introduction of the Worgen and Goblins as playable races, the Archeology skill, and transmogrification. The ability to change your gear&#x27;s appearance continues to be one of the most important features for style-savvy players.

These optional quests award in more experience points and Requisition Slips, so they&#x27;re worth tracking down. Here&#x27;s how to find them.


A good way to find out what missions include Secondary Objectives is by looking for the light blue icons on the maps before you begin. From my experience, Secondary Objectives start appearing at Medium difficulty and beyond. Look for blue icons that can look something like crashed pods with smoke or beakers. These icons indicate a Secondary Objective, and their location on the map can usually be seen before the mission starts.

                              <span>Just in time for the Trial of Style later this month, the Dreadlord&#x27;s Regalia armor set is now for sale in World of Warcraft. This fancy new armor set helps you dress like one of Azeroth&#x27;s greatest enemies: The Nathrezim. It&#x27;s available now for $20 in the in-game store. 


The set comes with two fashionable colors to best suit your most diabolical transmog. Both variants, the Shadowbane and Venombane sets, give you the whole usual getup  — helm, shoulderpads, breeches, wings and all.

We recently learned a lot more about The Dreadlords in the previous WoW expansion, Shadowlands. What we thought was another group within The Burning Legion turned out to be a faction from the realm of death. They&#x27;ve managed to infiltrate virtually every organization in the known cosmos. At least, according to a report of theirs. 


These vampire-adjacent monsters are responsible for some of the most terrible atrocities on Azeroth. They guided the invasion of The Burning Legion, the creation of The Lich King, and even The Jailer&#x27;s attempt to remake reality. The Unseen Guests, as they&#x27;re also known, have been a thorn in players&#x27; sides since WarCraft III. 


While it might be easy to think we&#x27;ve put an end to their sprawling, chaotic schemes; celebrations may be premature. For what better way to hide from your enemies than by having them dress like you? A truly cunning idea, is it not? Beware what you wear...

                              <span>Interrogating enemies in Call of Duty: Warzone is a useful tactic to locate the enemy team. Like using Caveira in Rainbow Six: Siege, a downed player can be interrogated to reveal their teammates&#x27; location. However, right now, the mechanic is causing a game-breaking bug that&#x27;s probably not worth the risk. Better to hold off and find those enemy locations the old fashioned way.


Interrogating in Warzone can prevent you from swapping weapons


According to a recent post from Call of Duty Updates on Twitter, an issue is under investigation where interrogating downed enemy players can prevent you from swapping weapons. The developer Trello board says the bug is active in Battle Royale, Resurgence, Plunder, and Lockdown game modes. The investigation began on Thursday, March 7.




Until the developers provide an update on the status of this bug, it might be worth not interrogating anyone. Swapping weapons is a rather important ability for many reasons. As such, the few seconds of locating an enemy&#x27;s teammates probably isn&#x27;t worth the risk. Especially in Battle Royale, where you can&#x27;t exactly just die and reset very easily. 


In other game modes, like Resurgence, there are better methods of pinging enemies on your radar. For those unaware, killing an enemy in Resurgence game modes automatically pings the rest of their team on your radar for a few seconds. As such, it&#x27;s incredibly useful for players who move around and hunt for kills a lot. Flying around Fortune&#x27;s Keep in the castle or another close-quarters map is much easier to survive if you know where your dead enemies&#x27; friends are.

                              <span>With the sad passing of Dragon Ball Z creator Akira Toriyama, Final Fantasy XIV players have come together across the world to pay tribute to a hero and legend of the anime sphere. Since news of Toriyama&#x27;s passing broke, players have gathered outside the Pugilist’s guild in Ul’dah, many dressed as some of the creator&#x27;s most beloved characters.


Although best known for creating the foundational world of Dragon Ball Z, Toriyama was also renowned for his work on much-loved RPGs. From his character designs in Chrono Trigger to striking designs in Dragon Quest, Toriyama touched artists and fans within the world of anime, manga, and video games.

It doesn’t matter which server you play on, it’s hard to miss the gathering of players in Ul’dah, decked out in cosplay in homages to the life’s works of Toriyama. There’s no end to the Goku outfits, and hundreds of people donning the Slime Crown and Thug’s Mug glamour items, inspired by Dragon Quest, and rewarded during the Breaking Brick Mountains event last held in 2021. 


As they always do in sad times like these, players are utilising the Wanderer’s Campfire minion to light the streets of Ul’dah, and they’re likely to remain in their chosen spot for hours, or even days, in remembrance of Toriyama and all he gave to the world during his life. 




It’s not the first time Final Fantasy XIV players have come together in honor of a treasured artist; back in 2021, the community came together after the death of Kentaro Miura, creator of the infamous Manga Berserk. Thousands of Dark Knights on every server lined the streets of Ul’dah in his memory, just as we’re seeing them do today. The community also gathered again for one of their own, Stephen Critchlow, who voiced Count Edmont de Fortemps in the Heavensward expansion.

                              <span>This is certainly a unique way to revive an old license. Slave Zero was a 1999 Infogrames title for Dreamcast and PC. Infogrames became Atari, which has links to Ziggurat Games, which works with publisher Tommo. So, the rights have been swirling around this big bucket.


That’s maybe not important. What is important is that someone at Ziggurat or Poppy Works identified it as fertile ground for a revival, even though the original wasn’t entirely acclaimed. Then, Poppy Works discarded basically everything about Slave Zero and somehow created something that pays respect to the original but is a completely original concept.


The result is fascinating. At a glance, you wouldn’t link Slave Zero X with its supposed progenitor. It’s an entirely new thing. And yet, somehow, it still adds value to …</span>

                              <span>Various outlets are reporting that the influential creator of Dragon Ball and character designer for games like the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger, Akira Toriyama, died on March 1 of a subdural hematoma.


You’d be hard-pressed to find a game developer in Japan who wasn’t influenced by Toriyama in some way. His work on Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball has pervaded the culture there and even found popularity in the West. Because of this recognition, he was tapped to design the characters for Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in North America) which itself became a cultural phenomenon in its home country.


As Streets of Rage and Actraiser composer Yuzo Koshiro put it on Twitter, “Toriyama’s work, with its unique art style, captivating characters, and warm, comforting stories, really made an impact on us kids.”


From there, Toriyama continued to work on the Dragon Quest series throughout his life. He later assisted with the creation of Chrono Trigger, often cited as one of the best RPGs ever made. He also lent his character design to the Tobal series and Blue Dragon. April will see the release of the adaptation of his manga, Sand Land.


This comes as quite a shock. Many people, including myself and the rest of Destructoid, are deeply saddened by this. But while Akira Toriyama may have passed too soon, his influence and his works will live on for a long, long time.

As it is a walking tank, the big toy does have a steep price tag. But there&#x27;s good news for those who want to play with it right away.


With Tien Kwan now liberated, Helldivers 2 players can acquire the freshly unlocked mech Exosuit. The Exo-45 Patriot Exosuit Stratagem is available for purchase under the &#x27;Stratagems&#x27; tab in the &#x27;Ship Management&#x27; area of your Destroyer ship. You need to be level 25 to unlock it for purchase, and then spend 20,000 Requisition Slips to add it to your arsenal.

                              <span>The Pig is an incredibly versatile Killer in Dead by Daylight. She can crouch and pounce at Survivors, plus use the Saw franchise&#x27;s iconic Reverse Bear Traps to force them out of hiding in search of keys to remove her torturous devices. However, the lengthy timer on these traps has been somewhat of a sore spot for Killer mains—that is, until now as Survivors will have far less time to escape their fate.


Today, Behaviour Interactive released its Developer Update preview for the upcoming All Things Wicked Chapter in Dead by Daylight. While these are still subject to change, the notes for the new Killer, Survivor, and map are likely to change before they launch on March 12. The biggest news from these patch notes isn&#x27;t related to that Chapter, though. It&#x27;s all about how The Pig&#x27;s ability is…</span>

                              <span>The Disney Dreamlight Valley Premium Shop is no stranger to controversy and one of the latest additions, the Small Pink Wings, have caused a bit of backlash within the player community and renewed a call for an item preview function. 


Ever since it was introduced back in February 2023, the Premium Shop has offered players a chance to get their hands on unique items or items from past Star Path events. From the beginning, there was discourse among players due to the price of items, but it has gone on to become a popular addition to the game. 


However, the Premium Store is now a year old and it&#x27;s still missing one much-desired feature — the ability to preview items before purchasing. While clothing items are displayed on a mannequin, wings aren’t. This is the main issue that has caused the latest controversy.


Disney Dreamlight Valley Small Pink Wings controversy

There have been four different varieties of wings that have been featured as possible purchases in the Premium Store (shown above). Judging from the photos and the price of the latest set, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the Small Pink Wings would be a similar size to the other three. 


Sadly, you’d be wrong and it’s this fact that has caused upset within the Dreamlight Valley community. 




As it turns out, the wings are absolutely tiny and players feel as though they’ve been misled with the Premium Shop image, understandably, and the argument for some form of preview function has become all the stronger as a result.

On the plus side, these wings have sparked a slew of jokes involving Heimlich from A Bug’s Life, after he gains his rather tiny wings and turns into a ‘beautiful butterfly’. Reddit comments are filled with people sharing images and gifs of the underrated character, causing others to state that they now actually want the wings in light of the comparison.

                              <span>Since releasing to early access over ten years ago, Rust has become one of the most famous online survival games in the current era. I say &quot;famous&quot; when I really mean &quot;infamous&quot; because, as anyone who&#x27;s played the game knows, it&#x27;s hard as frick. What we really need is a tutorial.


Ta-da! As of now, the latest patch for Rust has started rolling out which, low and behold, implements a Tutorial Island, perfect for getting to grips with the fundamentals. According to a post over on Steam, the island offers a way of adding a &quot;safe environment to learn the basic controls and mechanics of Rust before being set loose in the main game with other players.&quot;




It also says that all players will be prompted to run through the tutorial &quot;when they first spawn this month,&quot; but you can decline the offer. Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll learn:



Basic movement


Crafting


Building bases


Upgrading bases


Respawning


Basic combat


Resources


Looting containers


Cooking


Using Furnaces


Workbenches


Using a vehicle



No mention of how to cope with being screamed at by aggressive teens


That&#x27;s probably one of the biggest things to come out of this update. But there&#x27;s also another huge improvement that&#x27;s been made to Rust in the guise of better night lighting.


The update notes go on to say that to combat &quot;gamma hacking&quot; from players, the studio has added a &quot;Nightlight feature.&quot; Essentially, this is a shader that illuminates the immediate area in front of you at nighttime, &quot;mimicking the effect of natural moon light.&quot;


In short: you should now be able to see much better in the dark. It&#x27;s still going to be pretty dark, though, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to confidently run through the inky blackness with nary a care in the world. This is Rust, after all.

                              <span>Though the first major update for Helldivers 2 focused mainly on weapon and Stratagem rebalancing, the player base has known for some time now that Arrowhead Studios is gearing up for the release of mechs and assorted vehicles. Now, out of the blue, some Helldivers have come across these mechs.


More specifically, the ongoing push and pull between Super Earth and the opposing factions has now focused on the planet of Tien Kwan. If that name sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because this is where Super Earth&#x27;s mecha production factories are located, and the Automatons have mounted an assault on the planet. Now, with the community focused mainly on beating back Automaton forces, particularly lucky players have begun reporting usable mechs just waiting around for someone to jump into them to wreak som…</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;ve kind of become used to the idea of monthly subscriptions for our gaming needs. But if even that&#x27;s too much for you, Nvidia has now made it possible to utilize its cloud gaming service on a daily basis.


As reported by Videocardz, you can now purchase a Day Pass for GeForce NOW, which gives you access to Nvidia&#x27;s servers, powered by the RTX 4000-series graphics cards. It comes in two flavors as well: Priority and Ultimate, similar to the monthly memberships.




As for what you get, well, you&#x27;ll be entitled to 24-hour access to Team Green&#x27;s cloud, which includes all the usual benefits of a typical subscription, but without actually having to subscribe for a month or beyond.


But not 24-hour gaming


It should be said that you won&#x27;t get to play your games through GeForce NOW for the full 24 hours. Depending on which tier you opt for, you&#x27;ll get either six or eight hours of actual game time, but you&#x27;ll have access to the servers for the entire day.


According to the sign-up page on Nvidia&#x27;s website, you can pay $3.99 for the Priority Day Pass or $7.99 for Ultimate. The latter is said to have &quot;exclusive access&quot; to the RTX 4080 servers. You&#x27;ll also benefit from up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.


Oh, but if you want to try before you buy, the report from Videocardz says there&#x27;s an option to get a free hour-long session, but I couldn&#x27;t see where you would sign up for that. It also comes with ads, because we are, in actuality, living in an episode of Black Mirror (what a cool reference).

                              <span>With reports that Embracer Group allegedly cancelled an upcoming Deus Ex game, hopes of a return to the series have been fading. The industry is in a sad state now, so if you want to cheer yourself up with a dose of Adam Jensen, you can pick up Mankind Divided for free next week.


That&#x27;s one of the titles being given away over on Epic Games Store. The other is an indie puzzle from 2013 called The Bridge. Both will be available between March 14 and March 21. They will be replacing the sci-fi combat game Astro Duel 2.




While it may not be the most lauded Deus Ex entry out there, it&#x27;s still a nice little freebie for those who have yet to play it.


You can&#x27;t resist all that sincere moping


Things are so up in the air for Eidos-Montreal&#x27;s celebrated series. With voice actor Elias Toufexis being told to stop talking so much about Adam Jensen, there&#x27;s definitely a sense that we won&#x27;t ever get to see a follow-up to Mankind Divided.


It&#x27;s a story we&#x27;re all getting sick of hearing, no doubt. The video game industry is in dire straits at the moment, as huge publishers issue redundancies and studio closures. Eidos was one of those recently, which effectively put a nail in the Deus Ex coffin. Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to keep up with the amount of job losses that have occurred these past 12 months or so.


While we won&#x27;t likely get to see a new Deus Ex entry, maybe take some comfort in being able to get a copy of the latest installment for free. Sorry, didn&#x27;t mean to bring the mood down there.

                              <span>Though it&#x27;ll be a while before you directly deal with the more angelic characters of Unicorn Overlord, you can recruit one specific fighter quite early on. Ochlys is a Feathersword, a Flying-type unit with some excellent mobility. You&#x27;ll need to gather some shards to recruit her first, though.

Where to start The Winged Knight


First, to even meet Ochlys, you&#x27;ll need to head to Treyes Village to start The Winged Knight side quest. You can take the path south from Thulust Harbor and head east at the fork, past Fort Mainteneaut, to find the battle.


After speaking with Ochlys, you&#x27;ll need to help her reclaim Rondmort Church from some local bandits, whose forces you might remember. It&#x27;s an Enemy Level 4 fight, which shouldn&#x27;t be too tough.

Up to five Arisen &amp; Pawns


Instead of spending hours on release day figuring out exactly what Race and Class you want to make your character and Main Pawn, you can do so now and jump right into Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 when it releases on March 22. According to Capcom the data can be saved and then easily transferred to the full game on release.

Targeted repositories included pirate apps and games, as well as hundreds of RARBG backups. The number of takedowns has increased significantly in recent years. However, legitimate projects have grown faster and GitHub says it continues to take a developer-first approach.

Good news for deckbuilding fans itching to play the indie smash hit Balatro, as the game has returned to the Switch eShop today in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
Just a week ago, the game disappeared from Switch storefronts due to &quot;a reaction to an overnight change to Balatro&#x27;s age rating&quot;.

It&#x27;s impossible to overstate the impact of Akira Toriyama, the legendary manga artist and character designer who has been working in the manga industry since 1978. His death at 68 years old has thousands around the world mourning his loss.
Toriyama was, to me, comfort on sick days or after school. I&#x27;d watch episodes of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z on Toonami.

For a short while, LEGO Fortnite seemed to be pretty popular. Blending Lego with survival mechanics worked wonders and brought in a whole new player base to the free-to-play online battle royal. But today, Epic has announced LEGO Kits, new buildings that you&#x27;ll be able to create and add to your villages.

We have all dreamed about having a Pokémon in real life, right? We know that the Toyota Engineering Society sure has as last year&#x27;s &#x27;Miraidon Project&#x27; has brought the Pokémon Violet legendary to life in the coolest way possible (thanks, GamesRadar).
It&#x27;s a motorbike. They have turned Miraidon into a motorbike. Now, we know what you&#x27;re thinking, surely a project like this runs the risk of looking a bit naff. Won&#x27;t it very obviously be a bike with various parts stuck to it? Oh no, dear friends. These are Toyota engineers that we are talking about here, and it looks wicked.

The LEGO Animal Crossing sets released in March 2024 feature a range of different minifigures and island elements bringing back memories of 2020&#x27;s Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the form of everyone&#x27;s favourite plastic bricks.
As we run through each of the sets to see which one is best, here we&#x27;re looking at Isabelle&#x27;s House Visit — a particularly interesting example as it&#x27;s the only one to contain the series&#x27; inimitable mayoral assistance and admin extraordinaire, the loyal and lovely Isabelle.

When we first got wind that Expeditions: A MudRunner Game was on its way to Nintendo Switch, we gotta admit, we were a little bit surprised. This new entry in Saber Interactive&#x27;s superb off-road sim series takes the whole mud-running malarkey to a new level, with larger maps, loads more fine details, and improved physics over its well-regarded predecessors. How on earth was this big, modern, physics-heavy driving game going to run in handheld mode on a seven-year-old console?
Well, as it turns out, not without some fairly notable issues. However, we will say straight off the bat that if this is your only way to play, or you&#x27;re just a big fan of the previous games, you&#x27;ll likely be able to overlook most of the roadblocks. But let&#x27;s quickly run through the overall deal with what&#x27;s different between this new entry and the sublime Snowrunner first.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>While speaking to Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida in Square Enix&#x27;s Tokyo, Japan, offices last year for Game Informer&#x27;s cover story on the game, he told me there was currently no plans for DLC. However, a few months after the game&#x27;s June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. 
The first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don&#x27;t know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here.

                              <span>Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.
The news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama&#x27;s manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama&#x27;s family. You can read the full letter below.

Akira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. 
Upcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. 
Toryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama&#x27;s influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.
Game Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.</span>

Final Fantasy XVI, the latest wholly new single-player installment in one of gaming’s most storied franchises, is nearing its first anniversary this June. After the surprise release of its Echoes of the Fallen DLC, which focused Clive and Co.’s efforts on combat in a single dungeon, Square Enix is readying its final announced batch of FFXVI content with The Rising Tide DLC. Announced at The Game Awards back in December alongside the reveal and shadow drop of Echoes of the Fallen, The Rising Tide features Leviathan, the water Eikon mysteriously absent from the main game’s events.

Sometimes, a great idea can come from a simple premise. That’s how Son and Bone, the next game from TeamKill Media, the studio behind last year’s Quantum Error, came to be: a first-person shooter where you kill dinosaurs. Inspired by the dormant Turok series, TeamKill’s lead developer Micah Jones remarks about a joke the studio’s fans have made since the reveal of its dinosaur shooter at the top of the year. “They say, ‘If other game companies won’t do it, these developers will,’” Jones says, explaining that everyone on the team is a big fan of the Turok series.
After watching roughly 10 minutes of new Son and Bone gameplay, the Turok inspiration is…</span>

                              <span>Remember when Ubisoft announced they were working on a movie adaptation of hacking series Watch Dogs, before it was even released? I sure didn’t! Well, allow us both to be reminded of something from over a decade ago, because the Watch Dogs film is still apparently A Thing. It’s more of A Thing now, too, because it has actual names attached rather than just a corporation’s vague “excitement” about licensing out its IP.

                              <span>I like a good management game, but my definition of &quot;good&quot; often includes words like &quot;detailed&quot;, &quot;complex&quot;, or &quot;dangerously all-consuming&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t mean, though, that I don&#x27;t appreciate something light and simple now and then. In fact, Minami Lane might barely qualify as a management game by some standards.
There&#x27;s no real pressure, no chance of failure, and its limit of a handful of levels lasting perhaps three or four hours just about taps it out. But sometimes such limitations are intentional, and exactly what you want from a game.

                              <span>I&#x27;m beginning to think we should bury Vampire: The Masquerade back in the forsaken graveyard where it was originally dug up, or at least banish the toothy reprobate back to its pen &amp; paper castle. I don&#x27;t know how White Wolf&#x27;s RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don&#x27;t come gibbering to me about 2022&#x27;s Swansong, it wasn&#x27;t fit to polish Bloodlines&#x27; fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it.
Which brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series&#x27; first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It&#x27;s too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.

                              <span>High was the sun and gladsome the breeze when Dragonkin Skywalker, Donald Duck and the Lady Galadriel arrived in the city of Vernworth, there to make new friends and disturb the peace. Oh sorry, let me back up a bit: this is the second chapter of my Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 hands-on diary, in which I experiment with fielding a party consisting exclusively of spell-casters.

                              <span>The second part of Dune is out at the moment, and it has resulted in that most filthy of perversions, discourse - a pastime in which only the most unsavoury characters indulge. Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that&#x27;s the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going &quot;Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.&quot;
&quot;We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,&quot; reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you. I am of course being facetious. There is still religion and politics in Dune: Awakening, as confirmed by the statement, but you yourself aren&#x27;t doing much of it.

                              <span>If you wanted to buy any of the games in the Command &amp; Conquer Ultimate Collection, Dungeon Keeper, or Sim City 3000 - but didn&#x27;t want to do it on GOG where they were already on sale - then rejoice! EA has made these classics and more, and for some reason The Saboteur, available on Steam for the first time. You can see the full list of games here. I don&#x27;t have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it&#x27;s very funny that the list goes, like, &quot;beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s&quot;. Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is, in fact, &quot;real meat&quot;. There&#x27;s been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game&#x27;s scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon&#x27;s Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.

                              <span>Ahead of launching Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 later this month, Capcom have released its character creator for free as a separate standalone doodad. You can create your character and your main Pawn (NPC sidekick) and save them to use in the full game. Or, if you&#x27;re like me and cannot resist playing for hours in a character creator, you can enjoy fiddling with its many sliders and marvelling at the breadth of options like 334 different colours for its four eye colour settings and the ability to remove individual teeth. I made my kitten as my pal, because I guess that&#x27;s what I do now.

It&#x27;s the work of Suspicious Developments, the studio founded by former videogames journalist and  - *engage mystic rite of disclaiming* - RPS contributor Tom Francis, and lets you do things like chain lightning bolts around cover and knock people into mystic portals or out of windows (a Suspicious Developments staple).

                              <span>One of the sillier aspects of the original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma was accidentally falling head over heels for some rando innkeeper, and having them appear beside you as your sweetheart during the ending scenes, much to the surprise of many players who didn&#x27;t realise they were hitting on every NPC they did a favour for. 


The game&#x27;s Affinity system saw NPCs organically forming an attachment to players when you interacted with them, gave them things or carried out tasks for them. Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as &quot;Beloved&quot; and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it&#x27;s within your power.

                              <span>In further confirmation that one can never truly own digital media, Warner Bros. Discovery has decided to &quot;retire&quot; 2016&#x27;s noodling around puzzle game Small Radios Big Televisions - meaning it&#x27;ll disappear off storefronts in the next 60 days. Developer Owen Deery revealed this news on Xitter a couple of days ago, simultaneously announcing that the game is now free to download. Deery also noted you can buy the synthy soundtrack to show support.

                              <span>This week Steam unveiled a couple of changes. Your shopping basket from the Steam store is now shared between devices, so if you put something in there on browser you can finish it up on your Steam Deck. But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can&#x27;t see when you&#x27;re playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week&#x27;s podcast. Plus: we&#x27;ve been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!

                              <span>Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.
This first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn&#x27;t really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it&#x27;s a bit scrappy and sometimes it&#x27;s knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.

                              <span>Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It&#x27;s not clear why she&#x27;s attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm&#x27;s way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.
It was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it&#x27;s now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco&#x27;s offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening&#x27;s certainly got its work cut out for it.

                              <span>The two-person studio behind 2021&#x27;s tip-top top-down action-RPG Unsighted yesterday announced their next game, a 3D metroidvania named Abyss X Zero. It&#x27;s not out for a while yet but its look already reminds me of two things: the pleasingly clean art style of Mega Man Legends and the edgy anime schoolgirl styles of Kill La Kill.

                              <span>Io games are increasingly popular, to the point that you&#x27;ve probably heard of at least one, even if you didn&#x27;t realize it. Beginning back in 2015, io games made a huge debut and were some of the most popular titles on the market all the way through 2018, with even PewDiePie once declaring an io game to be his &quot;new favorite game.&quot; Now that’s some popularity.


Nowadays, there are still loads of active io games for players to enjoy or just try out. There are way too many to list, but there are a few that are worth checking out. Here are the eight best io games you can play right now.

                              <span>While no live-action film of Final Fantasy VII has been announced, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine Hollywood doesn&#x27;t at least have an overly eager eye on it. Depending on perspective, that&#x27;s either a threat or delight to muse over, especially when you consider Square Enix isn&#x27;t too shy to flirt with the big screen  — looking at you, Spirits Within and Advent Children. 


For better or for worse, I often find myself musing over ideal actors for the inevitable, like Zelda or Shadow. So, in case Hollywood goes for it, I&#x27;m shouting out my choices now. In honor of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&#x27;s launch, here are my picks for a live-action FF7 cast that I think, if made now, would be worthy of such a classic legacy.

                              <span>Chiori is a 5-star Geo character in Genshin Impact whose damage scales with both ATK and DEF stats. Because DEF is important to Chiori, you will want to Ascend her to level 90 as soon as possible. Here are all of Chiori’s Ascension materials you’ll need to achieve that goal!


Character Ascension


Coppelia


Chiori uses the purple Ousia version of Artificed Spare Clockwork Components as her boss materials. The Icewind Suite duo can be found near the Opera Epiclese. Talk to Maillardet and be sure to choose the “Dirge of Coppelia” challenge each time you fight this boss.


You’ll need 46 Components in total, which will take an average of 18 boss runs or about 720 Resin at World Level 8.


Dendrobium


Chiori requires Dendrobiums, the Inazuman local specialty. It can be found growing in old …</span>

                              <span>Of all the &#x27;tank&#x27; enemies in Helldivers 2, only one is an actual freakin&#x27; tank. The Annihilator Tank is the Automaton answer to the age-old question of &quot;Where did that hole in my chest come from?&quot; Good thing it&#x27;s not too tough to kill a Tank in Helldivers 2.


Granted, taking one out does require you to not be standing in front of it. Much like other vehicles (such as Helldiver 2&#x27;s own Hulk) the Annihilator Tank comes with a weak point that&#x27;s a video game classic. You need to find the big, glowing spot and shoot at it until the machine lies in pieces. That&#x27;s easier said than done, usually, but with the right firepower and some quick footwork you too can beat the Tank.

                              <span>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of &quot;the greatest of all time&quot; inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we&#x27;re taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we&#x27;ll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you&#x27;ll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

First up, we dive deep into our most recent cover story for No Rest for the Wicked, talk a bit about how realistic and nauseating the driving is in Pacific Drive, learn about WWE 2K24, and prepare for the impending Moomin invasion. We also mop up on some games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway before Suriel shares details about the game he has been working on, Merchants of Rosewall. And we finish out the show by answering some reader questions.

Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.

                              <span>Fortnite: Chapter 5 was a huge launch for the long-running battle royale developed by Epic Games. Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.
As Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths &amp; Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. 
Prepare thyselves, mere mortals!

Unfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there&#x27;s plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there&#x27;s a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths &amp; Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8.

                              <span>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed in a PlayStation Blog post that Season 2 of Helldivers 2 launches next week with a new &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; Warbond. This new Warbond is packed with &quot;high-voltage vibes,&quot; giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. 
Warbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new &quot;Acquisitions&quot; battle pass of things to unlock. However, don&#x27;t fret if you&#x27;re still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don&#x27;t expire. 
Check out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: 


Within this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with &quot;wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.&quot; The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the &quot;end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating &#x27;the Soldier of Tomorrow.&#x27;&quot;
In terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn&#x27;t need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. 
You can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. 

Elsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. 
Cutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14.

                              <span>Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today&#x27;s trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. 
The trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell&#x27;s Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins&#x27; Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan&#x27;s mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten&#x27;s Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: 


&quot;Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there&#x27;s almost nothing left to have,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.&quot; 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11.

Announced at Gamescom 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening hasn&#x27;t had much in the way of news since its reveal. That promising trailer gave us a basic idea of what the game, which is a small part of a multimedia franchise, is going for, but beyond the basic premise laid out by the series, we haven&#x27;t learned anything new about the game in quite some time. However, I recently had the chance to meet with publisher Bandai Namco and developer Reflector Entertainment to learn more about the game and see the first gameplay footage.

                              <span>Amid industry-wide layoffs that have already affected more than 6,700 people in 2024 alone (on top of 10,000 laid off in the games industry last year), Capcom has announced it is increasing its starting salary in Japan by more than 25 percent.

After three earlier setbacks, the movie companies are now seeking a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review of their quest to obtain the IP-addresses of Redditors who posted piracy-related comments on the platform. Reddit objects to the request, stressing its users&#x27; First Amendment right to anonymous speech should not be interfered with.

                              <span>All EU countries are free to introduce site-blocking measures to reduce piracy, but there&#x27;s little unity across the bloc. A steady pace in the Netherlands and Spain stands in contrast to the enthusiasm of Italy and Eastern Europe&#x27;s apathy.

When that will actually happen is unclear but BuffStreams seems unlikely to lose any sleep.

                              <span>11 bit studios are best known for grim games like colony sim Frostpunk, which is all about trying to survive in a world battered by relentless blizzards. But their latest venture - created in partnership with developers Chibig and Inverge Studios, and co-written by Rhianna Pratchett - is drastically different. Titled Creatures Of Ava, it&#x27;s a fantasy game about saving Pokémon-like creatures, as opposed to, well, imprisoning them and using them for labour (Palworld, I&#x27;m looking at you).

                              <span>Frogwares finally regained sole control of The Sinking City in January, after years of dispute, and have wasted no time in now revealing a sequel, with an upcoming Kickstarter campaign for a &quot;safety net&quot;, coming in 2025. The new and extremely damp survival horror game, set in a heavily flooded New England city in the 1920s, is pivoting the studio to a &quot;&#x27;horror-first&#x27; focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration and its Lovecraftian setting and story&quot;. This is a step away from the studio&#x27;s mainstay, the Sherlock Holmes detective games, and I am uncertain about the choice. But let&#x27;s peer through the weeds a bit further.

                              <span>Fans of curly wind FX and striking from a sheathed stance rejoice - open world samurai action game Ghost of Tsushima is coming to PC on May 16th via Steam and Epic Games Store. This is the Director&#x27;s Cut edition of the game, which includes the Iki Island story expansion and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. It&#x27;s being developed by PC port specialists Nixxes, the studio behind the PC version of Horizon Forbidden West - Complete Edition, and features customisable mouse and keyboard controls plus unlocked frame rates and assorted graphical whizbangs. I&#x27;ve got a trailer for you below.

                              <span>Not long ago, a few of us from the RPS Treehouse wandered through first-person survival &#x27;em up Nightingale with its boss Aaryn Flynn, and then had it out about the game&#x27;s crafting menus. I was one of the folks who wasn&#x27;t so hot on what we&#x27;d played, and I&#x27;d hoped that the early access version would prove me wrong.
Alas, I am sad to report that I still do not like Nightingale. From what I&#x27;ve played so far, the game is an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind, which makes you feel divorced from the very world you inhabit.

The patch nerfs three of what were hitherto the best Helldivers 2 guns and gear pieces - the SG-225 Breaker shotgun, the RS-422 railgun, and the SH-32 shield generator backpack, all of which break Arrowhead&#x27;s pretty straightforward golden rule that &quot;each gun has its purpose and none is strictly better than another&quot;.

                              <span>Yesterday I banged out the first in a torrid trilogy of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 features, centring on hands-on time with the game&#x27;s Mystic Spearhand &quot;vocation&quot; or class. Look out for parts 2 and 3 over the coming week. During the hands-on, I also spent 45 minutes in the shoes of another advanced Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 class, the Magic - sorry, Magick Archer. You might remember this vocation from the original Dragon&#x27;s Dogma; then as now, it combines relatively straightforward bow combat with various breeds of enchanted ammunition, for a surprisingly technical skillset that is enjoyable to faff around with.

I haven&#x27;t played an Outlast game since reviewing the second numbered game and having excitable opinions about its portrayal of the moon. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;d assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game&#x27;s mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation.

Unknown 9: Awakening - Summer 2024


First announced at Gamescom 2020, this supernatural third-person action game showed its first signs of life in over three years with its first gameplay trailer. It stars Haroona, a woman gifted with supernatural powers used to battle enemies across an Indian city. You can learn more here. 
Sleight of Hand - 2025


Created by RiffRaff games led by Framed developer Joshua Boggs, this third-person, stealth-focused noir deckbuilder is directly inspired by Metal Gear Solid. You can learn more here.

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview gave us a new look at Frostpunk 2, including a release date.  First announced in 2021, 11 Bit Studios’ tense city-management sim arrives on July 25, and it’s also coming to PC Game Pass.
A new trailer shows off some of the game’s bleak, choice-driven gameplay. You’re charged with leading a city set within an inhospitable frozen wasteland, making decisions about how it’s governed to keep mouths fed and, hopefully, happy. That includes managing labor, politics, and even the food supply, which can ingratiate you to citizens or, worst case, cause them to revolt.  


Frostpunk 2 will first launch on PC but will come to consoles at a later date (including Xbox Game Pass). You can read our review of the first Frostpunk here.</span>

                              <span>About eight months ago, Capcom and Microsoft revealed Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess in somewhat vague terms. It is an action game based in and inspired by historical Japan, but that was about all we knew. Today, Capcom showed a lot more gameplay and offered some additional insight into the single player game. Plus it detailed more of exactly what the game is on its Xbox Wire page.
The action is defined as &quot;dancing swords,&quot; but you will also be making decisions about what villagers you will take with you on your journey, leading to some strategic elements. You will apparently be making preparations for battle during the day to protect your Maiden and the village before the night, which is when battle takes place.


Capcom and Microsoft do not have a release date for the game yet, but it is apparently coming this year and will be included with Game Pass subscriptions.</span>

                              <span>Last July, Square Enix revealed that Final Fantasy XIV, the critically acclaimed and long-running MMORPG, would be coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. 
This news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. 


The timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game&#x27;s next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. 
Before Dawntrail, though, you&#x27;ll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story. Getting caught up should be a lot of fun, though, and you&#x27;ll get to find out why Final Fantasy XIV is ranked so high on Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game.

                              <span>Unknown 9: Awakening has been silent since its reveal at Gamescom 2020, but today’s Xbox Partner Preview saw it reemerge with its first gameplay trailer and release window.


The game is set within the popular sci-fi media franchise and is a third-person adventure starring Haroona (played by The Witcher&#x27;s Anya Chalotra), a woman gifted with mysterious abilities. The game&#x27;s official website has the following synopsis: 
That includes, from what we can tell, sucking people&#x27;s souls out of their bodies and telepathically blasting enemies through destructible environments. Haroona can also pull enemies, control their minds, and more. The game also features parkour-style platforming across an Indian city. 
Unknown 9: Awakening is coming this summer to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The Alters is a fascinating new sci-fi survival game from 11 Bit Studios, makers of Frostpunk and This War of Mine. First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by &quot;himself,&quot; I mean multiple versions of himself.
Jan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the &quot;what if&quot; scenarios of Jan&#x27;s life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. 


The Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today&#x27;s Xbox Partner Preview also revealed it&#x27;s coming to Game Pass for console and PC.</span>

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima is finally riding to PC. The game’s Director’s Cut is making its way to Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 16 and includes PC-specific enhancements. 
In terms of content, the Director’s Cut includes the full game, the Iki Island story expansion, and the co-op multiplayer Legends mode. Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. 


Developer Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.
Per the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” 
Ghost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. 
Ghost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.</span>

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service shooter from Batman: Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios, debuted last month to mixed reviews from both critics and fans alike. However, Rocksteady is looking to pump something new into the game with the release of Joker as a playable character. 
Teased back in January as an Elseworlds version of the popular villain, this Joker, notably not the same voiced by Mark Hamill in the Arkham games, goes live on March 28. Rocksteady revealed this release date the same day its parent company, Warner Bros., announced it is doubling down on live-service and free-to-play games.

Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, &quot;and many more.&quot; The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area.

Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products.

This means that X can still be held liable for failing to act properly against repeat copyright infringers.

                              <span>A company in Spain and seven of its workers have been fined between 540 and 673,000 euros for their role in an international IPTV piracy operation shut down by the authorities almost eight years ago. The sentences are described as &#x27;historic&#x27; since they target corporate actors rather than private individuals. However, background to the case makes this case historic for entirely different reasons.

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>

                              <span>Meta keep emailing me to tell me my Oculus account is going to be deleted on March 29th. It&#x27;s only today, seeing other people talking about it, that it occurs to me: this is not personal. Meta is perhaps going to delete your Oculus account on March 29th as well, if you have one. 

You&#x27;ve got until that date to migrate your account, and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll lose all your purchases.

                              <span>Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there&#x27;s anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. 


In Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled &quot;pawn&quot; characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.

                              <span>A little while back, Embracer Group sadly shut down Timesplitter&#x27;s studio Free Radical Design in a typical case of Embracer-led restructuring. After the closure, a former Free Radical developer revealed they&#x27;d worked on a &quot;clone&quot; of Fortnite before it transitioned to a remake of Timesplitters 2. And now footage has emerged of the cancelled project, which certainly does look like a team shooter reminiscent of Epic&#x27;s epic.

                              <span>Berserk Boy is the legally distinct lovechild of Sonic The Hedgehog and Mega Man X, on account of how it fondly emulates the Blue Blur’s speedy momentum and the Dorky Mega’s various power-altering suits. That anatomically tricky relationship is enticing by itself, but even if those retro action platformers just register as historical relics in your memory, Berserk Boy does enough that’s new and interesting that it doesn’t need to rely on aping its inspirations. My only beef is that credits rolled before I was properly given a chance to test my newfound robo-bashing muscles.

                              <span>If you dislike getting stabbed in the back in first-person games, you might not like Voin. If you like ravaged Gothic masonry and dramatic evening skies, you might like Voin. If you dislike fighting fireball-lobbing demons with a sword, you might not like Voin. If you like open-ended, changeable levels full of loot and secrets, you might like Voin. If you are confused about whether you&#x27;ll like or dislike Voin, you might want to try it for yourself during the first public Steam playtest on Friday, March 8th.

Having spent all of 30 minutes with an early playtest build, I&#x27;m cautiously impressed. I suspect there are cooler, less-known inspirations at work, but this feels like a Demon&#x27;s Souls-ified Doom Eternal that doesn&#x27;t quite have Doom Eternal&#x27;s swagger and precision, probably because it is the work of just one developer, Nikita Sozidar, rather than hundreds.

The newly released specs, which you can find below, suggest that pushing the open world, robosaur-slaying sequel to its most extreme settings will take a burly graphics card – but likewise, lower settings and resolutions can get by with much creakier hardware.

I played the prologue to the game today (which is about 40 minutes long) and discovered that you have to level up your horse before you can gallop. Sir: no.

                              <span>As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I&#x27;d expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn&#x27;t do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.


Expeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I&#x27;ve had with an imaginary car since 2018&#x27;s Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.

                              <span>I like a city builder, me, and newly revealed Beware Of Light, from tiny indie studio Bajka Games, has a interesting hook (and a Ronseal-type name, which you know I appreciate). Your advanced colony ship has veered off course, and you&#x27;ve crashed on a dead, desert planet with no water or fossil resources like oil. It&#x27;s sort of a hot Frostpunk, because you have to manage manpower, there are limited resources to distribute, and nobody is going to help. You must live. What do now?

                              <span>After several months on the Steam beta build, Valve last night officially launched an update which revamps the shopping experience and lets you hide your shame. Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won&#x27;t ask why you might want to hide any particular games.

It isn&#x27;t Temtem: Swarm, aka Temtem Vampire Survivors, nor is it Temtem 2. But it will &quot;try out new things we would love to see in a hypothetical Temtem 2&quot;, including a new combat system running on a &quot;stronger&quot; game engine. The tease accompanies news that Crema are making significant changes to Temtem as part of the game&#x27;s update 1.7 - for one thing, they&#x27;re getting rid of the whole microtransaction system. Temtempestuous times indeed!

I visited Capcom last month to play the game for about three hours, and you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 preview impressions here, but I also spoke to director Hideaki Itsuno about how the game will run on consoles. 
Sitting in Capcom&#x27;s San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s framerate. Specifically, he revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate. It was an interesting announcement, considering &quot;uncapped framerate&quot; is typically something I associate with PCs – not the PlayS…</span>

No Rest for the Wicked (NRftW) graces Game Informer&#x27;s cover this month, and it marks a dramatic shift for Moon Studios for several reasons. For one, it&#x27;s an action RPG from the team that gave us two of the best platformers/Metroidvanias ever in Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. You can read all about what the game entails in our digital issue, which is available now. But another huge shift is that NRftW will first launch into Steam Early Access on April 18.

                              <span>In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn&#x27;t had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.
Warning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.

The 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.
Players take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>In 1987, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird developed a storyline for their creation that never came to fruition. Titled &quot;The Last Ronin,&quot; Eastman and Laird envisioned it as the final Turtles story set 30 years in the future. While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise&#x27;s new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.
The story is bleak and gritty, establishing a universe where the four beloved brothers have been taken out one by one. It&#x27;s set in an alterna…</span>

                              <span>Amazon Studios&#x27; TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. 
That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.


As you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you&#x27;d like. 
It&#x27;s a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. 
For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon&#x27;s Fallout TV series. After that, check out the first Fallout TV series trailer.

                              <span>Hades, the critically acclaimed roguelite from developer Supergiant Games, is coming to Netflix later this month. It will be available to all subscribers on iOS devices starting March 19, but you can pre-register right now.
While Netflix might sound like an odd fit for a game that&#x27;s available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, Netflix says this mobile version of Hades features 60 FPS gameplay, redesigned menus and interfaces, fully customizable on-screen controls, cloud saves, achievements, and offline play. 
Check out a new trailer for Hades on Netflix for yourself below: 


We really enjoyed Hades here at Game Informer, giving it an 8.5 out of 10 in our review for being &quot;a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships,&quot; amongst other things like its high-octane action gameplay. 
Hades coming to Netflix might be the perfect excuse to replay the game ahead of the Early Access debut of its sequel, Hades II, which is set to begin this year. 
Hades joins a growing list of great games available now or soon on Netflix, like Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, Katana Zero, Death&#x27;s Door, and Braid: Anniversary Edition.

                              <span>Moomin, the popular Finish comic character from the 1940s, is getting a video game in 2024 – and we&#x27;re ready for it. You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he&#x27;s never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy&#x27;s team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.
I had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.
Check out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.

                              <span>Developer Little Knight Games has revealed Mira and the Legend of the Djinns, an upcoming 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania inspired by Moroccan mythology. Set to be published by Assemble Entertainment, which is publishing Endzone 2 this spring, Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is due out on PC via Steam this year. 
In classic Metroidvania fashion, you can expect plenty of enemies and secrets to discover with a variety of tools, items, and abilities as you progress through the game. Plus, unlockable moves add flair to your exploration and combat encounters as you attempt to uncover the secret of the last Djinn. 
Check out Mira and the Legend of the Djinns for yourself below:
 

&quot;Not every ancient treasure belongs in a museum, as treasure hunter Yuba discovers within the debris of the kingdom of Fallen Amazgesh,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;There, Yuba meets a Djinn named Mira, a race long lost to the world of man, and the pair team up together to escape the ruins and discover Mira&#x27;s lost memories.&quot;
Little Knight Games says the game&#x27;s combat &quot;emphasizes fluidity and experimentation, and allows you to switch between weapons and elemental modes on the fly.&quot; The Germany-based studio says it&#x27;s a team of seven people from different countries around the world and that Mira and the Legend of the Djinns is a love letter to Metroidvanias, &quot;featuring a world based on the Moroccan and Amazigh mythology.&quot; 

&quot;Morocco has a rich culture filled with fantasy stories about Djinns and mysterious creatures,&quot; the press release reads. &quot;With the team&#x27;s diverse background, they wanted to show this in their very first game.&quot; 
Other Mira and the Legend of the Djinns features include a sprawling map full of secrets, fast action combat, and a mystery to keep you pushing forward.

Nintendo named an unknown company as the sole defendant, while focusing on the actions of Yuzu&#x27;s lead developer, who wasn&#x27;t named as a defendant, or even named at all. A joint motion for a $2.4m judgment in favor of Nintendo was filed on Monday. The cost to the emulation scene appear in a proposed injunction.

                              <span>Several prominent textbook publishers including Cengage, Macmillan Learning , and Pearson Education, are seeking $30 million in piracy damages from the operators of shadow library, LibGen. Collecting payment from the unknown defendants will be complicated, but the terms of a proposed injunction reveal that the publishers aim to target the site&#x27;s domain names and proxy services, even third-party IPFS gateways.

Foreign companies face significant obstacles when attempting to enforce their rights in China but here, anti-piracy group CODA, acting for major Japanese anime rightsholders, came up with a novel strategy. The convictions of a pirate site operator and two uploaders are the first ever obtained by foreign rightsholders inside China.

I was thinking about this as I watched the new trailer for Synduality: Echo of Ada, a mech extraction shooter I would probably gladly play instead of going out - but is nevertheless very exhausting to watch itself, at least in this glimpse. You and I will be able to give its open beta a go while avoiding any social engagements later this month.

                              <span>When we first meet The Thaumaturge&#x27;s hero Wiktor Szulski, we&#x27;re told he&#x27;s a man cursed by the vice of pride. It&#x27;s a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such &#x27;Flaws&#x27; can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It&#x27;s these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.
He&#x27;s a man that&#x27;s ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge&#x27;s 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we&#x27;re repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw&#x27;s political hotbed.

The new season will be a prelude to roguelite spin-off Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, it&#x27;ll have a new mission type, enemies, new overclocks, and the devs are looking into letting players activate past seasons.

In the middle of the white space there is a curious little yellow machine, a kind of motorised plunger akin to an oil derrick. In the story of Sixty Four, you&#x27;re late to some kind of social engagement, somewhere beyond that beaming expanse of whiteness. But there is time, even as texts from a friend appear down the lefthand margin, to mess around with the strange yellow machine.

Over the weekend, developers Prophecy Games announced March 12th is the date, with the full launch to follow after up to a year. Prophecy are spun off from Hi-Rez Studios, the folks who who made Tribes: Ascend, which officially shut down a few years back. I hear this next one&#x27;s pretty fun.

This weekend saw the release of the Crystal Creations Stuff Pack, a DLC for The Sims 4 that takes the ability to find crystals (already in the game) and straps on your Sims making them into semi-precious, semi-magic jewellery that can be charged up by the moon. What I find more interesting is that this launched with some official IRL Sims plumbob jewellery that you can buy and wear around your own precious, swan-like neck.

                              <span>Eco is a very ambitious, wildly reactive multiplayer survival game in which you try to save the world without accidentally destroying it. There&#x27;s a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. 


Players must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don&#x27;t flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.

Where some see an overpriced, memory-deprived albatross of a graphics card, I’ve only ever seen a fast and feature-rich GPU whose 12GB of VRAM is demonstrably fine for 99.95% of games at 4K. A better deal than the RTX 4080 for that resolution, in any case.
Now, though, we can all agree: nobody should buy an RTX 4070 Ti. Not when the RTX 4070 Ti Super is here, doing a better, hopefully less contentious job of smooth 4K without demanding RTX 4080 (or, indeed, RTX 4080 Super) levels of investment.

                              <span>Last week&#x27;s alleged Epic Games hack was a scam, so-called &quot;ransomware&quot; group Mogilevich have confessed, or at least, are reported to have confessed in a self-congratulary new statement. The group have not, it now seems, stolen a bunch of login data, WIP software and payment information from the creators of Fortnite; they were only pretending to have done so with a view to duping other hackers into buying their tools. 


Or at least, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re said to be saying now. I haven&#x27;t tracked down the original source for Mogilevich&#x27;s latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described &quot;professional fraudster&quot; should probably be treated with caution. Still, it lines up with Epic&#x27;s own comments last week that there was no real sign that a hack had taken place.

It&#x27;s another relatively quiet week for big name PC releases - no mega-sequels or adaptations, unless you&#x27;re seriously into the Moomins - but if 2024 has taught me anything it&#x27;s that a breakout hit can come from anywhere, and I will accordingly be watching this week&#x27;s new games with deep suspicion and barely constrained panic.

                              <span>An Xbox Partner Preview event has been announced for Wednesday, March 6. The presentation will highlight a number of new titles while providing updates on previously announced third-party games heading to Xbox.
An Xbox Wire post states that to expect titles from publishers such as Capcom, EA, and Nexon. On top of revealing new titles and over a dozen trailers, we’ll learn more about the mechanics of Tales of Kenzera: Zau. The event will reveal new gameplay footage of Capcom’s mysterious action game Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which was first announced last summer. We&#x27;ll also learn more details of The First Berserker: Khazan, the single-player action RPG set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter (DNF) universe. Microsoft says this will be a “no frills” showcase, meaning it will consist of nothing but new trailers, new games, behind-the-scenes looks, and release date announcements. 
The event will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on various Xbox channels such as YouTube and Twitch. It will run for 30 minutes.

                              <span>A new trailer for Greedfall 2: The Dying World reveals that the game is launching into Early Access via Steam sometime this summer. The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.
Premiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game&#x27;s setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. 


Spiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: 


Once its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of the first Greedfall here.</span>

With some unbelievable heat surrounding the Dune franchise following last weekend&#x27;s release of the critically acclaimed Dune: Part Two, Conan Exiles developer Funcom provided a huge update for its anticipated MMO, Dune: Awakening, during a livestreamed Dune Direct today. Last week, Funcom and Warner Bros. invited me to the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California for an advance Dune Direct and Dune: Part Two screening. While I entered this event lukewarm on the Dune franchise, I emerged enamored with the film and excited about the promises being made by the game.

                              <span>Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.
Cataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.


The game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. 
Cataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.</span>

                              <span>Space Crew is superficially similar to FTL: you manage a crew in space as you deal with peril, put out fires and fight off aliens. It&#x27;s set apart by between-mission management, during which you get the steady dopamine drip of ship, crew and equipment upgrades and customisation.

It&#x27;s free to keep from Steam for the next two weeks.

                              <span>The two Ori games were gorgeous platformers that challenged your dexterity while tugging on your heartstrings. The next game from developers Moon Studios seems more likely to do the former than the latter. No Rest For The Wicked is a Souls-ish action RPG that apparently thinks you&#x27;re extremely wicked. 

It also got a release date today during a showcase stream: April 18th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s looking increasingly likely that Gearbox Entertainment is going to be sold by Embracer. In a town hall with staff earlier this week, CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford reportedly told staff that a decision had been made regarding the studio&#x27;s future, with more details to be shared in March.

Embracer bought Gearbox for $1.3 billion (around £1.02 billion) in 2021, but it was reported that they were looking to sell last year as part of ongoing layoffs, closures and divestments.

                              <span>I come to you with an important question today, readers. Has there ever been an actually good sewer level in a video game before? I propose to you that there has not. Sewer levels are the worst. They have always been the worst, and will always be the worst. There is no redeeming feature that can make sewer levels good, fun or enjoyable, and I come to you today saying they must stop. No more sewer levels, developers. Please. I beg you. Especially you, Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster. You&#x27;re the chief offender in this whole mess, and both my nostrils and my sanity simply cannot take it anymore.

                              <span>When Ori And The Blind Forest developers Moon Studios announced that their next game would be a top-down, online action RPG, my initial reaction was, &#x27;Heck yes, sign me the hell up for this Souls-y, Diablo-y hack and slash.&#x27; Having now played the opening 90 minutes of the game ahead of tonight&#x27;s Wicked Inside showcase, that initial excitement has settled into more of a &#x27;Hoo boy, this thing is hard as nails. Folks who like Elden Ring and Dark Souls are going to go absolutely bananas for it.&#x27; It&#x27;s definitely verging on the edge of being just a teensy bit too punishing for my personal taste, but even though my arse got thoroughly whomped time and time again during this initial prologue section, there&#x27;s still something about No Rest For The Wicked that&#x27;s left me quietly captivated.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a tale as old as time: when a great, popular game rises to the top of the Steam charts, scammers and chancers will do everything in their power to steal some of that glory for themselves. The latest victim is Helldivers 2, with scammers putting up two separate fake pages for it on Steam over the last 24 hours. Each page listed Arrowhead as the developer, and PlayStation as the publisher, along with big discounts of 50-75% off to tempt players into buying the cheap version instead of the real one.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not surprised that I&#x27;m playing so much Balatro, because the deck-building poker game is fantastic and it seems just about everyone is playing it. What surprises me is that I&#x27;m playing in a way I rarely play roguelikelike games: launching enthusiastically into Endless mode. Turns out, what I want from Endless modes is an end. A brutal and hilariously sudden end.

Put down the cards and pick up a boltgun, then, as this month’s Game Club pledges eternal service (until April) to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.

The latest delightfully weird device rising to the eternal question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; is a WiFi-enabled &#x27;smart toothbrush&#x27;, which is juuust powerful enough to run a version of Doom. You can even control it with your mouse. Here, check this out.

                              <span>There are moments where Sons Of The Forest matches the sublime paranoia of Subnautica. There’s that same lurching, exquisite tension as you delve deeper and deeper into darkness where you are not welcome, supplies dwindling, footfall echoing, monstrosities skittering about in the black. On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.
It’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one. Consider this your cue to peel open some skin pouches.

                              <span>As the video games industry violently contracts to ensure shareholder satisfaction at the cost of making thousands upon thousands of people unemployed, Skylanders studio Toys For Bob have announced they&#x27;re splitting from Activision Blizzard and Microsoft to go independent. Good for them, but maybe too late for some. Earlier this month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that it seemed Activision Blizzard were closing Toys For Bob&#x27;s California headquarters and laying off 86 people. Still, the new independent Toys For Bob say they&#x27;re working on something new and &quot;exploring a possible partnership&quot; with Microsoft.

                              <span>Moon Studios, makers of the acclaimed Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, is tackling a dramatically different project in its first action RPG, No Rest for the Wicked. First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.
No Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.
Although No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.</span>

                              <span>While the easy layup might have been a third game in the amazing Ori series, developer Moon Studios&#x27; next game after 2020&#x27;s Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an isometric action-RPG called No Rest For The Wicked. It&#x27;s the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game&#x27;s opening hour or so. 
In it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game&#x27;s first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon&#x27;s pivot to this new genre.

Last month, I traveled to Vienna, Austria, with Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to visit Ori series developer Moon Studios. It was here that Marcus spoke to Mahler and his fellow Moon co-founder and technical director Gennadiy Korol about No Rest For The Wicked, the action RPG adorning Issue 365 of Game Informer magazine, as you might have just learned if you watched Wicked Inside today. 
I watched Marcus play the game for a couple of hours, and while I was there to film for cover story purposes, I&#x27;d be lying if I said I didn’t watch with som…</span>

                              <span>Moon Studios cemented itself as a premier upstart studio thanks to its stellar work on Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The team is parlaying that success and experience to craft a dramatically different project it&#x27;s been dreaming about for years: No Rest for the Wicked. This dark fantasy action RPG combines influences from a variety of genres, from ARPGs like Diablo to the difficulty and thoughtful combat of Dark Souls, to the town-building of Animal Crossing, and more.
We traveled to Vienna, Austria, to visit the home (and Moon&#x27;s de facto headquarters) of co-founder Thomas Mahler. Joined by Moon&#x27;s other co-founder and CEO, Gennadiy Korol, we went hands-on with No Rest for the Wicked and filled 12 pages with our impressions and exclusive details about the game&#x27;s…</span>

The site&#x27;s staff doesn&#x27;t explain the latest brand switch but a recent &#x27;dynamic+&#x27; site blocking order in India may have factored into their decision.

Contrary to some reports, today&#x27;s changes don&#x27;t amount to a total ban on VPNs. Use of state approved VPNs, which do everything except the useful stuff, remain legal. The new law criminalizes the promotion of VPNs for site-blocking circumvention. But Russia also wants citizen&#x27;s to stay safe, warning that VPNs in the U.S. are prone to government spying.

The latest data show that automated copyright claims remain in favor and are rising rapidly. In the first half of 2023, YouTube processed 980 million Content ID claims, a 25% increase compared to a year earlier. By claiming videos this way, rightsholders generate billions in additional revenue.

                              <span>The Trustworthy Accountability Group aims to increase trust in the digital advertising industry, in part by limiting pirate sites&#x27; access to advertising. A new initiative will see the development of a new blocklist containing pirate site domains to be avoided. The idea isn&#x27;t new but here, pirate site data will be combined with data originally obtained by anti-malware vendors, meaning that pirate sites with malicious ads could make themselves even more of a target.

This mechanical keyboard is more humble than its peers too, with a $30 asking price that is absolutely exceptional for a name-brand keyboard that gets rave reviews: the Keychron C3 Pro.

                              <span>You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren&#x27;t likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they&#x27;re still well worth covering. 
The subject of today&#x27;s deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024.

This is the Kolink Rocket Complex, a whimsically-named case with a beautiful metal design and a tower-style (rocket-like?) taller-than-wide form factor. It originally retailed for £155, but now you can get it from Overclockers UK for just £70.

That&#x27;s a shame, but I have still have two to four articles to share with you, and I&#x27;m going to start with this ultrawide monitor from Lenovo, the Legion R45W-30. This is a huge 45-incher, offering what is essentially two 1440p 165Hz screens side-by-side. It normally retails for £799, but today Very are offering it for £100 off - £699. That&#x27;s a good price for what is essentially two mid-range gaming monitors seamlessly joined into one.

                              <span>Given its zero-tolerance approach to piracy, Nintendo&#x27;s copyright lawsuit targeting the company behind Switch emulator &#x27;Yuzu&#x27; isn&#x27;t a big surprise. While the 41-page complaint throws almost everything at the hugely popular Switch emulation project, Nintendo&#x27;s focus on specific functionality plus knowledge, conduct, and intent, seems to avoid a direct assault on general emulation. It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

                              <span>Today we released our first candidate for version 14! That means we will start to focus on fixing the remaining bugs and stop adding new features. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we have already solved many of the issues. But there might still be a few issues lurking around in this release candidate. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. Thanks to our translators, about half of the translations are (nearly) up-to-date. For the other half, we might need your help with translating. If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>How do you update a 30-year old pixel font to make it more suitable for today? The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.</span>
