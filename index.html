In Like a Dragon is was a confectionary store. In Yakuza 6 it was a baseball team. In one of the series’ two upcoming games, though, it’s going to be something more…

                              <span>The Pokémon mods are rolling in
Despite some glaring technical issues, the newest mainline games in the Pokémon series, Scarlet &amp; Violet, have been smash hits. It&#x27;s likely that Game Freak will do their best to patch the most glaring of glitches out as soon as they can, but that doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the game&#x27;s abysmal performance slow-downs will necessarily be fixed. Thankfully, fans are stepping in with mods to make for a smoother Pokémon experience, even though Nintendo is particularly tough on those who modify their games. There are some brave soldiers out there doing Arceus&#x27; work to help give us a better gaming experience even at the risk of being struck down by the powers that be, and we have to commend them for that.
The modder in question is called &quot;theboy181,&quot; and they&#x27;re creating a mod that allows players to take on the games at a silky smooth 60fps, which is a welcome change for those who have already given Scarlet &amp; Violet a whirl. While the mod is not yet publicly available, and we don&#x27;t have any information on when to expect the mod&#x27;s release, theboy181 has posted some proof-of-concept photos to Twitter, and it looks absolutely amazing.
https://twitter.com/theboy181/status/1596759874654048263
If you want to give the mod a spin when it eventually comes out, you&#x27;ll likely have to play it on a PC emulator rather than a Nintendo Switch, as that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s being developed in the first place. It&#x27;s not impossible that theboy181, or another modder, could make it playable on a jailbroken console, and if you&#x27;re already looking to mod a Nintendo title, I&#x27;d bet you&#x27;re cool with hacking a Switch anyway.
I find it pretty amazing that players have figured out how to modify games so seamlessly, and while I would have preferred Nintendo release a polished, bug-free title in the first place, knowing that the modding community has our backs makes me feel a bit better about things.

                              <span>Another look at the new Mario movie
We&#x27;re getting another look at The Super Mario Bros. Movie, and soon. Nintendo is hosting a world premiere for The Super Mario Bros. Movie second trailer tomorrow, November 29.
The Direct, as Nintendo is dubbing it, will air live at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. There&#x27;s no estimation on how long this one will be, though given its prior Direct, this movie teaser will likely be on the shorter side.
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1597350002028064768/
As Nintendo states in its tweet, no game information will be included in this Nintendo Direct. Much like the first Super Mario Bros. Movie Direct, this one will seemingly focus on just the film. And also, hopefully, more selfie cam talking heads with the cast.
Mario goes to the movies
In our first trailer for the new Mario movie in September, we got a pretty good look and feel for what&#x27;s in store. It seems like a Mario isekai, with the plumber waking up in the Mushroom Kingdom and setting off for adventure.
Meanwhile, Jack Black&#x27;s Bowser absolutely stole the show. Both his pre-trailer guest spot and his in-trailer performance as the King of the Koopas was excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yPpazvJrHm0
There are still some principal performances we&#x27;re waiting on, though. No sign of Peach or Donkey Kong yet, and we got maybe a smidgeon of Charlie Day&#x27;s Luigi at the end there.
Considering the teaser image for the new Direct features the stained-glass art of Peach&#x27;s castle, we&#x27;ll hopefully get more of the cast this time around.
The stream goes live at 2 p.m. PT over here on Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube. Nintendo and Illumination&#x27;s film is set to debut on April 7, 2023.

You play as a young elephant with juvenile diabetes who must both scroll sides and eat a balanced diet. I don’t remember the last time a game asked me to eat a balanced diet. Surely, Yume Penguin Monogatari pulled a fast one by having me completely avoid food, but normally I’m just packing away every floating pretzel like I’ve just accepted the failure of my New Year&#x27;s resolution.
Going in, I admittedly didn’t know a whole lot about diabetes. I’ve known people whose lives have been affected by it, but never close enough that I…</span>

One of the better mini-games from the Yakuza series is making its return. Upcoming Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will have a cabaret mini-game.
The Like a Dragon, née Yakuza, series has had a wealth of minigames over the years. But few are as well-remembered as the cabaret ones. First making an appearance in Yakuza 0 and then again in Kiwami 2, these sections have you manage a club of hostesses.
Unlocking new hostesses through quests and scouting, while also competing with other clubs, became quite an engrossing side activity. And now it looks like the festivities return for Like a Dragon Gaiden.
https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1597301578675130368
Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name follows longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, after the events of Yakuza 6. The Dragon of Dojima stepped down from the spotlight in the sixth entry as Ichiban Kasuga took over in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. (Kiryu did make an appearance in that entry, but didn&#x27;t star.)
Gaiden looks to bridge the gap a bit, as Like a Dragon 8 will have both Ichiban and Kiryu in the lead. And from the looks of it, Kiryu has been going through some stuff.

A year of dragons
It looks like we&#x27;ve got a decent amount of RGG content on its way, as the studio is also due to release Like a Dragon: Ishin next February. With Gaiden also set for 2023 and Like a Dragon 8 aiming for 2024, there&#x27;s a lot of Kiryu in store for the next year or so.
All that said, I&#x27;m happy to see the cabaret game returning. It&#x27;s fondly remembered for a reason, and will hopefully add an extra bit of mini-game oomph to Gaiden. As much as I liked holding meetings in Like a Dragon, I&#x27;m ready to manage the club again.

                              <span>Comic book carnage from Firaxis
Publisher 2K Games and developer Firaxis have released a gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming release, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns. The comic-book strategy adventure will launch next week on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series, with PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch ports to follow at a later date.
In the video, we see the turn-based strategy that Firaxis has finally honed in games such as the acclaimed XCOM series applied to familiar characters from Marvel&#x27;s huge universe of superheroes, (and villains). Under the guidance of custom protagonist &quot;The Hunter&quot;, players will utilize the skills of names such as Dr. Stange, Wolverine, Iron Man, Blade, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and The Scarlet Witch to lead an attack on the dark armies of Lillith, Mother of Demons.

Much like its XCOM brethren, Midnight Suns will offer up a story-based campaign, in which they will lead a growing team of heroes into the battlefield, utilizing the offensive and defensive capabilities of the crew to ensure a glowing victory in battle. New heroes and abilities will be forged and unlocked as the story progresses, with powerful, scene-clearing Hero Moves being offered to characters who are on a particular roll in the ongoing war against evil.
There&#x27;s no denying that the XCOM titles handle strategic action very well, and this marriage of Firaxis&#x27; pedigree with the Marvel universe&#x27;s cast of exciting characters could result in a fine hour-eater for those long, cold winter evenings. Having already faced a one-year delay, comic book fans need only wait one more week before they get the opportunity to take their favorite characters into battle.
Not my favorites, of course. As I don&#x27;t see Jessica Drew or Nebula anywhere...
Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X December 2.

                              <span>Peeling the Layers
Onion Games&#x27; game director Yoshiro Kimura has revealed that the indie studio&#x27;s next release will launch at some point in 2023. The tidbit was dropped in an interview rolled out this past weekend to subscribers of &quot;The Secret Onion Cellar&quot; newsletter.
Little has been revealed about the new release since its initial announcement back in 2020. We do know that the mysterious release is a sandbox RPG that will no doubt feature the stylized visuals and thought-provoking narratives synonymous with Onion Games hits such as 1997&#x27;s Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and 2018&#x27;s mournful shmup Black Bird. Also, according to Kimura, &quot;children&quot; will form the central theme of the new adventure.

In an additional letter to the fans, as printed by Gematsu. Kimura candidly speaks of the stress and turbulence of being an indie studio, detailing some of the psychological and physical pressures of working under budget and within limitations, while being completely unsure as to whether your release will ultimately hit it big on release. Kimura notes that it is also a very expensive process, that can take its toll on the expenses you have aside for basic living and other day-to-day costs.
&quot;Indie game developers are basically bizarre creatures that are constantly running, laughing, and playing chess, all while bleeding profusely,&quot; concludes Kimura, in a typically colorful and visceral statement, before signing off delightfully as &quot;Your Indie Game Making Uncle&quot;.
Black Bird is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and is well worth your time.

                              <span>Pocky &amp; Socky
If you&#x27;re waiting on tenterhooks for Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6, then never fear, as the veteran developer has you covered with this baffling adaptation of the genre-defining Street Fighter II, now layered thickly with the chocolate-coated biscuit snack treats known the world over as &quot;Pocky&quot;.
Yes, in a new promotional event, Capcom and Pocky distributor Ezaki Glico have created a variant of the 1991 arcade classic, freshly populated with those snack treats your anime-loving friend eats by the truckload. Specially decorated &quot;Pocky K.O.&quot; boxes will be distributed throughout Japan from tomorrow, November 29, with images of the original World Warriors emblazoned on the packaging. Inside, a special code will afford access to Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition, which can be played on mobile platforms and web browsers.

What this boils down to is a typically regular edition of the grandfather of fighting games, imbued with extra Pocky advertising. For example, characters will hold Pocky sticks/boxes in their hands during victory poses. As a weird touch, players can achieve a special &quot;Pocky K.O.&quot; when the health bar hits the correct chocolate-to-biscuit ratio on an average Pocky stick. Baffling. They could have at least applied Rainbow Edition physics.
Pocky? Partial Credit!
Of course, I&#x27;m not really angry about it. It&#x27;s darn tragic, mind, but it&#x27;s harmless fun. It&#x27;s not even the first time that Pocky and Street Fighter have collaborated. Who remembers Street Fighter V&#x27;s relatively pointless &quot;Pocky K.O. Challenge&quot; — a tournament that featured the same &quot;sweet spot&quot; qualifications for landing that elusive Pocky K.O.? Glico has also noted that it plans to build a Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition cabinet to take to trade events. A frightening prospect. The last thing yer boy Moyse needs is an excuse to eat even more chocolate whilst gaming.

We&#x27;ve read all about Street Fighter 6, we know the roster for Street Fighter 6, and some of us have even played Street Fighter 6, but where is Street Fighter 6? Hopefully, the answer to this question is nearing revelation, as the Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea has now issued an official rating for the fighting sequel, suggesting that the title is getting ready to rock.
As spotted by VGC, The Korean game rating committee, fast becoming the best spoiler for game reveals and announcements going, issued a &quot;Yellow&quot; rating for Capcom&#x27;s great-looking scrapper, which recommends it for players aged 15 or over. While this rating hardly suggests that we&#x27;ll be stepping into Metro City by the holidays, we can at least expect a release date to be forthcoming — p…</span>

Cult-classic film Starship Troopers is getting a new video game adaptation that puts your boots on the ground and closer to the action. Starship Troopers: Extermination is a new squad-based co-op FPS, aiming for Early Access on PC in 2023.
Extermination is in the works at Offworld Industries, the developer behind other shooters like Squad and Beyond the Wire. With Starship Troopers: Extermination, the studio is turning the classic sci-fi movie into a 12-player co-op shooter. It&#x27;s got bases, resources, and a whole lotta bugs.
Players pick from three different classes (Assault, Support, Defense) to cater towards their playstyle. With a base on the ground, the Troopers will need to fight against waves of Arachnids. Completing objectives, acquiring resources, building …</span>

                              <span>You secure that shit, Hudson
Rumors continue to circle Suda51&#x27;s Grasshopper Manufacture in regards to work on one, (or several), as-yet-unannounced horror titles — The latest tidbit floating through the airwaves was that the No More Heroes developer might be working on a new AAA title set within the Alien franchise.
However, this admittedly bizarre meeting of studio and franchise is seemingly untrue, or at least that&#x27;s the story from Goichi Suda himself. The esoteric game director responded to a tweet about the rumor with little more than a series of question marks — suggesting that if Grasshopper Manufacture were stepping into the iconic world of H.R. Giger&#x27;s extraterrestrial beings, then it was news to him.
https://twitter.com/suda_51/status/1596118774901805056?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;CVRjWqcGKVLdtSteYdGYbA
Of course, the internet being the internet, this has not stopped die-hard fans from thinking that perhaps Suda is merely keeping the project under wraps, and that his tweet is a smoke screen to keep people guessing. Quite honestly, Grasshopper Manufacture seems a baffling choice of developer for 20th Century Fox to contact with an eye to adapting the famous film franchise, one would assume that it would choose a studio with a less stylistic and bespoke approach to game design.
Either way, you can&#x27;t blame the fans for being excited. Despite being almost custom designed for gaming, the Alien franchise has had a seriously hit-and-miss relationship with the medium over the decades — with perhaps its best offering being 2014&#x27;s Alien Isolation. It would be pretty fascinating to see what Suda and his crew could make of the franchise&#x27;s frightening and violent xenomorphic universe, but it seems that this particular rumor can be laid to rest.

                              <span>Stay close
After drudging through internet forum rumors and all sorts of wacky tips that didn&#x27;t pan out: I finally found the answer to whether or not Pokemon Scarlet and Violet co-op can provide access to exclusives. Well, through experience, I&#x27;m here to tell you that it can!
Just know there is a caveat.

To be clear, you can catch exclusive Pokemon in co-op from either game that the co-op session has access to, but everything is proximity-based. Spawns will happen for either version (regardless of the host) so long as players are close to each other. Meaning, you can&#x27;t just go off into another part of the game world and expect to farm all of the exclusives in minutes.
As you can see in the above image, I captured Gulpin (a Violet exclusive) in south province area three while in my wife&#x27;s Violet game, as a Scarlet player (you can also view the proximity in which we were able to get this Gulpin to spawn in the header image). It&#x27;s also important to note that if your partner is really early in the story, they may not have access to mount-based movement that can get them to some of the later/endgame zones: or may not even have access to some locations entirely. So you are at the mercy of either player&#x27;s progression that regard.
With all that in mind, you can use this trick to your advantage to track down Pokemon as a unit in a really cool, organic way. The other player can potentially look up Pokemon locations on their Pokedex, then you can ride out together and look for them, and capture them together.
I spent part of the weekend doing just that, and it was a blast!

Sonic Team has released that first major patch for its recent release Sonic Frontiers — Rolling out on PlayStation now, Version 110 addresses numerous issues with the so-so adventure. Similar patches for other console and PC platforms are set to follow in the near future.
The patch notes are, oddly, only available via the Japanese Sonic Frontiers Twitter. But, thanks to a translation by UpdateCrazy, we know that Version 110 includes fixes for a variety of in-game problems, including UI and map optimization, fixes to audio issues, performance improvements, and fixes for numerous fatal crashes. The new update also cleans out a bug that would cause the Chronos Island boss to randomly disappear upon retry.

Sonic Frontiers launched on November 8 to a mish-mash of reviews and divisive fan praise. While some found the new adventure an interesting and unique new take on the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, others were ostracized by repetitive gameplay and a dull, somewhat miserable environment. Much of the fanbase sees Sonic Frontiers as a positive step for the dice-roll franchise, however, and hopes that it represents a new dawn for a series that has had its fair share of terrible releases.
There is still work to be done to bring Sonic Frontiers fully up to speed, (pun fully intended), and Sonic Team lead Morio Kishimoto has raised a few eyebrows with his comments that he sees the game&#x27;s grand worldwide launch akin to a &quot;global playtest&quot;. Despite this, Kishimoto points to the new title as a landmark moment, reinventing the long-running franchise for a brighter future.
Sonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Another batch of recognizable beans are headed to the wild and madcap world of Mediatonic&#x27;s battle royale release, Fall Guys — Following on from recent crossovers such as Doctor Who and Hatsune Miku, this new event sees the arrival of three legendary World Warriors of Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter franchise.
Three skins have been (bean?) made available to purchase in the Fall Guys in-game store, representing the stoic martial arts expert Ryu, his shadowy and demonic rival Akuma, and the British special forces agent Cammy — who has certainly been getting around in recent years. Yes, she&#x27;s wearing pants again. Chill. Additionally, new nameplates replicating the classic Street Fighter II aesthetic are also available, as well as some fun &quot;Hadoken&quot; and &quot;Shoryuken&quot; emotes. ACKSHUALLY CAMMY DUSNT DO A HADOOKEN ACKSHUALLY.
If you fancy taking these famous scrappers for a spin in the Blunderdome, then move fast, as they will be removed from sale on November 30. While we can promise that you&#x27;ll see your chosen fave playing fast and loose alongside their fellow beans, I&#x27;m afraid that performing Akuma&#x27;s Wrath of the Raging Demon is, unfortunately, out of the question. Sorry, tryhards.
Fall Guys is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

As we&#x27;ve been tackling Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s Starfall Street quest, in which you&#x27;ll have to battle a bunch of bases run by Team Star on the request of the mysterious Cassiopeia, we can&#x27;t help but wonder... why are these names so odd? The Team Star gangs are named things like &quot;Segin&quot; and &quot;Schedar&quot;, and we were left feeling like it was either something in Spanish, some kind of anagram, or some reference we were just not smart enough to get.

The sequel to Freebird Games&#x27; superlative To The Moon, Finding Paradise is a game we weren&#x27;t sure we really wanted or even needed when it first released back in 2017. How on earth could anything be expected to live up to the power and emotion of Kao Gan&#x27;s wonderful 2011 adventure? Surely any attempt to return to this world and its characters would inevitably lead to disappointment.
Well, we were flat-out wrong, thankfully. While this follow-up doesn&#x27;t quite hit the same highs, and certainly can&#x27;t match its predecessor for tear-jerking moments, it turns out to be a very worthy return to this universe indeed, a game everyone should make a little time to check out, and an absolute treat for those of us who so loved everything about the very first outing for Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts.

There are a lot of unfortunate oversights which have been unearthed in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s first weeks out in the wild. Though many of these have had us chuckling away or otherwise afraid to turn the light off at night (spaghetti trainer haunts our dreams), none of them have the potential to be quite as annoying as this theory about the games&#x27; random number generator (RNG) when in Battle Stadium mode (thanks, Eurogamer).
Originally shared on Reddit by u/Lord-Trolldemort, the player found that using the move Frost Breath (an attack with 90% accuracy) wouldn&#x27;t hit if it was the first accuracy check of the battle. This could be a coincidence, sure, but the Redditor tried out the hypothesis 14 times and had the same result on each attempt. Miss after miss. For the quick math, the chances of that happening with a working RNG is one in 100 trillion.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Kate&#x27;s not impressed by what she&#x27;s seen of Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life so far...

My very first Harvest Moon game was A Wonderful Life on the GameCube, which is lucky, because it&#x27;s one of the best. I&#x27;m not just saying that because I&#x27;m basically a nerd donut filled with delicious nostalgia jam, but because it was a really weird game. It had characters that died. It had a full lifecycle in which you could live 30 years and then pass your farm onto your kid. There&#x27;s a talking plant, and a yeti, and a mysterious homeless man who sometimes steals from your farm unless you train your dog to chase him away.

Yes, we&#x27;re back talking about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s performance, again. Look, if the game had shipped in a better state, then we wouldn&#x27;t have to, but for now, let&#x27;s just crack on.
It turns out that, yes, you can actually improve the games&#x27; performance yourself. Granted, the actual end result will likely not be noticable to the naked eye for most users, and many of you may already be implementing this particular solution, but it&#x27;s worth a cursory mention regardless.

These Pokémon Scarlet and Violet glitches have really been something, right? At their best: hilarious, at their worst: game-breaking. But the one reaction that these bugs haven&#x27;t tapped into is making us go &#x27;awww&#x27;. That is, until now.
Indeed, it seems that some players have discovered a way to share the love with the Pokémon in their team. We are always quick to congratulate our &#x27;mon after a battle with a berry, a stroke, a picnic, but what about when the trainer needs some comfort in return? Fortunately, it looks like you can get a hug from some of the wild creatures out there.

                              <span>Bewitching.
At this point, it’s easy to think that the Metroidvania genre has become played out. The indie community has positively run away with the genre over the past decade, producing projects that need to work increasingly harder to differentiate themselves from the pack. Still, this pressure has also bred some impressive innovation. Who would’ve thought the genre could be mashed well with a cute pinball game? Or what if your only movement option was teleporting? Super Awesome Hyper Dimensional Mega Team (no, that’s not a new Street Fighter game) has decided to take a crack at this lineage of more offbeat takes on the genre with The Knight Witch, a new Metroidvania that integrates the white-knuckle gameplay of a bullet-hell game like Ikaruga. Though it’s not perfect in how it executes mixing these styles, The Knight Witch still manages to offer a memorable and enjoyable experience that ultimately proves itself to be worthwhile.
The narrative in The Knight Witch picks up several years before the events of the game, when society was ruled by the industrious Daigadai clan. Their focus on progress at all costs destroyed the environment and led to a civil war, with the opposition being led by the titular Knight Witches. After a lengthy campaign, the Knight Witches defeated the Daigadai, but the fallout from their epic battle forced society to move underground to rebuild. Years later, the story places you in the role of Rayne, the secret fifth Knight Witch who was never powerful enough to join her sisters and thus went unknown. Things are peaceful enough in Rayne’s underground village, but events quickly take a turn when it’s revealed that the Daigadai weren’t completely wiped out and they’ve come back for revenge. With the famed Knight Witches scattered and broken, it’s thus up to Rayne to defend her home and defeat the Daigadai once and for all.

                              <span>Gotta go back in time.
Before the Wii U Pro Controller and the Switch Pro Controller, the general consensus amongst Nintendo fans was that the GameCube controller was, in fact, the very best plastic shell to enable the wiggling of various thumbsticks. Granted, when compared to what came before it - the safe, yet dependable NES and SNES controllers and uh... whatever that N64 thing was - the GameCube controller didn&#x27;t need to do a whole lot to come out on top, but it was nevertheless a comfortable, attractive piece of kit (if you ignore the rather terrible C-Stick).
If you, like us, long for the simpler days of the GameCube, then the good news is that you can practically turn your Switch into one with Retroflag&#x27;s Handheld Controller. It&#x27;s a transparent case that takes the iconic purple colour of the GameCube and whacks on a bunch of similar looking thumbsticks and buttons to pay homage to Nintendo&#x27;s cute little console box. You&#x27;ve got a proper d-pad here, green and red &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; buttons respectively, slightly curved shoulder buttons, and even a dinky little C-Stick in place of the regular right analogue stick.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

                              <span>Keep expectations in check, though.
Whenever a significant anniversary for a video game franchise looms on the horizon, certain parts of the internet inevitably start speculating about the potential announcement of a brand new game.
It&#x27;s not entirely unfounded, as some companies have used such milestones to break down their future plans, but we&#x27;ve been burned more times than we&#x27;d care to admit in the past with, shall we say, &quot;lukewarm&quot; anniversary celebrations from certain publishers (how did those Castlevania NFTs go for you, Konami?).

Back in July it was announced that Nintendo would be fully acquiring Dynamo Pictures - the production company behind the adorable Pikmin Shorts - and would be immediately undergoing a rebrand, naming the company &#x27;Nintendo Pictures&#x27;. Well, after launching its website last month, it appears that the studio is on the hunt for creatives.
In a tweet from the company&#x27;s official Japanese Twitter account (@Nintendo), the big N confirmed that it was opening the doors for job applications and encouraged anyone who wanted to get involved to apply.

Just last week we heard that Takaya Imamura was all set to release his debut manga, Omega 6, after years of iconic art work for Nintendo. This news gets all the more exciting today, as we have learned that Imamura is working to bring a version of his manga universe to a Switch game next year (thanks, Gematsu).
Omega 6: The Video Game - we have heard more creative titles in the past, we&#x27;ll admit - will see Imamura return to the seat of art director, while Happymeal studios are set to be working on the development side of things.

We&#x27;ve got the latest UK boxed charts data and its looking fairly self-explanatory this week, with FIFA 23 reclaiming its crown to take the spot in the midst of the 2022 World Cup.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II has also climbed a couple of spots this week to come in at number two, knocking Pokémon Violet down to third place. Pokémon Scarlet, in the meantime, slipped down a few more rungs of the ladder to claim the sixth spot, landing just behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and God of War Ragnarok.

No one could. But the infobahn baron played a role in my tale&#x27;s thrilling conclusion, and so my publishers are unthrilled by recent developments. They&#x27;re holding the novel&#x27;s launch back so I can address &#x27;the Musk issue&#x27; with a sequel released simultaneously. So as a Cyber Monday treat, allow me to top up your thrill levels with excerpts from book two: Original Content, a Non-Fungible Future drop.

                              <span>Yoshiro Kimura and his studio, Onion Games, are known for being off-beat. They make games that go in hard on their own strange internal worlds, wrapping up a particular sense of passion and energy in earnestly oddball humour. Undertale makes for a handy comparison - which makes sense, because many of the team worked on Moon, one of the games that inspired it. 
I&#x27;m telling you all this because it might pique your interest in their upcoming sandbox RPG, which we now know will be out at some point next year.

A new video series in which Liam and I spend our precious free time with massive live-service games to see how much they demand from our schedules. Are we able to truly experience everything these games have to offer without sacrificing the bits of our daily routines that keep us from withering away at our monitors? How many hours do you really need to invest in order to fully experience a game? And is it even worth it, in the end? 
Inventory Space will – hopefully – give you a better idea of whether mammoth games will slot into your life neatly, or not at all.

                              <span>Oi, you. Are you looking for a good time? A cosy time? I&#x27;ve got *opens trenchcoat* Townscaper, a no-stress little building toy. You&#x27;ll see colours for days, mate. Buildings popping up in all manners of shapes and sizes, no objectives or nuffin&#x27;. Ahh, you want the new stuff, eh? Well lucky you, I just got some Gourdlets in.
Gourdlets is another city-building sandbox with no purpose beyond placing stuff you think looks nice, only this time little blob dudes will come visit and interact with what you&#x27;ve built. The first taste is free, by which I mean there&#x27;s an Itch demo you can tinker with while we wait for the Steam version.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a bumpy road, but the new generation of plucky Settlers are at last approaching their destination. Now known as The Settlers: New Allies, Ubisoft&#x27;s Settlers reboot is due to come out on February 23rd.
Katharine quite liked what she played of the town-building RTS last January, but the devs decided feedback from their closed beta meant the game warranted more time in the oven, and thus a third major postponement since the game&#x27;s original 2018 announcement. Come watch the trailer below to see what&#x27;s new.

                              <span>Gaming monitors are great, but if we&#x27;re being realistic, they can very easily become one of the priciest building blocks in your entire PC gaming setup. If you are currently screen shopping, then, your best course of action is probably to take advantage of the current Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals.
My curated picks are all below, and as always, I’m only recommending sufficiently good hardware that’s available on a meaningful discount. A couple of our best gaming monitor members are even in here, though it’s a broad church overall, with 1080p, 1440p, and 4K screens making the cut alongside the occasional ultrawide model. We’re looking for gaming credentials specifically, too, so heightened refresh rates and support for variable sync tech (like FreeSync and G-Sync) are important.

                              <span>After more than six years of making games together, indie development team Sokpop Collective are just about to reach their 100th release in December. Hitting that milestone means the group have decided to change how they operate and adjust their Patreon. They’ll no longer be working to release one game per month. Sokpop are recommitting to releasing another 100 games though, so they’ll still be surprising us with intriguing diversions like village-building card game Stacklands or cutesy RTS King Pins. You can watch a trailer for their recently released 99th game, action RPG Springblades, below.

That’s partly stock running out, and partly retailers just being less willing to extend these sales over the weekend. Killjoys. Still, we’re not out of luck yet, nor out of laptops – as you’ll see below, there’s still a variety of deals to choose from, especially in the UK.

                              <span>Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That&#x27;s 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?
The board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn&#x27;t after a nostalgia kick.

                              <span>Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you&#x27;re mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what&#x27;s a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It&#x27;s not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.

                              <span>Synced (formerly Synced: Off Planet) is heading into open beta on December 10th, and has quite a few hyphenated terms applied to it. This sci-fi game is both squad-based and match-based, a roguelite hero-shooter, and Tencent&#x27;s publishing division Level Infinite even go as far as describing it as a rogue-looter, of all things. Whatever you want to call it, though, the main thrust of the game is about finding and taming machine creatures known as Nanos in a techno-apocalypse, mostly so you can battle more Nanos inside a special sealed zone called The Meridian. Come and see what to expect when the beta begins in an exclusive gameplay trailer below.

                              <span>With Black Friday now demoted to &quot;Last Friday&quot;, it’s the turn of Cyber Monday to host the handful of remaining SSD deals. Thought it’s more than a handful, really – multiple big, stretching fistfuls of quality PC storage deals are still running, and should continue to do so until the clock strikes midnight. Or until they run out of stock. Hopefully the former.

                              <span>For what has felt like my entire life (but was probably only the months of October and November) every ad I was served on YouTube was for a sale on Her Interactive&#x27;s Nancy Drew games. I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?
Anyway it clearly didn&#x27;t matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.

                              <span>It was only a few days hence that we spotted a low price on the Ryzen 9 7900X, but for Cyber Monday there&#x27;s an even better deal on offer at Amazon UK. 
The deal price is £456.70, versus a normal price of £600, and is for stock from Amazon US - but that includes shipping, import duty and all other potential fees. There&#x27;s even the possibility that fees are less than expected, as several US items I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazons overseas have come with small discounts.

                              <span>Two of the best gaming mice - and indeed, the best ultralight mouse in the RPS guide to gaming mice that are good - are going exceedingly cheap on Amazon UK today. The Pulsefire Haste and Pulsefire Haste Wireless are ideal for competitive and casual gaming alike, with lightweight designs and high-end specs, and now you can pick either for little. 
The wired Pulsefire Haste (£20, normally £50) is the cheaper and lighter option, weighing in at 59 grams, while the wireless Pulsefire Haste Wireless (£40, normally £90) offers more freedom but requires recharging every 100 hours. It also weighs a tiny bit more, at 61 grams.

                              <span>In 2010, the makers of Swiss Army knives introduced a new model for the digital age: the Presentation Master. To help you dominate PowerPoint presentations on the battlefields of corporate warfare, the knife&#x27;s fold-out tools included a laser pointer, a Bluetooth remote control for changing slides, and a USB thumb drive. I need it. This is an amazing cyberpunk PC peripheral, and a rare product targetted at megacorp middle-managers rather the leather-clad rabble of hackers, scavs, and street samurai. I need it so much.

                              <span>A remake of Like A Dragon spin-off Ryū Ga Gotoku Kenzan could potentially happen, but devs RGG Studio say they&#x27;ll only consider it if the series&#x27; other upcoming spin-off Ishin is a “a huge hit.” The comments came up in a recent interview by Ungeek with RGG Studio executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama and chief director Hiroyuki Sakamoto. Although the remake of Ishin was announced during Sony’s September State Of Play stream, Kenzan seems quite far from being picked up for a revamp.

                              <span>Matthias Linda is feeling tense. Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he&#x27;s been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there&#x27;s &quot;still so many little and not so little things to do&quot; before the big day hits on December 8th. &quot;[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,&quot; he says over email. &quot;I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.&quot;
But he also says he&#x27;s &quot;happy at the same time&quot;. After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it&#x27;s clear Linda&#x27;s got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat&#x27;s also unlike anything else I&#x27;ve seen. You&#x27;ve still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you&#x27;ll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party&#x27;s abilities and you&#x27;ll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you&#x27;ll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It&#x27;s a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda&#x27;s desire to &quot;build a bridge between the worlds&quot; of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.

                              <span>Grim co-op action game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is out on PC on Wednesday, and devs Fatshark have taken a load off players’ minds by confirming that progression from the pre-order beta will carry over. Although Fatshark had mentioned in previous Steam updates about the game’s beta that player progression might not be fully guaranteed, they tweeted over the weekend to let players know that progression will be maintained once the game’s released. I do like that they address everyone as “rejects” in their announcements, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

The vast majority, in fact – I was expecting to spend most of this morning sweeping away expired deals, but most of the hardware that was discounted on Black Friday is still on sale for Cyber Monday at identical prices. Sometimes, even for a few coins less.

The 25-year-old racing series has always been a die-hard exclusive for Sony’s consoles up until now.

                              <span>Developer Offworld Industries, the studio behind Squad, has revealed Starship Troopers: Extermination, a new 12-player cooperative FPS coming to Steam Early Access next year. 
Offworld is making Extermination in collaboration with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and in the game, players will engage in squad-based FPS combat to exterminate the arachnid threat fans of the 1997 film will know really well. Those squads will need to work together in order to complete objectives, acquire resources necessary to continue the fight, build and defend a base of operations, and ultimately, escape to the one extraction point as a team.

                              <span>Sega released Sonic Frontiers earlier this month and while fans have been finding plenty of fun in this new open world-ish take on the blue blur, they&#x27;ve also been running into some bugs. Fortunately, Sega is releasing a new Sonic Frontiers patch on all platforms to address some of these bugs and bring additional optimization to the game. 
This news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Japanese Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account that reveals update 1.10 &quot;fixes an issue where the boss would sometimes disappear when retrying the boss battle on Chronos Island,&quot; as reported by Video Games Chronicle. This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. 


Other fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. 
While waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer&#x27;s Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU&#x27;s future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC&#x27;s entertainment output. 
When asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are &quot;planning to give more DC characters TV shows that&#x27;ll add to the story for the DCEU,&quot; Gunn responded, &quot;Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).&quot; In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, &quot;Yes.&quot; 
Yes.
November 27, 2022
It&#x27;s an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios&#x27; MCU. However, MCU plans don&#x27;t include video games because Marvel&#x27;s video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel&#x27;s Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.
In fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it&#x27;s important that each studios&#x27; Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.
This is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it&#x27;s the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer&#x27;s Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that.

Last week a California court found Arvin De La Santos liable for $150,000 in copyright infringement damages, a &quot;landmark&quot; win according to Triller.

First place went to Sony&#x27;s recent release God of War: Ragnarok. It was followed by another PS5 title. Bandai Namco&#x27;s award-winning hit Elden Ring took out fourth place, and further down the list were a number of different games that also happen to be available on the Nintendo Switch and eShop.

Chief among them is Jsaux&#x27;s line of Steam Deck compatible docks. If you decide you want something with a lower price than Valve&#x27;s official hardware, then you can currently find the JSAUX 6-in-1 Steam Deck dock for just $38/£40 as part of this weekend&#x27;s Black Friday deals.

I hope that you&#x27;re all having a fine holiday and that the Thanks/Friendsgiving Turkey/Turkee Day festivities have afforded you at least one extra day off. If not, never fear, you can always cheer yourself up with some pointless Black Friday tat. I myself picked up a microphone and well, a couple of Blu-Rays... I don&#x27;t have the need for anything else really. Of note, it is also freezing here in Blighty, with chilly winds and low-pressure headaches suggesting a coming blanket of white. Winter is on its way, so I hope ya&#x27;ll be keeping warm.

Sometimes, when a new Pokémon game nears, questions loom. Pokémon are mysterious creatures. Where do they come from? What are their natures? Why do professors send children out into the world on unpaid scientific internships and have them participate in illicit, unethical animal fights?
Well, instead of doing that last part, here at Destructoid we usually turn to Occams for answers about Pokémon instead, via the encyclopedic Occamsdex. It&#x27;s better than getting arrested for unpaid child labor and/or creating a new Micheal Vick.
And thus, we asked the Destructoid community to submit Pokémon for his judgment once more!

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).

                              <span>The Crucial X6 is a USB solid state drive that I keep recommending, as it offers dependable SATA SSD speeds in a convenient yet rugged form factor.

                              <span>Mainstream 2TB SSDs just barely breached the £100 barrier for Black Friday this year, and now the Integral V Series has firmly pushed beyond it. You can now pick up this 2TB SATA SSD for just £93, making the drive just 4.7p per gigabyte - a very reasonable asking price for a drive that&#x27;s significantly faster than an old HDD you may still have in your desktop or laptop...

This week is a very special one for the retro purveyors over at Hamster Corp, this week sees the publisher hit 300 consecutive weeks of console releases, having rolled out almost six years&#x27; worth of golden oldies to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range. And, befitting the importance of the occasion, the publisher is taking it right back to the 1970s, with a rerelease of Namco&#x27;s first major smash hit, Galaxian.
Released to the burgeoning arcade market in 1979, Galaxian was Namco&#x27;s effort to capitalize on the earth-shattering success of Taito&#x27;s 1978 release, Space Invaders. Following a similar formula, Galaxian has the player control a space vessel at the foot of the screen, taking on patterns of enemies that form in concurrent lines across the top of the screen.

If golf is a great way to ruin a walk, fishing must therefore be the best way to ruin a perfectly good drowning. Traumatizing the most food-motivated creature on earth is a reasonably relaxing pastime, don’t get me wrong, but when I’d go out on the lake with my father, he’d always over-coach. I don’t even know how that’s possible, but that man found a way.
Cocoto Fishing Master found its way into my collection because my husband really loves the fish on the cover. “It’s just so happy!” he’d exclaim, using this playful but unspellable vowel pronunciation that we’ve developed over our years of being that really weird couple.

                              <span>Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN has revealed that one of its reports played a role in the criminal investigation of Z-Library. The report in question reportedly identified a number of suspects. Whether the resulting law enforcement actions will be effective in the long run is unknown but BREIN plans to seek a site-blocking order if the shadow library reappears on the surface web.

While playing online at webDiplomacy.net, it&#x27;s achieved &quot;more than double the average score of human players&quot;, ranking &quot;in the top 10 percent of participants who played more than one game&quot;. It can figure out who needs persuading to do what, then engage with those players using impressive and effective natural language.

It&#x27;s an arena fighting game geared towards couch co-op and couch competition, but there&#x27;s online play and single-player modes too. Yesterday&#x27;s &quot;THE TRIALS OF JAZEPS&quot; update added new difficulty levels to wave survival, as well as custom trials you can send to your friends. 

It also chucks in some new maps with portals, because the only thing better than a lightsaber-wielding spider is a lightsaber wielding spider suddenly emerging from a portal.

                              <span>With the possible exception of Gwent, mini-games inside open world RPGs tend to suck. They&#x27;re often poor imitations of much deeper and exciting board and card games you can play in the real world, offered as an unwanted break from the monsters I&#x27;ve come to stick a sword through. Will Genshin Impact&#x27;s upcoming Genius Invokation TCG buck that trend? 
Probably not, no, but we&#x27;ll know for sure when the Version 3.3 update lands on December 7th. There&#x27;s also a new quest that takes place after the game&#x27;s main storyline, a couple new playable characters, and a Breakout mini-game. Ah. I do actually quite like Breakout.

                              <span>It’s getting to the time in winter when we reflect on the year, and pick our Bestest Best games that we’ve played over the past twelve months (okay eleven months, but December is always kinda quiet). We recently had this chat in the RPS hive-mind, and going through each month and making note of my favourite releases completely shocked me with how many fantastic mystery games have come out this year. It’s honestly awesome. 
I’m a huge fan of mysteries in games, with some of my all-time favouites being Kentucky Route Zero, The Return Of The Obra Dinn, and Disco Elysium. I just like getting wrapped up in a good story that will kick my brain into gear. Strange murders, devious disappearances, and just general strange happenings - I love all of it.

                              <span>Half-Life Alyx: Levitation is the most compelling reason to dust off my VR goggles I&#x27;ve seen since Half-Life: Alyx. Out today after two years of development, the ambitious mod promises 3-4 hours of barrel-chucking, window-breaking, train-dodging, combine-blasting fun.  
Perhaps the full package will pale in comparison to Valve&#x27;s polish, but the bit in this trailer where the player scurries down a train while contorting around manhacks looks oh-so appetisingly transportative. I think it&#x27;s time I dug out my lighthouses.

                              <span>Back when our guide to the best Black Friday gaming mouse deals was but a wee list of early offers, I’d check every few days whether the Logitech G Pro Wireless had a compelling sale going for it. Every time, nada, at least in the UK. Only now, during Black Friday proper, has its price dropped – and damned far too, with Amazon chopping £70 off the RRP to bring our top wireless gaming mouse pick down to just £50.

                              <span>Playing Nidhogg is like playing a dozen frantic games of rock-paper-scissors back to back. Like all the best couch co-op games, it&#x27;s very easy to get to grips with the controls: you have a sword, and you can raise it or lower it across three different heights to try and get around your opponent&#x27;s guard. There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other&#x27;s blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.
Oh look, now I&#x27;m holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I&#x27;m holding scissors! Oh, and now it&#x27;s paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running. Fair enough, I suppose.

While I was there, I also had the chance to interview three of the series leads: Tom Heaton, creative director on both The Devil In Me and Man Of Medan; Will Doyle, creative director across the whole Dark Pictures Anthology and director of last year&#x27;s entry House Of Ashes; and Dan McDonald, the studio director for the anthology.

It&#x27;s not often that I recommend one here, and jokes aside, it&#x27;d be unfair and untrue to say it&#x27;s because there aren&#x27;t enough good ones. It&#x27;s more that I don&#x27;t have much room for new ones.

Lilith Odyssey is, if we must, a survival game and a roguelike (oh, the many dispara-[yeah alright, alright. Jesus. - ed.]), but that is reductive. This is a strange and somewhat contradictory game I feel uneasy comparing directly to anything, except possibly the wonderful Taxinaut (which is now on Steam, incidentally). Lilith Odyssey is very much what I&#x27;d call a vibes-based game.

                              <span>Black Friday generally doesn’t involve as many CPU deals as it does, say, SSD deals or gaming keyboard deals – probably because there just aren’t that many CPUs. Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

                              <span>During my journey into the depths of TikTok&#x27;s dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that&#x27;s now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It&#x27;s been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called &quot;dabloons&quot; cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It&#x27;s as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

                              <span>A tiny bridge makes so much sense as a late-game Vampire Survivors challenge stage. The game&#x27;s arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It&#x27;s pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday&#x27;s appropriately titled &quot;The Tiny One&quot; update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

                              <span>Sometimes, my friends, the Internet pulls something out of the ether that truly stumps even the most knowledgeable and informed among us. Case in point: today’s rumblings that Grasshopper Manufacture, the devs behind the No More Heroes series, are working on a AAA game in the Aliens universe. This caught Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s founder and CEO Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, so much by surprise that he wordlessly tweeted his utter bemusement at the rumour. I’m taking that as a no for the Alien game, then.

This change allows whoever is setting up one of the game’s Immortal Empires campaigns in multiplayer to fiddle with the endgame how they please. Devs Creative Assembly have even gone and done one of those video thingies for the update, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Another Black Friday means another opportunity for the Logitech G502 Hero - RPS readers&#x27; most favouritest gaming mouse - to get nice and cheap. This button-rich desk rodent is a particularly common sight during big PC hardware sales like Black Friday, but it&#x27;s hard to tire of seeing when it&#x27;s one of the best gaming mice ever made, and I actually prefer it to the recent G502 X refresh - especially when it&#x27;s 56% off. That&#x27;s precisely 56% off in both the UK and US, too.


Alright, technically it&#x27;s the Logitech G502 Hero SE (Special Edition) that has the best available price in the UK; the standard model is £5 more for some reason. But the only difference between this and the all-black G502 Hero is the addition of some white highlights, so otherwise they share the same comfortable shape, highly customisable 11-button layout, and sharp 25,600dpi sensor.

                              <span>The magic of Yakuza games (now known as Like A Dragon, technically but hey) lies in the dramatic ascents up the Millenium Tower to prevent surprisingly muscular 60-year-old men from detonating Kamurocho. The rain falls. The lads rip their suits off. Then they settle things with their fists, because to do anything otherwise would be silly.
But the real magic of Yakuza lies in its minigames, one of the best being karaoke. And thanks to Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, we now know why their games are obsessed with the beloved singsong.

                              <span>Imagine not being fazed that a powerful demon cursed you, while maintaining your style and composure to investigate how to free yourself before your time’s up. I’m not sure I could manage not to totally lose it under those circumstances, but survival horror Sorry We’re Closed from devs à la mode and publishers Akupara Games plonks you into the vaguely 32-bit shoes of cool cucumber Michelle to do exactly that. The game takes the familiar fixed camera angles from classics such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone In The Dark, but combat’s being handled in first-person. Have a look for yourself below, and watch out for your third eye.

                              <span>It’s still the frigid morning of Black Friday 2022, but there might already be a superlative gaming laptop deal up for grabs. Here in the UK, Ebuyer has an RTX 3070-equipped version of the MSI Katana GF66 laptop down to just £950 – a saving of £449.


Not only is that a big, meaty chunk of cash to carve off, it’s also an outstandingly low price for a gaming laptop with the RTX 3070 specifically. I’ve seen this high-end GPU in a few other laptops that are up for Black Friday sales, but they’re tending more towards the £1100 mark. In terms of getting the most graphical power for the least money, then, the Katana GF66 is unlikely be beaten today. Even by the RTX 3080 laptop for £1200 deal that&#x27;s still going.

                              <span>Activision Blizzard executive vice-president for corporate affairs Lulu Cheng Meservey has tweeted that the company “won&#x27;t hesitate to fight to defend” Microsoft’s $68.7 billion (£57 billion) buyout of the publisher. The comment came after reports began circulating that the US Federal Trade Commission could bring a lawsuit against Microsoft over the deal. Anonymous sources claiming to be close to the matter also suggested that a lawsuit from the FTC might begin as early as December.

However, that is slowly changing, with Black Friday Eve bringing a new low price on the high-end CPU: £475, down from a launch RRP of £600. That&#x27;s a tidy £125 discount and a great price for one of the fastest consumer CPUs money can buy.

That&#x27;s a tiny fraction of the original £239 price point, and one heck of a Black Friday discount on one of the best value gaming monitors of recent memory.

                              <span>I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. 
Even more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…</span>

                              <span>​God of War Ragnarök is a world full of scowling gods and monsters butting heads as they each work toward their best interests. The nine realms are dark and dangerous, but through all of that shines a beam of unexpected light, and I am not talking about Brok, the dwarf who seems incapable of finishing a sentence without including some kind of vulgarity before meeting the period at the end. I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.
Ratatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability. Atreus could summon the translucent blue squirrel to bring health items and sometimes hacksilver. In God of War Ragnarök, Ratatoskr is a physical, non-translucent c…</span>

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on December 20.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What&#x27;s the best gaming-related gift you&#x27;ve ever received?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...</span>

It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                              <span>Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn&#x27;t faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game&#x27;s success to share how Sonic&#x27;s second outing became one of Sega&#x27;s driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

Popular Android applications TeeTV, BeeTV and CyberFlix, have popularity all wrapped up, but the hard bit comes next.

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the compensation after the Navy was shown to have copied and used software without permission. Whether Bitmanagement will celebrate this win is up for question as the damages are less than 0.1% of the $155 million it asked for.

It’s the NZXT Canvas 27Q, which I recently called the best 1440p gaming monitor you can buy. And that was before it felt the force of a 30% Black Friday saving, with £116 sliced off the RRP.

There’s loads more Morrowind in 2022 than I could’ve imagined as a teenager though, as the Tamriel Rebuilt mod project has been working for decades to add other areas of the Elder Scrolls’ provincial mainland into the game. Their latest release, 22.11, landed this week, adding a huge one-two punch of expansions. You can see some of one of those, Dominions Of Dust, in the trailer below.

But though it be sad, it is an occasion nonetheless, which means Matthew is going out in style as we build the ideal video game character dinner party. Spoilers: there is a giant ant and a boat full of cocaine.
As it&#x27;s his last day, Matthew also does a fiendishly difficult Cavern Of Lies themed around secret endings. Which of us will end up dead and loaded onto the cocaine boat while the others beat a retreat?

                              <span>Upgrading to an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X or Ryzen 7 7700X could prove trickier than with an Intel equivalent, as while the latest Core CPUs give you a choice of using DDR4 or DDR5 memory, the Ryzen 7000 family is only compatible with the newer and more expensive DDR5. There’s no re-using old DDR4 sticks with AMD’s latest and greatest, then, but with this week’s Black Friday deals you could get a brand new DDR5 kit for less.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll have heard by now that Pentiment is bloody good. It&#x27;s a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It&#x27;s inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).
In the ol&#x27; days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren&#x27;t educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You&#x27;ve probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.

                              <span>Like many free-to-play live service games these days, Overwatch 2 loves its skins. Occasionally though, Blizzard stumble with their cosmetic offerings, rather like they’ve tripped over an invisible dog. Players have been taking to Twitter and Reddit to voice their irritation with support hero Moira’s rather uninspired new legendary skin, based on the classic black and white look of mime artists everywhere. Just like mime artists themselves, it’s not very popular.

The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is by far my favourite gaming headset of 2022, the one I employ right now for everyday use, and as part of Amazon’s early Black Friday sales is down to £100. That’s a £90 saving on the RRP, and the cheapest that this set of wireless cans has ever been in the UK.

Technical artist Charlie Banks has popped the base-building app up on NexusMods, and has used it to create a massive robot that looks a little like the Iron Giant squatting down. Banks compares the base-building app’s simplicity to Oskar Stålberg’s procedurally generated hamlet-crafter Townscaper, although it seems a bit more complicated than that game.

The four FTC commissioners haven’t voted to decide on a complaint yet, and haven’t met with Microsoft or Activision Blizzard lawyers, two of the sources said.

                              <span>The propellers spin down, and I step off the puddle-jumper plane onto the tarmac of the tiniest airport I’ve ever visited. Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...</span>

                              <span>In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard jump into Outer Terror, an upcoming pulp action-horror game coming to PC sometime soon. 
The two discuss the game&#x27;s visual style, how it plays, its similarities to Vampire Survivors, and everything else going on in this exclusive preview. This demo build features a small snippet of one of the game&#x27;s five volumes and our gameplay showcases how the on-screen action works, the horrors from beyond, and how quests work in Outer Terror. 
Check out Outer Terror for yourself below in this installment of New Gameplay Today: 


As you can see, Outer Terror is shaping up to be a great time, perfect for those moments where you&#x27;ve got 10 or 15 minutes to blitz through hordes of the undead, monsters from beyond, and more. For more about Outer Terror and what to expect from the game, check out our coverage of the game from last month. 
Outer Terror hits PC via Steam and the VoxPop Games Store (with exclusive content on that storefront, too), but a release date has not yet been revealed.

It’ll be a night of celebrities, game announcements, and an infamous afterparty full of alcohol, confetti, and blaring music. It’ll take over Twitter, and leave more than a few people nursing headaches the following day.
But today, instead of focusing on his big night, studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama is sitting in a conference room talking about why he loves Neon Genesis Evangelion. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo&#x27;s history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.</span>

                              <span>Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …</span>

Officers from Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit teamed up with South Yorkshire Police to execute warrants on Tuesday. The arrest arrives in the wake of stronger-than-usual rumors that police were preparing to hit pirate IPTV entities during the World Cup.

The original platform&#x27;s .com domain was retired many years ago after its operators felt Hollywood breathing down their necks. That doesn&#x27;t mean their old domain is worthless though. The Putlocker brand remains popular and just recently the putlocker.com domain sold at auction for more than $100k.

If you celebrate it, happy Thanksgiving! If not, there&#x27;s a few games to potentially pick up.
The marquee on for this small-ish week is The Knight Witch, which is due out on November 29 on the Switch eshop (also on Steam). It&#x27;s a promising looking Metroidvania, with a few interesting concepts (like accessibility/mechanical toggles) and a spell system that also promises shmup gameplay.
That&#x27;s pretty much it in terms of this week. Things will start picking up a little more as we head into the holiday season, and things quiet down in mid-December or so.

                              <span>Get. in The Ring
SNK has offered up more information pertaining to the second season of its excellent team-scrapper The King of Fighters XV — From January 2023, new characters, modes, and under-the-hood tech tweaks will begin a steady rollout across all platforms, bringing further excitement to one of the long-running franchise&#x27;s best-ever entries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kCsTzOoWZZ0
Season 2 starts with the dawning of the new year, bringing with it a brand new character balance update and the first DLC fighter of season 2: Kyo Kusanagi fanboy and good-hearted goof Shingo Yabuki. As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.
In addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms.

                              <span>Season’s greetings from Destructoid’s least-American writer
It&#x27;s that time of year again! And as the Destructoid office closes for a much-earned weekend of merriment, it is once again up to yer boy Moyse to celebrate a holiday that has absolutely nothing to do with him. That&#x27;s fine, because I like spending the holidays with you. Besides, you&#x27;re never alone if you have a talking Dusa plush from Fangamer. Anywhoo, &#x27;tis Thanksgiving, or Friendsgiving, or Turkey Day, or even Turkee Day (for my vegan pals). Whatever you call it, it amounts to good food, a weirdly aggressive bout of Black Friday capitalism, and a much-needed break from the ol&#x27; nine-to-five.
It can be tough to find thanks lately, after all, we are still somewhat mired in a relatively unhappy global situation. It has been this way…</span>

                              <span>Cult fighter to receive major upgrade
SNK&#x27;s fab and precise fighting title Samurai Shodown is currently preparing to make a comeback, bolstered by the power of some slick new rollback netcode. The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title&#x27;s new functionality.
The beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter&#x27;s online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.
The arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho&#x27;s devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here&#x27;s hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.
Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

CD Projekt Red showcased the upcoming next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt today, and it looks pretty great. From big updates to small little changes, it seems like a really good excuse to dive back into this massive RPG.
The special REDstreams showcase aired today, going over the details of what&#x27;s to come for the update. While it&#x27;s a next-gen boost for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, PC owners will also be able to take advantage of the tune-ups too. To start, here&#x27;s a trailer:

On the graphics side of things, consoles will get the option for a performance or graphics mode. Performance will target 60 FPS, while the graphics will aim for 30 FPS with ray tracing.

                              <span>A fresh look at what Dead Island 2 has been up to
Dead Island 2 is rising from the beyond to share more of what the team&#x27;s been working on. A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.
The stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.

What&#x27;s the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of &quot;action, gore, and zombies.&quot; Hopefully we get to see some details of what&#x27;s in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.
Rising from the grave
It&#x27;s at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it&#x27;s been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.
“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”
More delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.
We&#x27;ll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.

                              <span>Age Of Empires 4 is the first RTS I&#x27;ve taken seriously. I&#x27;ve practised build orders, memorised specific civ counters, watched pro matches and agonised over key bindings. I have gone down into the nitty gritty of sheep micro, just to shear off microseconds from early villager gathering times, but I&#x27;ve never seen a good reason to build half of the landmarks in the game. It&#x27;s a blessed relief, therefore, to see &quot;landmark improvements&quot; on the roadmap for Season 4, alongside a new mode and a funky purple-looking biome.

Battlefield 2042 is now available on Game Pass, along with a new map, specialist, weapons and Battle Pass gubbins for Season 3. Most folks seem to regard 2042 as a misstep compared to the triumph of Battlefield 1, but hey, Game Pass is a great way to check if they&#x27;re right. You can&#x27;t shoot railguns in the swedish wilderness back in WW1, can you now.

Developers Rockfish Games also promise new missions, legendary items, and a &quot;significant overhaul of our level-scaling approach&quot;.

Vanilla Witcher 3 still looks gorgeous for a nearly seven year old game, but the upcoming update will add ray-tracing options, ultra+ settings and a suite of other visual and quality of life updates. 
It&#x27;s not out &#x27;til December 14th, but you can peek at it below while the devs natter in the background.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good romcom. As soon as the fateful meet cute happens, you&#x27;ll find me curled up with a blanket swooning over the blossoming romance. Bumping into someone while getting on the train or getting in an elevator might be a minor part of your day, but for a romcom protagonist, it ignites the love story they&#x27;ve been waiting for. They were ready to fall in love and probably hoped for a meet cute because they wanted a surprising story that they could tell everyone about. Like a good romcom, State of Decay 2 often has ways to generate unexpected stories that we&#x27;re secretly hoping will happen. Let&#x27;s call it a meat cute.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is a game where you control a little pixellated person who auto-attacks periodically. Your aim is to survive for as long as possible as hordes of slime and bats close in around you, and it&#x27;s an excellent time. So excellent, in fact, that it&#x27;s already seen a few spin-offs.
And having sampled a couple of Vampire Survivor-likes, it&#x27;s made me appreciative of the game&#x27;s visual clarity. Yes, things can get messy, but at least you&#x27;re able to make out what&#x27;s happening on screen. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something the subgenre has quite grasped yet.

                              <span>Sometimes you just gotta play the hits, which Amazon are very much doing with their early Black Friday keyboard deals. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless is an enduringly comfortable, responsive, and strikingly slim gaming keyboard that’s a regular feature of sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day, and once again it’s on sale now – both in the UK and in the US.
This time, it’s also being joined by its tenkeyless little brother, the G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless. This shares the same finely-crafted, all-mechanical build and solid wireless connectivity of the full-size model, merely cutting the number pad in pursuit of a smaller desk footprint and a lower price.

                              <span>Not content with your telly or your tablet, Netflix has begun making moves on your PC. The streaming giant is recruiting people to work on “a brand-new AAA PC game”, seeking those with knowledge of Unreal Engine and “experience with FPS and/or third person shooter games”. The ad for their lead engineer specifically refers to the game as a third-person action RPG. 

The new hires will join former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, team lead at the newly formed Netflix Games Studio. Who knows if they&#x27;ll make anything good, but at least it&#x27;ll probably come free with your &#x27;flix.

                              <span>Fantasy doesn’t really do guns very often, preferring to stick to the ol’ sharp pointy metal things that don’t fire bullets instead. I do enjoy when the odd boomstick appears in magical realms though, so I’ve got one eye trained on tactical CRPG Dark Envoy. Putting you in the gunpowder-loving shoes of a refugee adventurer exploring the fantasy world of Jäan while total war rages, you can also bring a pal along in a similar way to Divinity: Original Sin’s campaign co-op. Watch a little of Dark Envoy’s isometric steampunk world in action in the trailer below.

Given that hexes aren&#x27;t going anywhere and dynamic music is scarce, sure, let&#x27;s celebrate dynamic music and hope for more. This week, I ask you to decide between two very different types of attack. What&#x27;s better: overwatch reaction attacks (not Overwatch the game, okay), or the ridiculous gunfire overload that is dakka?

                              <span>I had to check this particular Black Friday deal three times to make sure the specs were right, but yes, you can indeed get an RTX 3080-equipped version of the Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop for £1200. That’s hundreds upon hundreds of pounds less than the average RTX 3080 laptop, even during the current season of early Black Friday offers. 


Until Nvidia get around to making a mobile version of the RTX 4080, this is the second-most powerful RTX laptop GPU you can get, so it’s much more commonly found inside £2000-plus models. Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed. And it’s not like the other components are guff: the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is a perfectly adequate octa-core CPU, and the Nitro 5 ignores slow mechanical storage to equip itself with a 1TB SSD.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life&#x27;s calling. My eyesight&#x27;s terrible, for one, and I guarantee I&#x27;d be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d even make it through the doors at NASA. They&#x27;d take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game&#x27;s story.
There&#x27;s a good reason for this, though, and it&#x27;s one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she&#x27;s anything but. In fact, when she&#x27;s climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home&#x27;s little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game&#x27;s gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It&#x27;s a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers.

                              <span>Not long ago I watched my Warzone Legacy, a two-minute-long compilation of my best stats from the first game, which included my K/D ratio and hours played and the like. It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.
My history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it&#x27;ll last in the long run and confirms that there&#x27;s still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.

                              <span>Free to play superhero card battler Marvel Snap is getting a Power Cosmic update for PC and mobile on December 6th. The big deal with this update is the arrival of Collector Tokens that’ll let you snap up cards you want from the new store. Given the name, it’s not surprising to hear that some fresh, cosmic-themed rare cards are set to land too, including the Silver Surfer and his absolute unit of a mate, Galactus. Watch the dev update video below for more of ever enthusiastic developer Ben Brode talking about what’s coming in the Power Cosmic update.

That would be double what GTA Online players managed during the last Heists Challenge two years ago, when the target was set at the much lower amount of $100 billion. Rockstar are promising a “special reward” later this year if the community hits that $2 trillion total in stolen cash. Buy out Twitter in time for Christmas, maybe?

I’ll be upfront here; I like Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. They move the series forward in several important ways, and there are moments here that are the highest highs of the franchise’s history. Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet are also ridiculously buggy. The performance issues are so rampant that they will impact your experience, regardless of your tolerance for low framerates. This is unacceptable for the largest multimedia franchise on the planet.
But you know what? I&#x27;ve had some hearty laughs encountering glitches in this game. There are so many weird, unpredictable oddities in Scarlet &amp; Violet that I almost look forward to discovering them. In a perfect world, Game Freak would have intentionally made Pokemon do weird stuff in the background just for the player’s amusement. …</span>

Ragnarok has come and gone for the God of War series. And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.
In a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he&#x27;s asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.
&quot;I don&#x27;t know man, that game is big,&quot; said Williams. &quot;I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.&quot;
While there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn&#x27;t too surprising. God of War (2018) didn&#x27;t receive any extra DLC.

Patience, boy
I haven&#x27;t rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it&#x27;s a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I&#x27;d be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.
Ragnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.
What could those projects be? Well, in the Kinda Funny spoilercast, Williams does mention he&#x27;d love to make a Castlevania game. It&#x27;d be a sight to see if that collaboration ever does work out.

                              <span>Running with the pack
NetEase Games has made a &quot;strategic investment&quot; in the up-and-coming Polish studio Rebel Wolves. The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.
&quot;We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. &quot;Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development.&quot;
This &quot;world-class AAA game&quot; is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team&#x27;s strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title&#x27;s release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.
NetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.
Despite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.

The long-running legal case regarding controversial Cooking Mama: Cookstar has finally drawn to its conclusion, with The International Court of Arbitration ruling that publisher Planet Entertainment did indeed infringe upon Office Create&#x27;s IP with the 2020 release.
Available for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Cooking Mama: Cookstar fell into controversy immediately, with rumors swirling that it utilized the Nintendo Switch hardware to mine cryptocurrency. Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn&#x27;t the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company&#x27;s right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.
&quot;Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve,&quot; said Office Create at the time. &quot;Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.
&quot;Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create&#x27;s approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create&#x27;s approval.&quot;
Following this week&#x27;s legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves. To date, the most recent official Cooking Mama release was Apple Arcade title Cooking Mama: Cuisine! which launched in July of this year.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asking for years, bring it on
In 2012, Nintendo released Kid Icarus: Uprising to the masses, and I was enamored. I couldn&#x27;t put that game down for hours at a time, and amid some odd 3DS controls (that I did get used to!): it was one of my favorite games of that year, and that entire era. It was bubbling with more personality than the vast majority of games released even still, and it was like watching a cartoon in game form. 10 years later, Masahiro Sakurai is ready for it to make a return. 11 years ago, I was too!
In his latest game creation/development class video, Sakurai muses on difficulty: specifically, how Kid Icarus approached the concept with &quot;the fiend&#x27;s cauldron.&quot; In case you skipped over Uprising entirely (which is extremely likely!), the gist is that players can set …</span>

                              <span>End of line for Onoma
Square Enix Montreal, which recently changed its name to Onoma, has announced that it is to shut down service for four of its mobile titles. The quartet of games will officially end service on January 4, 2023, ahead of the studio&#x27;s announced closure.
Hitman Sniper: The Shadows; Deus EX GO; Arena Battle Champions; and Space Invaders: Hidden Heroes will be removed from the iOS App Store and the Android Store on December 1. Additionally, all in-game purchases have been suspended. On January 4, all four titles will be rendered unplayable. No refunds will be issued for the initial game purchase or any DLC downloads.

Square Enix Montreal, founded back in 2011, was mostly focused on the creation of mobile and free-to-play titles, finding a small but dedicated audience with its GO strategy series, which utilized famous IPs such as Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex. The studio was picked up earlier this year as part of a transaction that saw holding company Embracer Group acquire much of Square Enix&#x27; western subsidiaries, including studios Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, along with their respective IPs.
Soon after, it was announced that Square Enix Montreal was rebranding as Onoma, which appeared to signal a new lease of life for the company. However, in a shocking turn of events, the studio&#x27;s closure was announced mere weeks later.

This isn’t a Top 10 Action Games of All Time list or a Top 10 Action Games of a Generation list.

Street Fighter 6 is no different in this regard. Amid the new additions like Kimberly, Jamie, and Luke, longtime players can find comfort in the presence of fighters like Ryu, Chun-Li, Guile, and Ken appearing as well. However, even those returning fighters have some changes to their looks, outfits, and personalities for this sixth mainline entry.
During our trip to Osaka, Japan, where we visited Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, we sat down with Street Fighter 6 art director Kaname Fujioka to learn more about his time at Capcom. &quot;The biggest inspiration for me wanting to join Capcom and work on fighting games was Street Fighter II,&quot; he says. &quot;I w…</span>

                              <span>A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon &quot;Emblems,&quot; characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.</span>

Multiplayer is a must, but something competitive might not be the way to go – there are only so many games of Mario Party and Monopoly a group of people can play together before they want to rip each others&#x27; heads off.
In this case, co-op is the way to go: specifically, something everyone can play in the same room on the same TV. But with so many games out there, how do you separate a perfect holiday gift from a dastardly holiday grift? Fret not! We&#x27;ve compiled a list of some of the best games to turn that seasonal boredom into wintertime wonderment.

With Google, Cloudflare, Namecheap, and EasyDNS named as defendants, the court has already ordered the suspension of several domains and their removal from Google&#x27;s search results. Interestingly, DaftSex.com was recently seized by MindGeek so is not a pirate site.

                              <span>Valve have been awarded a patent for a new virtual reality motion controller. It looks a lot like the Meta Quest controllers, with a ring design at its top rather than the flat face of the previous Valve Index motion controllers. Its inclusion could be a further suggestion that Valve&#x27;s next headset will be standalone, without the need to be plugged into a PC.

                              <span>Colony sim RimWorld added ideologies in an expansion last year, prompting Nate to force drifters to knife-fight a unicorn (among other things). There have been other RimWorld expansions however, and while each has added a substantial new chunk of content, those systems have previously been unable to interact with each other.

That changed with RimWorld 1.4, which adds &quot;cross-expansion integration&quot;, so now you can use the ideology system from the Ideology expansion to, for example, tell stories about people who have ideologies about the biotech from the biotech expansion.

                              <span>Yesterday we covered a great deal on discounted Xbox Series Wireless Controllers at Currys, and today I&#x27;m back to share a similar deal that sees Sony&#x27;s DualSense controller down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen. Right now you can pick up the PC-compatible controller in white for £40, a £20 reduction from its normal price of £60.

                              <span>Here’s an early Black Friday deal for anyone still prodding at a mushy membrane keyboard: in the UK, you can get the all-mechanical Cooler Master SK652 for just £45. If you go for the black model, that’s a £65 saving off the RRP, and it’s £95 off if you opt for the white version, which is £45 as well.
£45! And it&#x27;s full-size to boot. There are always nice savings to be had among Black Friday’s gaming keyboard deals, but even then, the only way you’d normally see a mech board this cheap was if it was secondhand. And had keycaps missing. And was haunted, possibly by some kind of dismembered hand ghost.

                              <span>Lisa: The Painful is one of those games that’s like… if you know, you know. You know? Like, it’s ruthless, stomach-churning, and soul-destroying. I’m kinda joking but also not joking? I don’t know what it is about RPG maker games, but they just hit different.
Set in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.

                              <span>When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. &quot;Everything was a dive bar,&quot; Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. &quot;It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was.&quot; His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich&#x27;s father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (&quot;As a result I&#x27;m hugely into shuffleboard&quot;, Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.
Back in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they&#x27;d put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn&#x27;t matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park&#x27;s massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. &quot;The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,&quot; Popovich says.

Ever since it hit Early Access on Steam last December, the cult of Vampire Survivors has grown and spread its gospel far and wide. Over the past year, the seemingly simple game has expanded with a steady stream of free updates adding astonishing amounts of depth and content. The fantastic gameplay and compelling progression system combined with a ridiculously low price point made Vampire Survivors extremely recommendable. That tradition continues in the full game release making over…</span>

When users tried to access illegal streams, a warning message claimed that they had already been tracked. With fines now being received through the mail, police are making some extraordinary claims about how this was made possible.

                              <span>The AMD EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; processor performance has been outright phenomenal. These new AMD server processors have shown stunnning performance with up to 96 cores per socket and beyond the increased core count is now up to 12 channels of DDR5-4800 memory and most significantly in the HPC space is the introduction of AVX-512 support with Zen 4. Even the 32-core high frequency Genoa performance has been dominating against Intel&#x27;s current Xeon Scalable competition. While AMD EPYC Genoa brings very impressive gains generation-over-generation and against the current Xeon Ice Lake CPUs, curiosity got the best of me for seeing how the new AMD EPYC CPUs compare to AMD&#x27;s original EPYC 1st Gen &quot;Naples&quot; flagship - the EPYC 7601 2P. Here are Genoa benchmarks showing how far the AMD server/HPC CPU performance has evolved over the past five years since Naples.</span>

Terayama, member of Capcom&#x27;s in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly&#x27;s music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly&#x27;s old-school tastes pair well with the game&#x27;s hip-hop inspirations.

                              <span>In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard discuss Atari Mania, the new Atari microgame collection that plays like WarioWare. The two take you through the game&#x27;s opening, showcasing what exactly you do in this Atari museum as its sole caretaker, from sweeping away dust to killing bugs and more. 
The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the museum experience in the game gives players the chance to admire high-quality screens of classic Atari game box art, game manuals, and more.

                              <span>Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

                              <span>Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s an easy one. Sometimes it&#x27;s agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you&#x27;re rolling with. While you&#x27;re at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you&#x27;re kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!</span>

This week, the &#x27;team&#x27; behind the Pirate Library Mirror launched &quot;Anna&#x27;s Archive&quot; which offers a gateway to various book resources. A brazen move, but one where risks and privacy were carefully considered.

                              <span>Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>Trinity Fusion is an upcoming futuristic sci-fi action-roguelite that looks great, and its first closed beta begins today. 
Developer Angry Mob Games announced today that you can sign up for the beta right now, which will run through November 24. If you don&#x27;t make it into this round of playtesting, don&#x27;t worry – you might get an invite to access the second closed beta beginning December 6. It will run until December 13. Before signing up, though, check out the Trinity Fusion reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too.

                              <span>Update, 11/17/2022:
Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below:

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
&quot;New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we&#x27;d give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2,&quot; a blog post about the new season reads. &quot;Hailing from planet Mars and sent to destroy Earth with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, M…</span>

New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

&quot;This Omega-Level Threat is a new endgame challenge headlined by a climactic confrontation with the deranged genius to end the danger once and for all,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The Lab is a challenging AIM base that players will navigate before facing off one last time against MODOK in a grand multiplayer fight.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…</span>

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
