                              <span>Artifacts are an excellent tool for turning tides in various PvP and PvE engagements in Verse Piece. They give incredible buffs and unique effects that are not found anywhere else in the game. If you want to know which Artifacts are good or bad and which ones are a must-have, then follow our Verse Piece Artifact guide and tier list below.


Verse Piece Artifacts Tier List

Farming for Artifacts in Verse Piece is hard work, but don&#x27;t be discouraged if you do not get the best ones, like Ice or Saiya Artifacts, at first. A good starting one is the Intelligent Artifact because it reduces all your cooldowns. Another good pick is the Wind Artifact, which lets you zoom around the map. Use the Turbo and the Recovery artifacts only if you have no other options.

The latest evolution requires you to spend 75,000 coins to unlock, so it&#x27;s not available for free. However, the stat upgrades are pretty good, and the addition of a new playstyle+ is pretty effective. Let&#x27;s take a look at all the requirements, followed by the upgrades and the best players to use.

The new Depths introduce formidable foes like the Frox. To defeat it, Link must use bombs or arrows to break its defenses. Here&#x27;s a map showing all 39 Frox locations.


All Frox Locations in Tears of the Kingdom

Froxes can only be found in the Depths. Fortunately, they&#x27;re extremely easy to find since they&#x27;re out in the open. All you&#x27;ll need to know is their coordinates. Here are all of the Frox locations in TotK:


1: Southeast of the Takaruk Lightroot, and southwest of the Kegopa Lightroot, you&#x27;ll find an Obsidian Frox. It lives in the clearing below where Trotter&#x27;s Downfall sits on the surface map. Its coordinates are (3036, -0867, -0512)…</span>

A few of these require you to return items to their original owners, although details of who those original owners are aren’t exactly forthcoming. 


One of these “Around the Island” quests involves Echo Conch shells. There are a total of 10 to find hidden throughout the many locations of Friendship Island, and you’re given no more than a cryptic clue to help figure out who they belong to. 


Some are obvious just from their appearance, but others pose more of a challenge. Here’s where to find each Echo Conch, and who to return them back to.

Ditto is the master of disguise. At any time, it can transform into any other Pokémon, and that can pose a problem if you hunt it in Pokémon GO. Thankfully, Niantic has made it slightly easier by limiting the number of Pokémon that Ditto can become, although this list does change every so often. 


Finding Ditto in the first place can prove to be something of a nightmare because it never shows up in its own skin, and that’s without throwing in the hunt for a nice, blue, shiny one. Here’s what Pokémon Ditto can show up as right now in Pokémon GO, how you can get a shiny one, and why it mi…</span>

What are the most overlooked NES games?


Monster Party

Imagine you are strolling along a quiet village road. All of a sudden, thunder strikes, and everything turns grim, bloody and scary. That is the first level in Monster Party, a game that somehow managed to pass almost unscathed the fiery censorship eyes of early 90s Nintendo. This is one of those rare full-on horror games on the NES, with so many references to classic genre movies such as The Thing and Little Shop of Horrors.

How multiplayer works in Monster Hunter Wilds


First, you will have to enter a lobby. Whether it’s any type of lobby will be up to you. Preferably, you’ll want to create a Private or an Online Single Player one.

Once in a game instance, perform the following to invite friends:



Press your options button or bound key to bring up your “Items &amp; Equipment” menu.


Head over to the Communication tab.


Hit either “Link Party” or “Invite a Friend.”

Best starting weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds, ranked


Just because this list will show what we consider to be the best starting weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds does not mean that these are overpowered or better than the others. This is more for ease of use and getting accustomed to the game’s mechanics.


Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword and Shield, and Dual Blades


These weapons are quite flexible and can be understood rather easily. They also pair well as primary or secondary weapons for something more complicated.

Both items are pretty powerful, and endgame players will find it easier to access them. To get the Fuga chant move, you&#x27;ll have to clear an exclusive quest.


How to get FUGA Flame Chant in Jujutsu Infinite


The FUGA chant is a stronger version of the Flame Arrow, and it can be used only when your character is within its Domain Expansion. This ultimate move can do an incredible amount of damage in general, and you will have to complete an exclusive quest, which can be obtained from the Frost Sorcerer NPC.



You can find the Frost Sorcerer NPC outside Yuki Town. He will be located near the Snow Fortress.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Karma.
Big, bold characters. Comfortable story beats that deal with multiple worlds, gods, and the power of friendship. Confusingly titled battle systems. And colourful anime openings featuring J-pop songs. The Tales series has made a name for itself over the last 30 years for many different reasons, and it&#x27;s why many — myself included — call it the comfort-food JRPG.
Despite growing up with big names like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew that RPGs were my genre: Tales of Symphonia&#x27;s release on the GameCube.

Hello dearest pals, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Before we dive into this week&#x27;s battle, let&#x27;s see how things panned out last time. The lovely Jim took the opportunity to crank out a few LotR quotes with a look at the GBA version of The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. Unsurprisingly, the Western design absolutely crushed it with 90% of the vote. Sheesh... Normally Japan provides us with some rather tasty box art designs, but this one was a bit naff, right?

Strangle 5+ different enemies to death


Marry someone you met at the gym



The most difficult part of this challenge is strangling five enemies to death. This doesn&#x27;t just mean finding random people; you need to make them your enemy before eliminating them. Having the Assassin&#x27;s Blade will make it easier, but you can still do this in a regular vani…</span>

New content continues to be released by the developers following the Atlantis update, and the Valentine&#x27;s Event is all about the latest offerings. If you&#x27;re looking for a new boat to add to your collection, the Swan Boat could be the perfect choice for you. Similarly, there are two different variants of the Lovestorm Eel for you to catch.


How to get the Valentine&#x27;s Event exclusive Swan Boat in Fisch


The Valentine&#x27;s Event has added an exclusive event NPC, who can be found at Moosewood (350, 135, 330). The aim is to catch as many fish as possible, and the rewards will be unlocked as you complete certain milestones.

The new Sanchez item is pretty decent but the base Pace (88) could have been higher. With 5* Skills and 90 Dribbling, he will feel absolutely amazing on the ball. That said, he could have had better finishing, but the SBC has decent value. If you&#x27;re using a Premier League-based squad, the Morgan Rogers Future Stars SBC is a far better choice.

However, not all of them are created equal, so think carefully before settling for any one Ability. To make your choice easier, we have created a simple and detailed Verse Piece Abilities guide and tier list below.


Verse Piece Abilities Tier List

The tier list above ranks all Abilities in Verse Piece based on their overall damage and the utility they provide in and outside of battle. The S-Tier Abilities, such as Cid&#x27;s Atomic(All range), Kurohitsugi(Maximum Output), and TNT, are especially powerful and should be aimed for when rerolling.

                              <span>Unlike traits and races, titles in Verse Piece don&#x27;t increase your damage or your stats in any way. However, good titles make grinding levels and Gems a lot easier, especially early on. So, to help you out with unlocking all of them, we prepared the following Verse Piece title guide below.


What are Titles in Verse Piece?


Titles in Verse Piece multiply all Money, Gems, and XP that you get by killing mobs and Bosses or by rolling on the gacha machines in the Verse Arcade. Titles are unlocked in various ways. For example, you can get titles by leveling up, completing quests, and killing Bosses. Some titles are also needed to unlock certain Specs and Swords.

From the lush landscape of Eriador in The Fellowship of the Ring, where the Ring-bearer originally sets out towards the Mountain of Fire, to the rolling hills of Beleriand where the Elves of the First Age contended with Morgoth the Black Foe and spun many tales of tragedy and triumph into existence, here are J.R.R.

                              <span>Unlocking the option to play with other humans (multiplayer) increases the scope of Civilization 7 by a massive margin, as it allows you to test your wits and strategization powers to the fullest.


While the AI can prove to be a stern test, it can feel repetitive after a while. Thankfully, Civilization 7 fully supports multiplayer, as you can play with your friends to find out who&#x27;s the best. In fact, the presence of online play also raises the scope for playing with strangers over the internet or organizing local events.


How to setup multiplayer in Civilization 7


To play online, you&#x27;ll have to open a 2K account. This step is free, but it&#x27;s mandatory for any online session. If you already have an account, just log in.


Once you&#x27;re signed into your 2K account, you&#x27;ll be able to join a lobby and participate in the game present on it. Alternatively, you can even create your own lobby and invite your friends/other players to participate. Civilization 7 offers you full control over your lobby, as you can tweak the basic rules, decide on the starting age, and more.


You can also enjoy an offline multiplayer mode, which works via a functioning LAN network. This is suitable if you and your friends are present at the same location and have multiple devices. It&#x27;s a great alternative to the online system. If you&#x27;re on a console, you&#x27;ll need an applicable subscription to host/participate in the online sessions.




Does Civilization 7 have hot seat multiplayer?


As of the early access, there is no hot seat multiplayer function. Having the feature is perfect if you&#x27;re looking to introduce the game to your friends, as they can play on the same device. There&#x27;s always a chance for the feature to be introduced later as part of a future update.

The origins of many terrible things from real life will forever remain a mystery to the greater public. When it comes to the microtransaction-filled video game hellscape of nowadays, however, we can pinpoint the exact time and place in history when the future human resistance failed to send a Terminator to.

                              <span>Fisch has kicked off its Valentine&#x27;s Update event, and while there aren&#x27;t new rods, there are some lovely new Eels available. If you&#x27;re planning to add these limited Eels to your Beastiary, this guide can help you. Here&#x27;s how to catch the Lovestorm Eel in Roblox Fisch.


Before you catch a Lovestorm Eel

Before you catch these limited Eels, keep in mind that they can only be caught during the Lovestorm event. Simply log in during the Valentine&#x27;s event, do your usual thing, and wait for a message to pop at the top that says that the Lovestorm event has started. Head to the location, look for the fish pool (obviously, use a fish tracker to find the pool), and start casting.


How to catch a Lovestorm Eel


Lovestorm Eels are really difficult to catch. You&#x27;ll know you hooked one if you get a whopping -90% Progression Speed. It&#x27;s definitely going to be a long battle, so it&#x27;s advised you equip yourself with a rod that boosts progression (A Zeus Rod, Kraken Rod, or the No-Life Rod are fantastic for this). Check out our Complete Fisch Roblox Rod List, Locations, &amp; Crafting Recipes if you need help with finding any of these.

While the Lovestorm Eel is going to be a bright Valentine pink, you can also catch many of its mutated forms.


That&#x27;s all there is to it. Good luck with catching a Lovestorm Eel, and don&#x27;t forget about everything else in the Valentines Update. If you need a boost, check out our Fisch codes guide.

One of the best reasons to play the Luigi’s Mansion series is the simple joy that comes with exploring new, spooky environments. Truly, the locations are the star of the show.
The first entry in 2001 was arguably too short and a bit too easy and repetitive, but its titular mansion was a compelling backdrop.

Crikey, it only feels like yesterday when we all sat down to discuss our weekend plans, doesn&#x27;t it? Don&#x27;t worry folks, that April Direct will be here before you know it.
Anyway, let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s been going on in the world of Nintendo this week. First up, the company revealed its latest financial data in which the Switch was confirmed to have surpassed 150 million units sold.

The Switch 2 is obviously the big focus for Nintendo moving forward, but one other area of business it plans to continue is mobile applications.
During the company&#x27;s Q&amp;A for its latest financial earnings, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company&#x27;s &quot;current position&quot; when it comes to smart devices and the &quot;plans for them going forward&quot;. Unsurprisingly, it&#x27;s &quot;continuing to develop new game applications&quot; for mobile as it remains a &quot;very important&quot; touchpoint for consumers.

Nintendo has already confirmed it will be supporting the Switch in 2025 with new software, but what is the plan for the system beyond this year?
During the Q&amp;A of Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial results briefing, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged the balancing act shifting from one generation to another - mentioning how the Japanese firm would like to continue releasing new titles on the original system, but also noting how &quot;crucial&quot; exclusives are when it comes to new hardware.

                              <span>Rumours point to a brand new whip-cracking game.
Konami&#x27;s beloved Castlevania series is back in the headlines at the moment — season 2 of Castlevania: Nocturne dropped on Netflix a few weeks ago (and, spoilers, it&#x27;s very good). But the rumour mill is running, and it&#x27;s pointing towards a brand new Castlevania game.
Yesterday, Chinese-based journalist and GamesIndustry.biz contributor Daniel Camilo has heard from &quot;reliable sources&quot; that a brand new &quot;AAA&quot; Castlevania game will be revealed this year (along with a few other notable series). And Portuguese website GeekInOut has corroborated the rumours via its own sources &quot;with knowledge of Konami&#x27;s plans&quot;.

It probably says something about the system that the question &#x27;y cant metroid crawl?&#x27; is one of the most memorable nostalgia nuggets from the Wii U era.
Don&#x27;t get me wrong - while the initial messaging was poor, the GamePad&#x27;s killer apps never really arrived, and the system itself was slow and bulky, I still loved my Wii U. But with Nintendo spending the last eight years picking at its carcass and making its greatest hits accessible on 150 million more consoles, many memories made by the Wii U&#x27;s faithful few are now muddled with the shinier &#x27;Deluxe&#x27; versions.

One of the biggest criticisms we, and indeed the Zelda community at large, had with Echoes of Wisdom was its awful UI design for the echoes.
It&#x27;s a rare blip in what is otherwise an exceptionally well-crafted Zelda title in which you&#x27;re presented with a single row of echo abilities that simply widens further and further as you accumulate more during your playthrough.

Just a reminder that this sale is wrapping up on Sunday night, so if (like us) you&#x27;re getting &#x27;47 games on your Wishlist are on sale!&#x27; emails from Nintendo, you&#x27;ve got until the end of the weekend to make a dent in them.
Also, while we&#x27;re here, we did double-check to make sure this really was the number of games we&#x27;d scored 9 or higher! Our editor tried to squeeze Just Shapes &amp; Beats in there but, as was pointed out, that&#x27;s still on sale on Monday so isn&#x27;t technically part of the Supercharge sale. But definitely check that out, too! Okay, carry on.

Hideki Kamiya has stated on social media that he would rather players not experience Okami via the 2008 Wii port (thanks, Automaton).
Originally released on PS2 back in 2006, Okami&#x27;s move to the Wii was handled by the now-defunct American studio, Ready at Dawn. When creator Kamiya was approached by a fan and mistakenly asked whether it&#x27;s recommended they start with the Wii original, Kamiya responded to clarify that the PS2 version is the true OG.

Cape Cosmic, the developer behind the fabulous Phoenotopia: Awakening, has announced its next project — Star Iliad, a Metroidvania set inside a star whale. And, par the course, the pixel art looks gorgeous. Platforms have yet to be announced yet.
In a blog post on the developer&#x27;s tumblr, Cape Cosmic reveals that its new game leans much closer to a Metroid game rather than Phoenotopia&#x27;s Zelda-esque trappings. The map is much larger, with the devs promising 40 hours of gameplay, and guns are your weapon of choice.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s do the time warp again.
On Western shores last yast year, Falcom started a fresh arc in its long-running flagship franchise with The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, breathing new life into the series while offering a great jump-in point for newcomers looking for a place to start. With the overall Trails series rapidly nearing the conclusion of the epic story it’s been building up for the last couple of decades, Falcom has now released The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, allegedly the final release in this arc. This sophomore outing for Van and crew feels a little more uneven than its predecessor, but is ultimately a worthwhile new entry.
The plot picks up not too long after the previous game, starting once again with protagonist Van Arkride taking a midday nap on the couch in his office. He’s soon visited by his old friend Elaine from the Bracer Guild, who alerts him to reports of a new serial killer on the loose in Calvard. As the local Spriggan (a sort of private investigator), this would already be in Van’s wheelhouse, but there’s an additional detail that raises the stakes: the killer somehow has their own Grendel form, which was previously thought to be unique to Van. The two thus set out on the trail (heh) to track down the killer.

Publisher Pqube and PixelHeart, alongside developer Migami Games, have revealed that their new metroidvania Chronicles of the Wolf will be launching on Switch this Summer.
This one looks like it will appeal specifically to Castlevania fans, and seems to be taking quite a few cues from Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest. You&#x27;ve got day/night cycles, merchants, allies, and of course, lots of beasts to slay. In another nod to Castlevania, it&#x27;s also been confirmed that Robert Belgrade, famous for his role as Alucard in Symphony of the Night, will be providing narration duties.

                              <span>Plus, another mysterious controller is included.
A new patent from Nintendo was recently made public which seems to confirm that, yes, the upcoming Switch 2 will indeed feature mouse support. Phew.
However, upon digging into the patent a bit more, we discovered a couple of additional nuggets that might be of some interest. Namely, it appears that Nintendo has showcased what looks to be a Joy-Con for the original Switch with the additional optical sensor on the side (alongside that extra &#x27;C&#x27; button below the Home button, by the way – don&#x27;t ask us why it&#x27;s missing on the left image below).

Square Enix has released its latest financial update looking at the nine-month period ending 31st December 2024 in FY2025.
Overall, although net sales and operating income are down YoY for the wider business, the company has hailed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake as a success, stating that operating income in its digital entertainment sector is slightly up &quot;due to stronger sales of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake than initial assumptions&quot;.

                              <span>&quot;We’re very sorry to have let you down&quot;.
Sega and Sports Interactive have officially cancelled Football Manager 25 after extensive internal discussion and careful consideration.
Sports Interactive says it&#x27;s &quot;very sorry&quot; to have let down fans and will now shift its focus to the next annual release. The reasoning behind this decision, although it&#x27;s not specifically mentioned, seems to be the transition to the new game engine. It was planned to be the &quot;biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation&quot; laying the foundations for a new era.

                              <span>Roguelike deckbuilders need to do something pretty special to stand out nowadays, what with the Slay The Spileup of bangers over the past few years. Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Rocksteady Studios haven&#x27;t said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims &quot;the new project is years away from landing&quot;, so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio&#x27;s open world Batman games.

                              <span>Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that Grand Theft Auto 6 is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA&#x27;s arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

                              <span>The Nvidia RTX 5080 is out! Kind of. In theory. If you can find one. But here’s the thing: it&#x27;s basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.

The release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was spotted this week, hiding in the long grass of the PlayStation Store. The fancy-schmancy MGS3 remake is coming out in August, according to the store page. And you can also catch sight of a camouflaged trailer if you go looking under the right rocks.

                              <span>Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio&#x27;s employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel Smite 2 as a free-to-play beta. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they&#x27;re being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

                              <span>What great hopes I had for the Christmas holidays. Finally, I thought, I would have time for some of the recent blockbusters I&#x27;d not yet played: Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and more would fill those dusty days and nights in the taint of 2024.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench&#x27;s games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever,&quot; responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be given a refund, they say.

                              <span>Britské bezpečnostní orgány nařídily americké firmě Apple, aby vytvořila takzvaná &quot;zadní vrátka&quot;, která by umožnila dostat se k šifrovanému obsahu uživatelů uloženému v cloudu. Tajné nařízení, vydané v lednu, vyžaduje plošný přístup k šifrovanému účtu jakéhokoliv uživatele přístrojů Apple kdekoliv na světě. Britské úřady tedy Apple nežádají pouze o asistenci s přístupem k účtu konkrétního uživatele, ale rovnou chtějí mít přístup ke všem účtům, kdykoliv budou chtít.</span>

The move follows similar orders obtained last year against DNS resolvers.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not the destination, they say, it&#x27;s the pickled eggs we slurped along the way. In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

                              <span>Earlier this week, a plastic bag blowing in the wind made me question all I knew about the world, but in whatever way the opposite of life-affirming is. Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other&#x27;s crotches for eternity.
I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here&#x27;s a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

                              <span>True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

                              <span>The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer Duskers are making a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the 2016 space game. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they&#x27;re currently working on. The working title for this one is &quot;Humanity 2.0&quot; and it&#x27;ll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you&#x27;ll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer &quot;fun personality quirks&quot; when you install upgrades, &quot;like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it&#x27;s now claustrophobic&quot;. 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I&#x27;m interested.

                              <span>Sci-fi battle royale Apex Legends is due a &quot;meaningful update&quot; , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he&#x27;s called &quot;Apex 2.0&quot;. To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game&#x27;s name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it&#x27;s not clear if that&#x27;s exactly what he means.

                              <span>Freshly unsealed court documents reveal that Meta downloaded significant amounts of data from shadow libraries through Anna&#x27;s Archive. The company&#x27;s use of BitTorrent was already known, but internal email communication reveals sources and terabytes of downloaded data, as well as a struggle with limited availability and slow download speeds due to a lack of seeders.

The collapse of the Fmovies empire and the conviction of a person linked to a major IPTV provider, marked rare progress in a difficult region. Yet, increasing doubts over what happens next in Vietnam has sparked concerns that not even the biggest wins offer guaranteed progression.

                              <span>When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a &quot;weaver band&quot;, a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

                              <span>Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

                              <span>The first wave of Nvidia 50 series GPUs have arrived. Now they&#x27;re gone. So, if you need an RTX 5080-prebuilt gaming PCs are currently your best bet of securing. While Dell has got some overpriced $5000+ Alienware 51 desktops up for preorder, there other (considerably cheaper, but not necessarily affordable) options up for grabs right now.

                              <span>Vendrán Las Aves - &quot;The Birds Will Come&quot; - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a &quot;slice of life tamagotchi&quot; and available in Spanish and English, it&#x27;s a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It&#x27;s free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody&#x27;s one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have &quot;overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem.&quot; We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t end up covering as many classic point and click adventures as I&#x27;d like on RPS. That&#x27;s a real shame, because every time I play a good one, I&#x27;m reminded how much magic the genre still has. Developer Blyts (Kelvin And The Infamous Machine) was kind enough to send me over a key for Slender Threads, which is out this Friday. My opinion as a complete non-expert on the genre? Yep, this one&#x27;s absolutely worth a look.

It&#x27;s the sort of boast most demon swordsman like to trot out, in my experience. And yet! I have to admit that this Gogandantess lad has a real flourish to him. He&#x27;s going places, I reckon. Chief among those places being PC at some point in 2025, and he&#x27;s bringing the rest of Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny with him. Catch him showing off in the below trailer.

However, a poster released for the movie online by Marvel led to some backlash as some believed it was created using AI image generation. But Marvel is pushing back and claims that’s not the case.

                              <span>Warhorse&#x27;s medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It&#x27;s an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra&#x27;s tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. 


In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I&#x27;ve encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2&#x27;s eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

                              <span>Several hours in, it’s become apparent that I lack the patience for much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s much-publicised historical accuracies, like needing to bathe yourself every six minutes or how 15th century Bohemians can take several consecutive sword swings to the neck without dying. Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

                              <span>If, like me, you failed and failed and failed to get a decent score in arcadey reaction game Super Hexagon, then take solace in this: there are a bunch of other games by the same developer you can fail at. Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry&#x27;s Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry&#x27;s short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called Grab Them By The Eyes.

                              <span>Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty&#x27;s Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I&#x27;m not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That&#x27;s a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he&#x27;s &quot;hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,&quot; write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

It&#x27;s a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind Forgotton Anne - one of my favourites from 2018. Forgotlings, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a Steam demo. This is such good news I&#x27;ve basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.

                              <span>I was initially sceptical that we&#x27;d be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game&#x27;s creator Venris on YouTube. He&#x27;s co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around &quot;eight to 12 hours a day&quot;, though, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as &quot;Darkest Dungeon, but you&#x27;re running the dungeon&quot;. That&#x27;s better than anything I could come up with, so let&#x27;s stick with that.

This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt&#x27;s taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM&#x27;s collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They&#x27;ve previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi&#x27;s jacket. I&#x27;m not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn&#x27;t afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let&#x27;s try and keep an open mind about this. The bag&#x27;s Dyneema fabric &quot;is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials&quot;.

                              <span>I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was Roots Devour - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.

                              <span>Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It&#x27;s about to-- ah, too late, you&#x27;ve been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka&#x27;d buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it&#x27;s a lot of producers talking a big game about &quot;levelling up&quot; the &quot;core experience&quot;, which seems to remain blasting a building you don&#x27;t like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game&#x27;s actual running and/or gunning.

                              <span>After several hours of battles, sieges, imprisonment and torture in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a groggy Henry of Skalitz is woken by a servant girl in a castle outside Kuttenberg. She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He&#x27;s a blacksmith&#x27;s son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn&#x27;t have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn&#x27;t be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it&#x27;s more than her job&#x27;s worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she&#x27;s dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

                              <span>There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called &quot;the piss filter&quot; and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there&#x27;s at least one developer who is reviving &quot;smeared dirt&quot; as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

In 2024, over 500,000 websites were subjected to blocking measures, pushing the all-time site blocking total to more than 1.8 million. While VPNs also face blocking, the task isn&#x27;t always straightforward. The data shows that sales sites in Russia prefer to expose IP addresses owned by foreign companies, located outside Russia.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no ideal time to promote a blocking system that by design restricts freedom and, for the vast majority of citizens, offers no tangible benefit. Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA&#x27;s export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

                              <span>The future of AI innovation may hinge on the outcome of a global copyright debate.  In the U.S., rightsholders are taking a hard line, pursuing legal action against AI companies that utilize copyrighted works without permission.  However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in &#x27;pirate&#x27; libraries. This &#x27;copyright schism&#x27; could have far-reaching consequences.

                              <span>Musi&#x27;s initial attempt to force Apple to reinstate its music app to the App Store has failed. A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It&#x27;s the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke &quot;all roadmaps lead to Rome&quot;.* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

                              <span>The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are &quot;disappointing someone&quot;. Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

                              <span>Hidden away on NASA&#x27;s Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out &quot;the vast sorrows and all the vexations&quot; of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

                              <span>Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I&#x27;m well aware that &quot;2.5D&quot; and &quot;Soulsvania&quot; are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every &#x27;vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It&#x27;s a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can&#x27;t - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game&#x27;s compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

                              <span>Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of &quot;turning towards the future&quot;. It dreamed of &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;. Nowhere in the post did the word &quot;layoffs&quot; appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: &quot;we don’t require support from the full studio.&quot; 
It&#x27;s one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of our &quot;favourite&quot; mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically &quot;sunsetted&quot; rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

                              <span>The last Minesweeperalike I wrote up was a sparkling slurry of mind-altering pop-ups and resinous AI cleavage. It was David Cronenberg&#x27;s Minesweeper: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I&#x27;d put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It&#x27;s Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.

                              <span>The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;, as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they&#x27;re looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay&#x27;s recent blog about BioWare&#x27;s future, but he comments only that they&#x27;re &quot;taking the opportunity to reimagine&quot; how BioWare operate between projects, and &quot;have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.&quot; Which is a very slippery way to say that you&#x27;re making a load of people redundant.

                              <span>Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

                              <span>Looks like they finally got the message. &quot;An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC,&quot; said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It&#x27;s been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn&#x27;t seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they&#x27;ve now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

                              <span>A new report from consultancy firm Mediavision provides data on IPTV piracy that the Swedish government didn&#x27;t want to hear. Between spring and fall of 2024, illegal subscriptions increased by a record 25%, with an estimated 700,000 households now regularly paying to pirate. The government considers a &#x27;viewing ban&#x27; for citizens but, there appears to be no clear idea how or even if that would work.

                              <span>Pirate site blocking orders are a step closer to becoming reality in the United States after Rep. Zoe Lofgren introduced the Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act earlier today. Should it become law, FAPDA would allow rightsholders to obtain site blocking orders targeted at verified pirate sites, presumably run by foreign operators. The blocking orders would apply to both ISPs and DNS resolvers. The latter is a novelty.

Official updates have been sparse, but according to a new message posted by the operators, they&#x27;re having trouble paying the bills. Further details are lacking, but the call for help resulted in a healthy stream of crypto donations, which will be of interest to anti-piracy groups too.

That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build &#x27;n&#x27; crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There&#x27;s good reason to trust the developers&#x27; ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it&#x27;s all core, no loop.

                              <span>Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That&#x27;s a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You&#x27;ll wish you&#x27;d been dusted by nuclear fire when you&#x27;re being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line&#x27;s headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there&#x27;s now a demo available via the developer Discord.

In brief, it&#x27;s a VR collaboration between D&amp;D traffickers Wizards Of The Coast and Demeo studio Resolution Games that aims to simulate a tactical co-op tabletop experience without any of the boring bits, like seeing your mates&#x27; genuine reactions to things or having your frigid digitised soul warmed at the hearth of human kinship.

                              <span>Nic says that RPG remake sequel Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is &quot;uneven, unfocused, and unmissable&quot;. You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

                              <span>Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

                              <span>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of the 2016 launch version of No Man&#x27;s Sky, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it&#x27;s only getting more and more, er, infinite.

                              <span>Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody&#x27;s finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who&#x27;ve been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who&#x27;ve grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what&#x27;s this, there&#x27;s a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sniper At Work is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for &quot;soothing merge-2 experiences&quot; featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only &quot;twos&quot; you shall be &quot;merging&quot; in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only &quot;cherries&quot; you shall be &quot;picking&quot; are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that &quot;soothing&quot; - I won&#x27;t judge. I will only repeat Nic&#x27;s observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look &quot;a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman&quot;, which I would translate to &quot;my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here&quot;. Right, that&#x27;s enough quotation marks for one article. There won&#x27;t be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this immersive sim offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone&#x27;s car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I&#x27;m still messed up about it, honestly.

                              <span>A Nintendo lawsuit filed last November targeted video gamer Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru. Given the scope of the allegations, narrowly focused on a single defendant, the action seems unusually punitive. Yet if the plan was to push Keighin into a corner, the Colorado resident hasn&#x27;t read the script. Allegations of destruction of evidence, obstructing service, and abuse of Nintendo&#x27;s legal team, combine to make a dire situation even worse. But not for Nintendo.

I am thankful that the handheld LCD graphics of the era did not allow me to witness my companion blob&#x27;s amiable decline into shit-caked starvation. I am also thankful that my tamagotchi did not itself have a tamagotchi, because the only life principle I ever taught my tamagotchi was neglect. This is also the reason I may never play the reportedly pretty decent virtual pet game Yoke Heroes: A Long Tamago, whose developers 14 Hours Productions are defying God and Man by developing another virtual pet sim inside it.

                              <span>Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and Outriders studio People Can Fly will be co-developing Gears Of War: E-Day, the upcoming shooter in the long-running series of games about large men doing large violence at large bugs from behind medium walls. This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They&#x27;ve also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a pronounced horror slant, with the &#x27;Emergence Day&#x27; of the title referring to the insectoid Locust&#x27;s first visit above ground.

                              <span>In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It&#x27;s sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it&#x27;s nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that&#x27;s launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it&#x27;s inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They&#x27;re letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

It&#x27;s the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

It&#x27;s a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I&#x27;m too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I&#x27;m not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot. There is talk on the radio of dangerous folk out at night...

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we&#x27;re getting Team Ninja&#x27;s Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I&#x27;d do a bit about stealth drops but I&#x27;m at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here&#x27;s a trailer:

                              <span>I reckon you&#x27;re likely to be in one of two camps with precision platformer Bauhaus Bonk - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word &quot;bopping&quot; -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It&#x27;s a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don&#x27;t know the name of so I&#x27;m just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can&#x27;t really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I&#x27;m not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

The latest reminder being Snow Town Geek Store, a shopkeeping sim brimming with 2000&#x27;s non-tude. Like the 2000&#x27;s themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment. But I do very much enjoy both its energy and soundtrack, based on what little information is currently available. A tray-tray for you, the discerning tray-tray viewer:

                              <span>Continuing last week&#x27;s Maw merchandising roll-out, may I introduce by popular demand the first official Maw-endorsed letter opener. Now now, don&#x27;t act coy! I know some of you are old enough to know what a letter opener is, or even to own one. Statistically, most of the RPS readership are Lich Lords. The Maw letter opener differs from regular letter openers in that when you open a letter with it, you will encounter not a letter but a perfect copy of yourself opening a letter in the opposite direction. The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter. It&#x27;s yours for a piffling three pints of any available body fluid, but if you don&#x27;t want to buy a letter opener you can always buy one of this week&#x27;s new PC games instead.

                              <span>Could we perhaps chart the entire course of technological innovation as a story of things not fitting in other things quite as well as some reckless genius had hoped? Something to ponder on, perhaps, as we behold the Steam Brick. As reported by PC Gamer, one Crastinator-pro has documented their journey to transform the Steam Deck into a controller-less, screen-less creature of ineffable bricktitude. Why? Because the Deck didn&#x27;t fit in their backpack.

                              <span>Doom is back, and this time it’s bringing its signature blend of demon-slaying chaos and heavy-metal energy to medieval times. Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5—unless you’re eyeing one of the pricier editions, which grant early access starting May 13. Naturally, our attention is on the PC edition and, of course, where to get it for the best price.

                              <span>My favourite genre of YouTuber is: &quot;person who hyperfixates on one mundane detail of a blockbuster video game and gets strangely poetic about it&quot;.  When you offer me a five-hour video essay about an obscure adventure game from 1998, I will hide in the closet. But if you idly wonder where the rivers in Skyrim go, I will follow along dutifully like a baby elephant. This is how I ended up spending much of my afternoon watching David Cage characters pissing. One video creator decided to painstakingly count every instance of playable pee time in cinematic adventure game Heavy Rain. This is vital work. This is important work.

                              <span>A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.
Yet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.

I don&#x27;t make the rules, that&#x27;s just how Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very JRPG world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad &quot;paintress&quot; who&#x27;s magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We&#x27;ve been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It&#x27;s too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you&#x27;ll make it.

Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don&#x27;t Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.


It&#x27;s out in early access today. Yes, they&#x27;ve sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

                              <span>Good news for anyone eager to meet a big talking catfish. A new trailer for action adventure game South Of Midnight sees players battering monsters from the folklore of the US&#x27; Deep South. It shows hero Hazel arguing with her mum before a supernatural hurricane cuts off the family drama and sends Hazel wandering the swamps to encounter giant alligators, giant fish, giant dolls, and giant people. Maybe Hazel is just very small. Either way, it also dangles an important morsel in front of our snapping jaws: a release date. Come see.

It&#x27;s out right now on Steam and Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass service. I&#x27;d say it has materialised from the darkness like a ninja, but there are a lot of ninjas in circulation at the minute, and my analogy-jitsu gauge is running dry. So instead, I&#x27;m going to say that it has materialised from the darkness like a resurfacing duck, its beak stuffed with pond vegetation. The pond vegetation, here, stands for &quot;tweaks to the weapons upgrade system&quot;. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

I get all excited about sharing details from a preview event for upcoming FPS Doom: The Dark Ages, then it turns out the gameplay reveal video is going public before the embargo anyway. Then the alleged release date allegedly leaks, allegedly. How am I supposed to present myself as a font of knowledge now, Id? Fortunately, we had a roundtable interview afterward with executive producer Marty Stratton and game director Hugo Martin. Sweet, job-justifying details!
Writing up the interview in full would involve typing out the words &quot;awesome&quot;, &quot;slaughter&quot;, &quot;core pillars&quot;, and &quot;iPod&quot; more times than anyone realistically needs to read. Instead, here&#x27;s a list of every detail I found interesting that isn&#x27;t already covered in the showcase.

                              <span>We called Amplitude&#x27;s fiendish and fanciful strategy game Endless Legend the best 4X of 2014, and its hexcellence hasn&#x27;t dimmed with age. &quot;The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly,&quot; breathed a reverential Ollie in 2023. &quot;It&#x27;s a simply splendid game.&quot; Like somebody commenting on the sturdiness of an original Picasso&#x27;s frame, I will only add that it now runs pretty comfortably on the current least expensive Dell Thinkpad.
Why in Meier&#x27;s name would Sega choose to sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder? The answer is lost in time (it&#x27;s through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they&#x27;ve just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher. Here&#x27;s the announcement trailer.

                              <span>Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou &quot;message&quot; než &quot;když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš&quot;? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

                              <span>Z &quot;Párty Hárd&quot; jsem byl nadšen, ale tohle jako kdyby natočil (a především napsal) někdo úplně jiný. Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen &quot;věci na jistotu&quot; jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)</span>
