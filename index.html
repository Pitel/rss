                              <span>Looks like there might be an MMO on the Horizon
The Horizon games have been one of the most well-loved series of recent memory, and for good reason -- the phrase &quot;robot dinosaurs&quot; alone should be enough to get even the most stubborn curmudgeons on board. While the mainline games have been of the third-person open world stealth/action varieties, now it looks like Guerilla is looking to diversify the franchise by way of an MMO set in the Horizon universe.
As per a news story from a South Korean outlet called MTN (and relayed by GamesRadar, Sony has partnered with a studio called NCSoft, best known for their title Guild Wars.

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: It&#x27;s been quite the year of disappointing video games. From CrossfireX to Babylon&#x27;s Fall, in tonight&#x27;s opening topic we discuss the worst games of the year. The crew also discusses the recent Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks and Square Enix&#x27;s major NFT blunder. All of that and so much more on Spot Dodge!
Video game development cycles are getting longer. The days of receiving three Uncharted games in the span of five years are over.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it&#x27;s both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

                              <span>If your favourite PC games are competitive shooters, then a high refresh rate monitor is an essential upgrade in my eyes - the reduced input lag and improved visual clarity makes a huge difference in games like Counter-Strike, Valorant, Fortnite and Call of Duty. 144Hz and 165Hz monitors used to be the norm, but now even faster monitors are becoming quite affordable - including this 280Hz Acer monitor that&#x27;s dropped to £180 at Laptops Direct, down from an original price of £275.

                              <span>Rhythm games lose something when they don’t come bundled with a peripheral, I think. There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

                              <span>Speedrunning charity event Awesome Games Done Quick is returning in January, and there’s plenty of PC runs among its freshly announced preliminary schedule. Notable standouts this time around are PowerWash Simulator, which might well be my personal GOTY contender, and a bonus appearance from cutesy cyberpunk cat sim Stray. There’s also a Google Stadia run of nautical indie action-adventure Wavetale, just a week before the streaming platform closes for good.

                              <span>The other week I played a short demo for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game&#x27;s special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

                              <span>Blacktail is a complicated, first-person adventure when you play a lil witch. Well, a witch in training, sort of. A witcheen. Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It&#x27;s a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you&#x27;re dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you&#x27;re an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don&#x27;t think that will change.

Netflix say they’re working together with The Coalition on producing both the movie and animation.

                              <span>Activision have not-so-clarified that next year’s annual Call Of Duty release will be a “full premium” one. The shotgun blast of marketing speak erupted from the company’s third quarter earnings results for the year, setting off car alarms, shattering glass, and triggering journalists’ Google Alerts. You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

                              <span>How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they&#x27;ve passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children&#x27;s pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

You probably also noticed that BioWare shared some concept art of an in-construction mass relay from the next Mass Effect game, along with a snippet of jumbled audio for people to download. Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

Popeye was the best thing to ever happen to spinach, and all it had to do was imply that eating a can would let you punch a train. Why did no other vegetable consider this? Children and adults alike would love to be just like their favorite village brawler. Why do processed meat sticks get the Macho Man’s elbow drop of approval but not bok choy?
We should really see more advergames. Let me tell you, I hate advertising. Seeing it in video game form, on the other hand, really lets you appreciate how insipid it is. Cool Spot had nothing to do with 7up, and McDonald’s Treasureland Adventure didn’t have a hamburger in sight. UFO Kamen Yakisoban has it right. It is all about a buckwheat-fueled tokusatsu hero getting all noodly with his prey. Yes!

Skyrim is one of the best-selling games of all time, and for good reason -- its expansive map, detailed cities, and compelling questlines make for some of the most immersive, fantasy-themed gaming you&#x27;re gonna get. Skyrim also has a robust modding community, so though aspects of the game might be dated now, you can make some changes to get your gaming experience to your exact specifications. If even that isn&#x27;t enough to keep your Skyrim playthroughs feeling fresh, then maybe it&#x27;s time to move onto something new. Thankfully, there are plenty of games out there that are perfectly-suited to fill the Skyrim-shaped hole in your heart.

As part of its newly published financial details, Nintendo has announced that it is entering into a joint venture with mobile gaming company DeNA. In a statement that, frankly, reads like it was written by an algorithm, Nintendo announced that it hopes to both expand user communication and improve upon all the services delivered by the &quot;Nintendo Account&quot; system.
&quot;With the integrated hardware-software model at the core of its business, Nintendo also strives to provide enhanced experience and service outside of its dedicated gaming system,&quot; begins perhaps the most buzzword statement in existence. &quot;In order to provide this experience in a holistic manner, Nintendo is working to maintain and expand its relationship with consumers primarily through Nintendo Account. Based on the expertise accumulated over the seven-plus years and the experience of co-developing multiple services based on Nintendo Account, Nintendo and DeNA will advance their partnership and establish a joint venture company.&quot;
&quot;With the objective to strengthen the digitalization of Nintendo’s business, the joint venture company will research and develop, as well as create value-added services to further reinforce Nintendo’s relationship with consumers.&quot;
This is not Nintendo&#x27;s first dealings with DeNA, the latter having been closely involved with multiple Nintendo mobile games, including Fire Emblem Heroes, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Super Mario Run, and Mario Kart Tour. DeNA is, in particular, responsible for the integration of player accounts and in-game communications. As partners, the two companies hope to research and develop more advanced technology and software for future Nintendo mobile titles and/or applications.

So Sonic Frontiers is out today, and there&#x27;s a lot little nuances that don&#x27;t matter (especially with the variety of combat abilities), and there&#x27;s some that do. Making sure that you remember that the Light Speed Dash ability even exists can be huge in terms of minute-to-minute Frontiers play.
Unlike a heap of powers in Sonic Frontiers, that need to either be unlocked via the skill tree or story progression, you can Light Speed Dash immediately. All you need to do is press the left analog stick in when you&#x27;re near a trail of rings, and Sonic will instant micro-dash (without a boost meter requirement) toward said ring formation. You can use the Light Speed Dash to get some extra air when Sonic is falling, collect a lot of rings quickly during a fight, or solve some puzzles.
I literally played hours of the game not recalling that this technique existed. I even quickly an inadvertently did a load screen tutorial sequence with it, and still forgot about it for a bit! Given that it&#x27;s largely not needed to get around (double-jumping and a breezy R2/RT dash take care of that), it is easy to block out of your mind.
But like me, you&#x27;ll probably come across some situation where you&#x27;re falling and quickly remember: the Light Speed Dash exists.

Those currently swingin&#x27; mallets and tossing pies in the madcap world of MultiVersus will be given the opportunity to go for the brass ring real soon, as Player First Games has kicked off the first test period for the brawler&#x27;s long-awaited Ranked Mode.
As of 09:00 PT / 12:00 ET / 18:00 BST, players will be able to jump into the temporary Alpha, which will be offering up a full week of ranked play in order for the developer to test the ins and outs of the new system. Ranked Mode will see players&#x27; win/loss ratio count toward an overall leaderboard standing, a feature that much of the MultiVersus community has been asking for some time now. Of course, standard multiplayer battles will also remain available during the course of Ranked alpha and beyond.

WayForward is still showing out the upcoming roster of River City Girls 2 — We already know that Kunio, Riki, and Double Dragon&#x27;s Marian will be joining Kyoko &amp; Misako on their latest rampage through the thug-filled &#x27;berg, and now we can take a look at sixth scrapper Provie, rounding out our raucous roster.
If this cool-looking lass feels familiar, then you might have seen her kicking ass and taking names in Conatus Creative&#x27;s cult 2017 release River City Ransom: Underground, where she made a name for herself as a hip-hop lovin&#x27; pop &#x27;n&#x27; lockin&#x27; fighter — having combined her love of breakdancing with Brazilian martial art capoeira. Taking time out from her own vigilante squad, &quot;The Flock&quot;, Provie will be ably helping the River City Girls in their fist-flinging battle against the powerful Sabu crime family.

River City Girls 2 was first revealed way back in the summer of 2021, with the team at WayForward drip-feeding characters, features, and rad new &#x27;choons since the title&#x27;s initial reveal. While we are still yet to receive a western release date for the sequel&#x27;s launch, (it&#x27;s getting a little tight on that &quot;2022&quot; release date now). The sequel, though similar in design to the 2020 original, will feature several new features including simultaneous four-player co-op action, and a variety of stylishly designed new boss characters.
River City Girls 2 is in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.

Recent bullet-pumping sequel Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues to smash all-time series records, with the stunning revelation that Activision&#x27;s latest military shooter has raked in a staggering $1 billion USD in revenue within its first 10 days of release.
This financial feat is just the latest in a series of records broken by Modern Warfare II, which is already the fastest-selling entry in the series to date and also broke the storied franchise&#x27;s milestone for Most Concurrent Steam Users, (with a peak of 263,174 players on launch night). The previous record to hit the Big Billion was held by the excellent 2012 entry Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, which hit the 10-digit mark in 15 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OeVapCrI1pY
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II continues the reboot/reboot storyline that began with 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The plot details a violent, globe-trotting campaign that sees Task Force 141, once again headed up by Captain Price, attempt to dismantle a dangerous arms cartel that threatens to bring death and destruction to the United States. In curious fashion, the game works as both a brand new title and a prequel to the previous Modern Warfare releases from the mid-&#x27;00s.
Following on from the relatively blah welcoming received by 2021&#x27;s Call of Duty Vanguard. Activision will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that, for now at any rate, the Call of Duty franchise remains untarnished from both a popularity and financial standpoint, with MWII&#x27;s success likely pointing to further years of entries in one of the industry&#x27;s most lucrative franchises.
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC (Steam/Battle.net), and Xbox.

                              <span>Nearing the end of 2022, Nintendo solidifies a few releases
Just recently, Nintendo finally dropped a Direct and dumped a ton of new info, remakes, and Nintendo 2023 first party release dates into our lap. Now, a new financial report for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 is backing up what we found out in September: with hopefully no delays in sight.
So there&#x27;s a few things to note here. Pikmin 4 is still just &quot;2023&quot; without a window in mind: which seems perfect for an E3 release date announcement for Q3 or Q4. Metroid Prime 4 (which is still a working title, or notated as &quot;temp&quot; in the financial report) is in the works and doesn&#x27;t even have a year in mind. Plus, Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp is &quot;TBA&quot; as of November 2022.
As far as other regions go, Europe seems to be on the same timeline as the US. Japan is welcoming Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which most of the world already has) on December 2, and the Re-Boot Camp &quot;TBA&quot; listing is completely missing. No doubt we&#x27;ll get more info and maybe even another Direct as we head into early 2023.
Nintendo&#x27;s 2023 first party Switch release dates:
Fire Emblem Engage - 1/20/2023
Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe - 2/24/2023
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - 5/12/2023
Pikmin 4 - 2023
Metroid Prime 4 - TBA
Advance Wars 1+2 Re-Boot Camp - TBA

Electronic Arts, in an internal statement acquired by GamesIndustry.biz, has announced that it is ending the Project CARS racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title Project CARS GO, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.
&quot;Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next Project CARS title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love.&quot;
&quot;We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition.&quot;

The Project CARS IP became the property of EA following the purchase of Codemasters and its subsidiaries, (including CARS developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here&#x27;s to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio&#x27;s staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.
There have been four Project CARS games in total, including Project CARS GO. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, Project CARS 3 was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.

                              <span>The Pokemon Twitter account: &quot;You won’t want to miss this&quot;
In what can only be described as a campaign of diminishing returns, The Pokemon Company has been advertising semi-regular morning videos for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet for some time now. They usually air at 9AM ET, and show off a variety of in-game shenanigans: both on the small and large ends of the content spectrum. Today is one of the former days.
Simply put, here is the hype message we got yesterday from the game&#x27;s official Twitter account: &quot;Calling all Trainers! A new #PokemonScarletViolet trailer arrives tomorrow! Tune in to our YouTube channel at 6:00 a.m. PT on 11/8 for the latest news! Don’t forget to subscribe and turn on notifications—you won’t want to miss this.&quot; And the thing you want want to miss? An Ed Sheeran AMV (anime music video) with Scarlet and Violet footage. That&#x27;s literally it.
Set to the tune of the Ed Sheeran song &quot;Celestial&quot; (which debuted at the end of September), the new video embedded below is basically just a standard trailer, complete with things we&#x27;ve seen before. Exploration, the three core storylines, the legendary mount Pokemon, and terastallizing (the new change mechanic) are all on display.
We&#x27;re clearly in the home stretch here!

                              <span>Pokemon Legends: Arceus leads the charge
Nintendo has released its latest financial earnings report, revealing that its Nintendo Switch hardware, now approaching its sixth year of release, continues to perform magnificently for the iconic publisher.
Nintendo has sold a grand total of 114.33 million Switch units worldwide since the console&#x27;s release in the spring of 2017, with 3.25 million units shifting in the most recent financial quarter. Of course, what is a console without software? And Nintendo is also sitting pretty in that department, with 64 million game sales taking place over the past three months, taking the grand total of Switch game sales to an incredible 917.59 million.

                              <span>How to Get the SA2 Shoes DLC
Sonic Frontiers DLC is already available in some form before its November 8 release date: by way of a Soap shoes-esque cosmetic add-on through the game&#x27;s official site. You might recognize them from Sonic Adventures 2!
Here&#x27;s the full details from Sega:
&quot;Sign up by January 31, 2023 and get in-game content exclusively available to our newsletter subscribers*! Simply enter your details and we&#x27;ll email a code straight to your inbox after Sonic Frontiers has been released on November 8, 2022. We’ll send more details about the in-game content and how to redeem your code to download the in-game content at a later date.* Available in selected regions for a limited time only. Sonic Frontiers game (sold separately) necessary to access in-game content. Gaming device must be connected to the internet to download in-game content.&quot;

If you want the SA2 shoes, you can go to the bottom of the official site here, and click &quot;subscribe to the newsletter.&quot; From there it&#x27;ll ask you to enter your email, date of birth, country, and what platform you&#x27;d like to get the in-game DLC on (which includes Switch, PC [Epic/Steam], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S).
While we still don&#x27;t have any major details on how equipment will work (or the &quot;Blue Seeds of Defense/Red Seeds of Power&quot; bonuses from the pre-order incentive), it seems like it&#x27;ll be a self-explanatory transmog system. The same goes for the Blue Seeds of Defense and Red Seeds of Power, which will likely boost Sonic&#x27;s resilience and attack damage respectively.
[Update: With the game launching this week, we figured it was good to get a reminder up! You can still sign up for the shoe DLC, it&#x27;ll just roll out &quot;24-48 hours&quot; after signing up, according to the site.]

As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

Today marks exactly ten years since Animal Crossing: New Leaf was first released on 3DS. Outside Japan, we had to wait until June the following year to become mayor in our autostereoscopic 3D hamlets, although its Switch counterpart, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, would be the first game in the main series to get a simultaneous worldwide release.
Recency bias is something all gamers will be familiar with, and something reviewers take into account before waxing lyrical over a series entry that, with time, may not be quite as exciting as when it was the new hotness. Throw in nostalgia for the one you played first and things get even more confused.

In amongst the wave of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet announcements that we have come across today, Pokémon Unite has revealed that it will be host to a special collaboration with the latest entry in the franchise which includes in-game fashion items, backgrounds, stickers and more.
According to Serebii.net, this collaboration will take place in two different &#x27;waves&#x27; (or three if you don&#x27;t have the game - don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll explain). The first items will be made available from Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s launch date on 18th November, 2022, where players can log into Unite and receive backgrounds, frames and in-game stickers based on the series&#x27; newest starters: Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly. Each of these items will be available until 1st February, 2023.

If you&#x27;re a fan of 16-bit RPGs in the Chrono Trigger mould, you&#x27;ve probably been keeping an eye on Matthias Linda&#x27;s upcoming Chained Echoes, a gorgeous-looking homage to that style of top-down RPG experience. Set in a world of mechs and dragons, it&#x27;s been on our radars for a while, and it&#x27;s finally got a release date: 8th December.
A new release date announcement trailer (above) shows off some of the characters, locales, and gameplay from the upcoming game, a one-man project which has been in development for the past seven years.

You might have heard of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. That cute little life sim which came out at the prime time of the global pandemic had us all picking weeds, catching fish and paying bills (extortionately priced, we might add) when we weren&#x27;t able to be outside picking weeds, catching fish or payi- wait, we still had to do that one.
Well, it&#x27;s that very game which has today overtaken Pokémon Red and Blue in Japan to become the country&#x27;s best-selling game of all time.

Today has been quite the day for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet news - then again, we can&#x27;t remember the last day that we didn&#x27;t find out something new about the game. Aside from releasing a new trailer which gave us a look at two new &#x27;mon, the game&#x27;s official site has been rife with news drops, detailing the first opponents in Tera Raid Battles and now giving us some information on how to unlock some sweet in-game merch for our Rotom Phones.
The merch of which we speak is a series of in-game phone cases which can be selected to keep your Rotom looking fresh as you explore the Paldea region. The best part is that they will be really easy to redeem (so long as you have played a Pokémon game on your Switch before).

Today (finally) marks the release of Sonic Frontiers, and with a host of mixed-to-positive reviews to its name, we were excited to see how the Switch version of the game would match up to the more powerful consoles. Fortunately, GameXplain has come through with a side-by-side graphics comparison and the results are, well, as expected.
While the Switch was always going to seem a little more washed-out when compared to its next-gen counterpart - the Nintendo version has a max resolution of 720p and framerate of 30FPS - the comparison demonstrates just how big of a difference this reduction makes.

We received yet another trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet today. While on the surface it may have appeared to be nothing more than an elaborate music video for Ed Sheeran&#x27;s newest track, &#x27;Celestial,&#x27; it appears that there was more information bubbling away under the surface than initially met the eye.
Apart from teasing the presence of two new Pokémon, the trailer also provided a closer look at Tera Raid Battles. Now, with the help of the game&#x27;s official site, The Pokémon Company has confirmed the first Terastalised &#x27;mon who will be up for the catch when the game releases on 18th November.

The latest Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet trailer has just dropped, and it&#x27;s definitely a celebratory one. Featuring Ed Sheeran&#x27;s brand new song, Celestial, and showcasing multiple Pokémon, places, and people we&#x27;ve already meant, it feels like we&#x27;re finally in the home stretch.
There weren&#x27;t a ton of new details here, except The Pokémon Company and Game Freak managed to say something with not very much. At around the 2:30 mark, we get a shot of Arven and your Pokémon trainer looking at a rather elaborate sketch of what looks to be a Donphan, the evolution of Phanpy. Though it&#x27;s looking a little different. The trailer then cuts to a close-up of what looks to be a hulking Pokémon, closely matching the sketch.

                              <span>Yes, it has a hallway scene.
Sifu launched this past February on PlayStation and PC and quickly built up a passionate core following due to its hard-hitting action and interesting core &#x27;ageing&#x27; mechanic. Now, nine months later, Sloclap’s martial arts brawler has arrived on the Switch with a solid port that doesn’t sacrifice anything that made the original release so great.
You begin the game infiltrating a rain-soaked temple, battering the students found inside, eventually joining with allies as you make your way further into the building. After you reach the top, it’s revealed you are Yang, who battles the sifu of the temple and kills him as his child watches from a cupboard. This child is subsequently killed by one of Yang’s associates. However, a medallion in the child&#x27;s hand brings them back to life. Hereafter referred to as ‘Hero’, the child is the protagonist of the game, who — after turning 20 years old — seeks revenge.

We have been excited to see Nintendo&#x27;s growth this morning as the company published its financial report for Q2 of the fiscal year ending March, 2023. One stat that has really stood out to us comes in the continued popularity of digital sales, with this mode of buying now accounting for 49.3% of all software sales in the quarter.
This marks a slight drop in the percentage from the year&#x27;s Q1 findings (for which digital accounted for 53% of sales) though digital purchases are still up on those seen in the last fiscal year, with this year&#x27;s overall digital sales currently sitting at 51% of the total while this time last year saw them at 45.1%.

Nintendo confirmed that Kirby and the Forgotten Land, launched back on March 25th, sold an impressive 2.61 million units during the period of April to September 2022, bringing the game&#x27;s total sales to 5.27 million.

This is an impressive number, yes, but it gets even more so when you consider the fact that these numbers only account for up to 30th September, 2022. With Splatoon 3 releasing on the 9th, this means that it made this much ground in only 21 days!

As part of Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial report detailing performance for Q2 of fiscal year ending March 2023, the company has confirmed that the Nintendo Switch has now sold a gargantuan 114.33 million units.
Once again, however, Nintendo states that sales have declined year-on-year thanks to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. This time, sales have decreased by 19.2%, totalling 6.68 million units, however the company reassures that demand for the console remains stable, with big hitting games like Splatoon 3 providing a healthy boost.

NIntendo has released its six months earnings reports for fiscal year ending March 2023 and, as per the norm, we&#x27;ve got an update on the top ten best-selling Nintendo Switch games.
There&#x27;s no major change from the last update back in August, but one noteable exception is Ring Fit Adventure. Selling a total of 14.87 million units, the fitness game has overtaken Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu / Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go Eevee, which itself sold a total of 14.81 million units.

Dead Cells is one of the most renowned indie games of the past few years, and it&#x27;s part of a larger wave of really awesome roguelike games we&#x27;ve seen. Now, as yet another homage to beloved indie games, a free Dead Cells update is available that includes in-game goodies inspired by titles like Terraria, Hotline Miami, Shovel Knight, Slay the Spire, Risk of Rain 2, and Katana Zero. It&#x27;s known as Everyone Is Here Vol. II, and the update includes new lore rooms based on the featured games, in which players will find related weapons and armor they can use in their next Dead Cells run.
The theming doesn&#x27;t just stop at being able to wear costumes or don weapons from those games -- the effects and animations for actions like attacking…</span>

Zombie Hunter looks like a fake game. You know the opening of No More Heroes III where Travis Touchdown outlines this weird Deathman game, and the gamer part of your brain tells you that such a game couldn’t exist in the time period it’s supposedly from? That’s Zombie Hunter. It tells me it’s from 1987, but doesn’t really tell me it was developed by Lenar. Instead, it just mentions Hi-Score Media Work Corp, which was sued out of existence by Enix over a screenshot of Dragon Quest 2. I know this, because the first thing the game does upon being started is scream at you, “Hai Sukoa!” It was a nice jumpscare to start the game.

That&#x27;s a lot of UI
Just look at it. Half of the screen in Zombie Hunter is taken up by its HUD. It’s excessive! Then you actually start mo…</span>

As the Ghostrunner community eagerly awaits news of the cyberpunk hack &#x27;n&#x27; slasher&#x27;s upcoming sequel, publisher 505 Games has decided to throw them a bone in the form of some Ghostrunner 2 concept art — depicting the hi-tech towers awaiting Jack&#x27;s next bout of high-speed slice &#x27;n&#x27; dice action.
The new art was revealed as part of a special live stream this weekend, which you can watch right here.

Currently in development at Polish studio One More Level, Ghostrunner 2 was first announced way back in May 2021, though very little has been revealed of the project to date — with plot details, locales, and mechanics still under wraps. One can only assume that the developer will stick with what brought it to the dance, offering highly adrenalized action, wanton violence, and…</span>

This weekend saw the official reveal of the next hero headed to Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s shooter sequel Overwatch 2, but while the incoming Omnic Ramattra might have taken some of the community by surprise, (given the persisting rumor that Mauga would be next), some die-hard fans are sat with itchy trigger fingers waiting on the arrival of the mysterious mech maiden, D.Mon.
D.Mon, as OW lore fans will realize, is a member of South Korea&#x27;s Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army — more commonly known by the acronym &quot;MEKA&quot;. The MEKA is a party of highly skilled operatives who assist the government with various tasks, ranging from global defense to search-and-rescue operations. Encased in finely tuned, state-of-the-art mech units, MEKA are single-person assault vehicles, …</span>

                              <span>&quot;We’ve noticed a notable number of PS5 players playing the PS4 version of Destiny 2 on their current-generation consoles&quot;
When the current generation rolled out, Microsoft touted a concept called &quot;Smart Delivery.&quot; While some laughed at the idea of rolling out the red carpet for something that seems so obvious, Sony figured out a way to make version parity more confusing. Now developers, Bungie included, are stepping in to make sure that PlayStation players specifically are playing the right version of Destiny 2.
Over on their weekly blog, Bungie provided the following statement for PS5 owners:
&quot;Heads up, PlayStation Guardians. We’ve noticed a notable number of PS5 players playing the PS4 version of Destiny 2 on their current-generation consoles. For the optimal experience for PlayStation goodness, make sure to check out this resource here to upgrade to the free PS5 version to see an improvement in framerates and graphics overall.&quot;

That resource actually goes straight to a Sony FAQ page, which explains the difference between selecting the &quot;PS4 version&quot; and &quot;PS5 version&quot; of games that ostensibly have cross-generational delivery. If you haven&#x27;t done it before, it involves going to the game hub for an individual title, then checking to see if you have the upgrade license available, then downloading that version entirely.
It&#x27;s a shame that this is where we&#x27;re at nearly two years after the launch of the PS5 (the anniversary is happening this week!), but it is what it is. The tools to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen to you are out there!

                              <span>Dive into the Upside Down
Netflix Games, in association with developer Tender Claws, has announced that it will be adapting its hugely popular horror series, Stranger Things, for the VR platform. According to the publisher Stranger Things VR will launch in the winter of 2023 for all &quot;major VR platforms&quot;.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wQnFM5X5XQM
Perhaps surprisingly, players will actually take up the role of Vecna — the antagonist of the show&#x27;s fourth season — as they attempt to wreak havoc and vengeance on both the town of Hawkins and, in particular, its powerful psychic savior, Eleven. Stranger Things VR will see Vecna, (and by proxy, the player) invade multiple worlds, conjure up terrifying and vivid nightmares, and engage in reality-shattering psychological warfare.
In many ways, Stranger Things is custom designed for virtual reality, given its &quot;no rules&quot; approach to the simple act of physical existence. While VR, for many, remains little more than a somewhat interactable rollercoaster ride/ghost train, it is a medium that perfectly suits franchises that focus on the strange, the bizarre, and the warped. And, as such, fans of The Upside Down and its occupants would likely have a real thrill ride exploring its mind-bending themes and aesthetic in fully immersive 3D action.

                              <span>It&#x27;s running through November 9
A new My Nintendo Rabbids promotion is afoot, and it&#x27;s currently live now through November 9, 2022 at 2AM ET.
As a bid to promote Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope (which is out later this month), it&#x27;ll involve several figurines/plush toys, as well as more traditional collector&#x27;s edition swag like lithographs and an art book. It&#x27;ll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
Here is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:
Rabbid Mario Figurine
Rabbid Peach Figurine
Set of 3 lithographs
Spark Plush
Artbook
Spark Phone Ring Holder
Stickers Sheet
[Update: Here&#x27;s a reminder that the contest ends on November 9 at 2AM ET. Effectively, unless you&#x27;re a night owl, you have until tomorrow evening in most regions to put your Platinum Points up.]

Supermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of The Devil in Me, the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, The Dark Pictures. Publisher Bandai Namco released a new trailer, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator&#x27;s world.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the &quot;The Murder Castle&quot; — the opulent estate of America&#x27;s first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;VUcFLkAZmyo
The trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all The Dark Pictures titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most &quot;slasher&quot; based, perhaps eschewing the supernatural and/or monster-based terror of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a Shining-esque bar and a Tourist Trap range of animatronics, to Saw-style &quot;death traps&quot; and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.
The Devil in Me will represent the culmination of The Dark Pictures&#x27; first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of previously trademarked titles, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Roaming Gimmighouls are in Go early, too
Pokemon Go and Scarlet/Violet connectivity is confirmed by way of a tweet from the official Pokemon Twitter account, which asks players to &quot;stay by for future announcements.&quot;
Interestingly, a new Pokemon has been shown off as a result of this collaboration. It&#x27;s called &quot;Gimmighoul,&quot; and follows a long line of mythological tricksters that are focused around coins/gold/wealth.  Gimmighoul takes on a &quot;chest form&quot; in Scarlet and Violet, and functions a lot like a Mimic treasure chest in many other forms of fantasy media. But it also sports a &quot;roaming form,&quot; which is live in Pokemon Go now.
Here&#x27;s a breakdown:
&quot;Research conducted by Professor Willow and Jacq, a biology teacher from the Paldea region, confirms that Trainers have spotted Gimmighoul in its Roaming Form. Further, there’s another form in the Paldea region called Chest Form Gimmighoul.&quot;

We also get a reconfirmation that Pokemon Home support is still planned for Scarlet and Violet after launch. Right at 5:01 in the below video at the bottom of the screen, you&#x27;ll see that Scarlet/Violet connectivity &quot;is expected to be added to Pokemon Home after the game&#x27;s release.&quot; Future announcements will come at a later date.
While Pokemon connectivity is often rolled out haphazardly or late, it&#x27;s nice to know that it&#x27;s coming at some point.

                              <span>The Devil&#x27;s in the Details
As Blizzard Entertainment continues beavering away at its upcoming sequel Diablo IV, the rumor mills have started churning out potential dates for the eventual return of one of gaming&#x27;s grimmest and most uniquely compelling dungeon crawlers. We have already been told the title will be &quot;playable&quot; in 2023, though when and in what form remains a mystery.
Enter frequent spoiler XboxEra podcast, as hosted by Windows Central. In the most recent episode of the show, it was suggested that Blizzard could be planning on launching the sequel as soon as April of next year, with pre-orders opening in December, perhaps following a brand new trailer at the upcoming Game Awards show, which is currently scheduled to take place exactly one month from now. Pre-orders are expected to include standard editions alongside Blizzard&#x27;s typical premium collector&#x27;s set.

Of course, this is mostly hearsay (or should that be &quot;heresy&quot;?) for now, but the XboxEra podcast has been pretty much on the money when it comes to the revelation of upcoming projects and release dates. We already know that Diablo IV is in a very playable form, as private betas have been circling among staff and colleagues for some time now (complete with oodles of leaked footage). Sping 2023 still seems a little early, but if Overwatch 2 has taught us anything, Blizzard is not the &quot;ready when it&#x27;s ready&quot; company it once was, and is seemingly far more interested in getting products out in customers&#x27; hands ASAP.
Diablo IV is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Ebay&#x27;s TAKEIT10 code offers a 10% discount on a wide range of PC components and peripherals, but I was tickled by this deal on an Integral 480GB SSD, which brings this sizeable drive down to just £24. 
That&#x27;s a solid £5 below the price of the same drive on Amazon, and well into bargain buy territory for anyone that wants to cheaply and easily add more storage to their desktop or laptop. If you have any old laptops that are still running on hard drives, for example, then this could be an awesome low-cost upgrade!

This little gadget has a simple premise: fifteen customisable keys, each with a little LCD screen behind it, that can be bound to accomplish a wide range of things from scene switching in OBS and monitoring your computer&#x27;s vitals to launching programs or muting your microphone. Normally the Stream Deck costs £150, but today it&#x27;s down to £90 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Compared to many of the latest FPS offerings out there, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fossil. It&#x27;s such a simplistic looking game, right? A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it&#x27;s more refined than basically any of its competitors.

                              <span>I, like many people I know these days, will only watch a YouTube video if it&#x27;s either less than 5 minutes or more than an hour long. YouTube evolved a while ago into a platform for long-form video essays, and I for one am happy about it. Even better: Jenny Nicholson just released an almost four hour video on an uncompleted attraction in Utah called Evermore. Evermore is a sort of theme park-slash-immersive-theatre that appears to have been beset both by uncontrollable world events and bad management, but I still want to go because it looks pretty fun(ny). 
I did think about what games I would like to become immersive experience theme parks in this kind of vein, though, and I gotta say... I&#x27;m coming up empty.

                              <span>Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer - not including Warzone 2.0 - brings out the best of COD&#x27;s excellent gunplay on an array of colourful maps that largely deliver. And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn&#x27;t make it an athletics competition.
And while the game&#x27;s multiplayer is a slick refinement of what&#x27;s come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve got the game installed on an SSD...

                              <span>Black Friday can always be relied upon to take the pain out of a new keyboard purchase. I’ve only been keeping track in a very general sense but it does feel like non-sale prices, especially on mechanical keyboards, have been creeping upwards. If you are in the market, you could thefore find, say, a list of the best early Black Friday gaming keyboard deals very useful indeed. Hey, here&#x27;s one.

That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023. Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.

                              <span>There’s a war going on between instalments in the Battlefield series, and it looks like Battlefield 1 is coming out on top for now. The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it&#x27;s since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

Windows Central and the XboxEra podcast both say they’ve heard the release window from sources. That’s not all, as details of the fantasy action RPG’s release could be announced on December 8th at The Game Awards, according to both sets of sources. These include pre-orders opening during the show, and a February 2023 open beta.

Forget about other games for the moment though, because one developer’s bringing The Bible itself to Steam. The appropriately named Bible Games are releasing a fully voiced version of the good book on November 14th, complete with trivia quizzes to check your biblical knowledge. You can watch the surprisingly dramatic trailer below.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.
Game Informer: What happened in Scorn?

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …</span>

[Update: This article has been updated with new information revealed in the time since launch.]

He issued a call for testing and as a result was provided valuable feedback that led to some new fixes now on the way. But there still is more work ahead and he&#x27;s requested further testing by Linux laptop users to ensure the reworked backlight handling is in good shape...</span>

                              <span>Trápí Vás, že multimetry s digitálním výstupem naměřených hodnot jsou tak drahé? Že si snadno nemůžete nalogovat nabíjení svých solárních baterií? Bastlíře z projektu MacGyver SiliconHill také a proto na internetu vyšmejdili způsob, jak dostávat naměřená data z levného multimetru z běžného nákupního řetězce. Pokud se chcete také dozvědět jak na to, dorazte na Virtuální Bastlírnu – virtuální setkání (nejen) ajťáků, bastlířů, elektroniků, fyziků.

Bastlíři z křemíkového kopce pro vás ještě našli jak používat SMD rezistory velikost 2512 místo tenzometrů, že KiCAD ve verzi 7.0 bude podporovat knihovny v externích SQL databázích a že na poslední verzi macOS Ventura dojde k rozbití podpory RP2040. A mnoho dalšího.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte. Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 7. listopadu od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>A decade later, the fire still burns
Little Inferno is a name you might not have heard in quite a while. The indie project about burning things for fun and profit is back in 2022, with the Little Inferno Ho Ho Ho Holiday Expansion.
Arriving on November 18, Little Inferno is ringing in the festive season with plenty of kindling. Nutcrackers, reindeer, jelly beans, and more are all ripe for the flame.

It&#x27;s a pretty sizeable expansion, with an entirely new story and a new character. Plenty of holiday products await your flame, and there are over 50 new combos to discover. Or you can just get the infinitely burning Yule Log and have yourself a relaxing, cozy night by the TV light.
All I want for Christmas is fuel
Little Inferno first lit a spark back in 2012, becoming a bit of a sensation in an ever-growing indie scene. Developer Tomorrow Corporation has gone on to make some fun puzzle games, like Human Resource Machine and 7 Billion Humans.
But something about the discoverability and mystery of Little Inferno still feels all its own. While it&#x27;s made it to new consoles in the time since its debut, seeing a new DLC drop for it this many years later is pretty exciting.
So if you want to ring in the new year with a little fuel and a little fire, Little Inferno is back with more reasons to celebrate the season. It&#x27;s up for wishlisting on Steam, Epic, and GOG, and is headed to Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android sometime soon.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s premium broadcasters use conditional access systems to restrict viewing to paying customers and prevent piracy. These systems are reportedly very good but that&#x27;s making Russia nervous. Western anti-piracy companies dominate the market and at least in theory, could black out TV sets all over the country. A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

One producer at Square Enix thinks helping gamers feel welcome by including non-binary pronouns is such a small ask that it was a no-brainer to have it be a part of his new game.

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you&#x27;re interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember now if it was Monster Prom or Dream Daddy that introduced me to the dating sim genre, but Monster Prom was definitely my first dating sim hybrid, a sub-genre I&#x27;m now more than a bit obsessed with. Other favourite examples of mine include last year&#x27;s Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet&#x27;s surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

                              <span>Horror series The Dark Pictures Anthology is drawing its first season to a close with the arrival of supernaturally bereft slasher The Devil In Me on November 18th, and a new trailer lets us meet all the cheerful faces we’ll undoubtedly see brutally murdered at some point. Handily, it’s made me realise that Paul Kaye – known for his Game Of Thrones role as resurrectionist Thoros of Myr, and for being mortally annoying as Dennis Pennis in the Nineties – is playing shock doc director Charlie. Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

                              <span>Players of 343 Industries’ futuristic open-world shooter Halo Infinite will be able to bask in the glow of ray traced graphics when the game’s season 3 arrives next year. The inclusion was announced at AMD’s recent, horrifically named AMD Presents:together we advance_gaming livestream, where the company showed off their latest Radeon RX graphics cards. Season 3 of Halo Infinite is expected to launch on March 7th, 2023.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I&#x27;ve now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn&#x27;t have any history with either game before now, but it&#x27;s become increasingly apparent that they&#x27;re effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They&#x27;re so similar, in fact, that it&#x27;s kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre&#x27;s release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn&#x27;t be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

                              <span>When Team Ninja&#x27;s Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: &quot;Wow, that looks like my sort of jam&quot;. A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I&#x27;d say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out for the full release.

They’re due to air tonight, November 4th, in the US, and in the early hours of tomorrow morning for people on the other side of the Atlantic. That leaves enough time to place your bets on who it’ll turn out to be.

                              <span>We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

Dean collaborated with Schachner on the score for the previous Modern Warfare game.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is morish. Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

This monitor costs £209 at Amazon UK right now, but it&#x27;s a solid £30 less at Currys when you use code FNDDGAMING at the checkout - neat.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5 5600X processor is the pick of the litter when it comes to value for money - perhaps excepting the slightly cheaper 5600 - and today it&#x27;s down to £170, a full £110 off its UK RRP. While Ryzen 7000 offers better performance, it also comes with steeper requirements - like DDR5 RAM, a 600-series motherboard and a much bigger budget. Here&#x27;s why we rate this particular CPU at this discounted price.

                              <span>“How do I play with you?” That’s the first thing my friend asked when I got him hooked on Marvel Snap. “You can’t,” I answered. But that won’t be the case for long. The developers behind the mega hit mobile card game say the ability to battle against friends will arrive within the next two months.

                              <span>Genshin Impact players have been inadvertently locking themselves out of the newest major story update, and they’re not happy. “Getting quest blocked while doing an archon quest is the new cockblock,” tweeted one player. One even stopped their gaming session after getting “c0ckblocked.” Frankly, they’re right.

In France, however, movie fans still have to wait more than a year before they can stream the latest blockbusters. The MPA flags this mandatory release window as a potential trade barrier, with the potential make piracy even worse.

While police, the Premier League, and FACT, used glowing terms to announce the &quot;successful&quot; prosecution, it&#x27;s unlikely to have met expectations, potentially due to a significant change in tactics.

                              <span>Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”</span>

Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with &quot;H&quot; and both their last names start with &quot;K.&quot; Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…</span>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…</span>

From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…</span>

                              <span>Santa Monica Studio has revealed the nine different graphics modes available for God of War Ragnarök across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

Favor Quality: 2160p (native 4K), 30 FPS target
Favor Quality + High Refresh Rate Display: 1800p - 2160p, 40 FPS target
Favor Quality + High Refresh Rate Display + Variable Refresh Rate: 1800p - 2160p, unlocked 40 FPS

As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that&#x27;s great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you&#x27;re in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

Back in June for Summer Game Fest, 15 games were given the showcase&#x27;s coveted spotlight, and now a couple of months on Tim Schfer and his crew have given another group of indies the attention they deserve. That’s a lot of games! It’s also the showcase’s 10th anniversary so let&#x27;s all pop our party poppers and jump right into the indie list.

                              <span>Rainy Season is a game that speaks to that universal feeling of having your plans scuppered by inclement weather. We&#x27;ve all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio&#x27;s hour-long narrative game, it&#x27;s a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he&#x27;s got to face a day stuck inside his grandma&#x27;s house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that melee combat’s a crucial part of Bethesda’s ageing but beloved fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Flailing wildly at enemies with a big sword, axe, or warhammer, jostling them about with your implement of doom like armour-clad sausages frying in a pan, never seems to get old. What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution. It’s a mace that’s, well, Mace.

We talk about the characters that we relate to most, and also I find a way to mention Saturnalia again. Tune in next week to see if I can keep up my streak!
Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable. For myself and Nate the themes include sadness and drudgery. But there&#x27;s good news, because Nate has remembered to make me a Cavern Of Lies this week! Hooray!

As you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve played either of Blizzard&#x27;s near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

                              <span>I don’t know about you, but I’m not very good at reading Ye Olde Ynglishe. The letters are all curly, and my vision’s already a bit rubbish to begin with. Like a lot of specialised fonts, I find calligraphy awkward to read at best and virtually illegible at worst. That’s why I always appreciate when games make an effort to make text as accessible as possible. Case in point: Obsidian’s upcoming medieval mystery, Pentiment, which has an option to swtich to easy to read fonts baked in. Verily, thou hast mine thanks.

                              <span>If our glowing Signalis review has you hungry for more retro-styled survival horror, do also check out the new demo for Heartworm. Inspired by classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, Heartworm is neat even before you learn it&#x27;s almost entirely made by one person. It offers good times exploring a spooky house, bad times possibly trapped inside a neighbourhood in a VHS tape, and a very cosy time hanging out in the safe room. It is a lovely safe room.

                              <span>Only last week I was praising games that wanna be weird, and as such I must commend the weirdness of The Chant, a third-person action adventure where a retreat akin to Jared Leto&#x27;s definitely-not-a-cult finds itself crashing into a weird nightmare realm akin to the Upside Down from Stranger Things. The thing is, if anything I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s weird enough. If you&#x27;re going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

Now though, a new trailer gives a proper glimpse of what Holmes and Watson will be getting up to when they take on H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, once again for the very first time. Have a watch below, and try not to get lost in an ethereal netherworld inhabited by malevolent, sleeping gods.

It’s not exactly a replacement for the Google Stadia streaming service that’s shutting down in January, but if you play a lot of Android games on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook then at least it’s an option.

The window for ranked play’s arrival was tweeted by Treyarch alongside some more things to expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, such as competitive modes, a Top 250 leaderboard, and visible skill ratings.

                              <span>Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that&#x27;s always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It&#x27;s a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland&#x27;s Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you&#x27;ll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you&#x27;re here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo&#x27;s Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry&#x27;s nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you&#x27;d hope.

                              <span>When it comes to DDR4 RAM, the market has decided that 3200MT/s CL16 is the perfect spec: noticeably faster than early DDR4-2133, 2400 and 2666, while being significantly cheaper than higher-end 3400, 3600 and 4000 kits. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

I adore my collections of GTA clown cars but it&#x27;s no match. This week, we must choose between two slightly wistful things, one that&#x27;s come and gone and one that&#x27;s confined to a single game. And, ah, I cannot deny having been influenced by last week&#x27;s vote for one of these options. What&#x27;s better: feelies, or RULES OF NATURE? Vote now!

Maybe too much. 2816.6 hours of Dota 2, according to Steam, and that doesn’t count the days I’ve spent flying out to watch more talented people play it in arenas. It’s easy to get lost in, is Dota, and not just in the bad ways – even after a series of crap matches, it’s so easy to sink further into its incredible depth, its neverending wizard fight nuances, that it could be hour number 2820 before coming back up for air.

                              <span>Without a doubt, Elden Ring has spent hours of this year floating around my mind, like a parasitic gargoyle making a nest out of my stringy brain matter. Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I&#x27;m still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I&#x27;d reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don&#x27;t get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

There’s loads of info about Nahida and her abilities in the trailer below, so watch away.

                              <span>Canadian studio and developers of sci-fantasy, turn-based tactics RPG Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, Complex Games, are joining UK-based publisher Frontier. Daemonhunters was released in May this year under the Frontier Foundry label, and we rather enjoyed it at the time. It seems as though, in the grand tradition of Remington shaver ads, Frontier liked the game so much that they bought the company.

                              <span>By far the best thing about the RTX 4090 – which is otherwise a bit of a GPU boondoggle – is that is supports DLSS 3. This next-gen version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler not only boosts performance with render resolution trickery but also adds entirely new, AI-generated frames of its own, smoothing out visuals even further. Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

                              <span>Developers Munfish have finally announced that its bonkers Soviet shooter Atomic Heart will release on February 21st, 2023. The new trailer for shooty alternate universe action RPG Atomic Heart is a bit of a trip, frankly. Barrelling along at the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, you can just about make out some weird looking Soviet robots, head-splitting mutants, and what seemed to be a truck plummeting towards towering futuristic architecture. Watch the eye-meltingly speedy trailer below, you’ll probably need some bugeye goggles afterwards to recuperate your peepers.

It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

The snippet of info that the new Deus Ex game is in the very, very early stages was reported by Bloomberg following yesterday’s revelation that sister studio Onoma is closing down. Eidos Montreal are also alleged to be working on a completely new game, as well as helping out with some co-development on some Microsoft-owned series, including the new Fable.

                              <span>As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it&#x27;s a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

                              <span>In January 2022, rightsholders began utilizing a new site-blocking law introduced by France, specifically targeted at live sports streaming piracy. In the following months, Internet providers were ordered to block hundreds of domain names. Positive results of the new legislation are already being reported and with Google taking action, the crackdown has serious momentum.

Original story: The Last of Us TV series will premiere in a little over two months if HBO&#x27;s page for the show is any indication. 
HBO Max subscribers began to notice that on the page for The Last of Us series on HBO, a description of the show says it premieres on January 15, as reported by Eurogamer. The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality&#x27;s Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can&#x27;t wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it&#x27;s hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we&#x27;ll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you&#x27;re interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer.

                              <span>Look, everyone needs a flash drive. These things used to be the new hotness, back before email and cloud storage made them a bit irrelevant, but it&#x27;s still jolly useful to have one on hand to install (or recover) an OS, play (legally) downloaded videos on your TV or just bring your presentation in without worrying about something going wrong. 
So: the SanDisk 32GB Ultra Flair flash drive is down to £5 on Amazon after a ~40% discount. If you&#x27;ve not got a good, fast USB drive, then why not pick this one up while it&#x27;s on sale?

                              <span>Wanna know something cool? You can pick up Intel&#x27;s cheapest 12th-gen Core processor for £105 after a discount at CCL, with the Core i3 12100F offering incredible performance for this kind of money. 
It&#x27;s able to outmatch some classic great value gaming CPUs, like the Ryzen 5 3600X and Core i5 11400F, and even comes close to the powerful (and more expensive) Core i5 11600K. All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

                              <span>Halloween might be over, but island farming sim Coral Island appears to have generated a doppelganger on social media that has a hankering for NFTs. Coral Island’s developers Stairway Games have brought attention to the scam account, which uses the real game’s logo and key art but adds an extra web3 cryptobro twist by linking itself to the GameFi blockchain gaming platform. Stairway, as you would, are calling shenanigans.

                              <span>I knew I was always going to love Slipways from the moment I first saw it. That&#x27;s a fairly rare thing for me. Enough games have failed to deliver on their promises over the years that I&#x27;ve learnt to be cautious for the most part. But I let my guard down with Slipways, because the premise was so simple. Simple, and beautiful.

The best early Black Friday gaming monitor deals are growing in number, so if you’ve been squinting at blurry, dark approximations of what you think might be your PC games, it&#x27;s prime time to look into discounted upgrades.

Starting with Season 2 on November 11th though, the international football competition is being represented in FUT with plenty of seasonal gubbins instead. The World Cup is, of course, also coming to the main game from November 9th in single-player and online Tournament mode. You can watch the FIFA 23 World Cup deep dive video below.

                              <span>Sometimes, I just want to wander around an aesthetically pleasing landscape with nice music doing menial tasks - and that’s exactly what I got from Paradise Marsh, a lovely little wildlife game from LazyEti. I’ve been playing some pretty intense games recently, throttling my game controller as I run away from literal waves of rats in A Plague Tale: Requiem and shifting my detective brain into overdrive grappling with the excellent mysteries in The Case of the Golden Idol.
I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain. Paradise Marsh has been the exact tonic I’ve needed, a chill bug-collectathon where you wander around pleasant, pastel landscapes discovering lots of fun little curiosities. It’s wonderful.

Unlike when Bastion was disabled because of his glitching ultimate, however, Mei does at least have a return date pencilled in. Blizzard are aiming to get her back in Overwatch 2 for November 15th, when the game’s next scheduled patch drops. That still might slip, though. What? I had to get an ice crack in.

                              <span>Just over a week ago, we launched a new introductory offer for the RPS supporter programme that chops the price of our monthly Standard tier down to just £1 / $1 for your first month. This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it&#x27;s clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we&#x27;re doing just that. 
For the month of November, we&#x27;ll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We&#x27;ve also made a bunch of Sin Vega&#x27;s indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we&#x27;ve got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we&#x27;re doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November. But wait... there&#x27;s more!

                              <span>Avast your behind, hen, for a new month means a new lineup of PC Game Pass games. Microsoft today laid out the comings and goings for the first half of November, headlined by Return To Monkey Island. The revival of the revered point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game series will hit Game Pass next week, and until then you can tide yourself over with modernistic adventures from more of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead. Read on for the rest of the games coming in the next fortnight, including some on their launch day, and those sadly leaving too.

                              <span>Mount &amp; Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad. In fact, it&#x27;s overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord&#x27;s design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what&#x27;s been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn&#x27;t meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click &quot;make charcoal&quot;, then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you&#x27;ll discard hundreds of them. You can&#x27;t do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone&#x27;s pommel.

The game’s also coming to Itch.io too. It will introduce pixel art graphics, tutorials, and new music and sound effects into the previously ASCII-only world of dwarven delving.

This was a futile endeavor from the start, the RIAA argues.

They say that billpayers are liable because they pirated content themselves or failed to stop someone else who did. When movie company Voltage Holdings tried to win default judgments against 30 internet subscribers, none of whom were shown to be the actual infringers, a judge refused to comply. In its appeal, Voltage says the judge made the wrong decision.

                              <span>According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn&#x27;t for Modern Warfare II&#x27;s cast of c…</span>

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

This news comes by way of a new interview between Spencer and the Same Brain YouTube channel, where Spencer said Activision Blizzard would keep releasing Call of Duty games on Sony consoles &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to,&quot; as reported by Eurogamer. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

                              <span>Netflix has announced that Henry Cavill&#x27;s final season as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher will be Season 3, with Liam Hemsworth picking the mantle for Season 4. 
This news comes as a surprise considering how devoted Cavill has seemed to the role over the years, quickly becoming a fan-favorite after the release of Season 1. He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth&#x27;s casting in the role. 
&quot;My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,&quot; Cavill&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

                              <span>Publishers and authors are not happy with Z-Library, an online repository offering millions of pirated books for free download. The site&#x27;s userbase is growing rapidly, in part helped by TikTok users&#x27; viral videos. Following a recent complaint from the Authors Guild, TikTok has banned the hashtag  #zlibrary pending further review. But will that help?

                              <span>During the 2012 operation to shut down Megaupload, 135 electronic devices were seized, mostly from founder Kim Dotcom. After the FBI cloned some of the devices and took them back to the U.S., a legal battle over the validity of the original search warrants and the devices ensued. More than a decade later, the matter appears to be over.

AGOS

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>A new study reveals how purchasing a Kodi-powered streaming box changed the Internet and media consumption habits of US households. The researchers use these boxes as a piracy proxy, as they were often loaded with third-party piracy apps. Interestingly, their data show that the use of these boxes led to increased legal consumption through on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube.

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.

                              <span>I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts. The app is named for the Snap mechanic, w…</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a &quot;soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover.&quot; Using these tiles, you can create a &quot;unique story-multiverse&quot; at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

                              <span>Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you&#x27;re looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!</span>
