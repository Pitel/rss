                              <span>It&#x27;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
It has certainly been a festive week this time around at Nintendo Life. We&#x27;ve been busy getting all things ready for the end of the year and are now ready to catch up on all of the great games that we have missed in the meantime.
The week brought us our Nintendo Switch Year in Review (always a reminder that we do, in fact, play surprisingly little) and we put together a list of our most-played games. We also asked you lovely lot for your favourite Switch games of the year, while we looked ahead and discussed our most-anticipated games for 2023 (that aren&#x27;t Zelda).

The Pokémon Company has announced Ash Ketchum will be hanging up his trainer cap after 25 years early next year. The news has surprised a lot of people around the world including the current voice of Ash, and now it seems the original voice of the character in the long-running anime series has also chimed in.
Taking to social media, Veronica Taylor couldn&#x27;t believe it herself, mentioning how it&#x27;s been an incredible journey for the character over the past 25 years. Here&#x27;s exactly what she had to say across a series of tweets:

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already hosted a number of distribution events, but this latest one is a bit different. As part of Jump Festa 2023 this weekend, The Pokémon Company is distributing a special Ground Tera Type Gyarados.
Unfortunately, the catch here is you&#x27;ll need to actually be located in Japan to access this limited-time offer. If you are eligible, all you need to do is participate in a demo Tera Raid Battle. You&#x27;ll then receive a serial code that can be used to redeem the Gyarados.

The Game Awards actually turned out to be a good show this time around, at least compared to previous years, and it seems the fans agree — Geoff Keighley announced via his Twitter that The Game Awards in 2022 &quot;hit a new viewership milestone&quot; of &quot;103 million livestreams,&quot; making it &quot;the most-watched Game Awards in history.&quot; Keighley goes on to detail some of the stats in the thread under his tweet, including that Twitter&#x27;s stream of the event was a hit this year with 11.5 million viewers, and that the Steam Deck giveaway drew 9.5 million viewers to the platform&#x27;s native stream, with a peak of over 850K concurrent viewers.
That&#x27;s a staggering number of people who tuned in, and I have my own theories as to what caused the numbers to skyrocket this ye…</span>

                              <span>A sizeable shake-up following Criterion&#x27;s latest game
Some changes are being made at Electronic Arts&#x27; Criterion Games, following its latest launch. Five long-time developers at the studio are leaving, just after Criterion launched Need For Speed Unbound.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Criterion GM and VP Matt Webster is leaving the studio after working at Criterion for more than two decades. Head of studio development Alan McDairmant and head of content Steve Uphill are also departing, as well as executive producer Pete Lake and senior technical director Andrei Shires.
All five put in a sizeable chunk of years at the company, and all are leaving to explore &quot;new opportunities outside of EA,&quot; via GIbiz.
David Rutter, the GM of EA&#x27;s racing group, has announced some shifts following these departures. Charity Joy from the EA Sports UFC team is joining as executive producer for Need For Speed, while Codemasters&#x27; Geoff Smith is moving over to take up a spot as senior director of product development. The two join head of studio operations Steve Cuss, who has stayed in his role.
&quot;As we look ahead, we know there’s a strong opportunity to evolve our games and experiences, and bring them to an even broader audience of fans–with our long-term strategy centered on our strengths in licensed motorsports as well as arcade/open-world racing,&quot; said Rutter in a note to staff.

Speed unleashed
The latest Need For Speed, Unbound, rolled in rather suddenly this month. The latest entry in the series takes a different aesthetic approach, leaning on some stylized features that give me some Spider-Verse vibes. Still, it seems like the reception has at least been somewhat solid.
Nevertheless, these are some notable departures for Criterion. Hopefully the long-time racing game studio can lean into the curve on them and come out ahead.

There’s a casket in my parents’ basement. But unlike all the other caskets, this one doesn’t have human remains in it. It contains all my old Pokemon stuff. All of my cards and figures, the Pokemon Power mini-issues that Nintendo Power printed when the first game was approaching release, stickers I printed from Pokemon Snap at a Blockbuster kiosk, the first two movies on DVD; pretty much everything I collected back then, all in this plastic bin.
I didn’t realize it until recently; I had buried this part of my childhood right next to my Star Wars stuff. Back in the day, I was there on day one when Pokemon Red/Blue dropped. Eventually, I fell out of love with it, and it wasn’t just the inexorable march of time eroding my soul; it’s the fact that Pokemon neve…</span>

After writing about Final Fight 2 for the SNES, a few people suggested I look more into Final Fight 3. Admittedly, it’s been a while since I last played it. Thinking about it, I was probably just out of college when I last went through it with a roommate. It has at least been long enough that I forgot about the enemies that are literally Nazis. Stahlhelm, stielhandgranate, the name “Fritz.” Guys are Wehrmacht as all get out. So now I get to see Mike Haggar pile-drive Nazis into the pavement, and I wonder how I’ve gone so long without it. I previously said the original arcade Final Fight was the only one worth playing, but anything that lets you suplex the German infantry is required reading in my book.
In any case, Final Fight 3 is the last sequel to the brawler tha…</span>

                              <span>The only embarrassing thing is being embarrassed
Since its release in June, the speedrunning first-person parkour shooter Neon White has been plagued by one common criticism. I&#x27;ve heard it more times than I can count, and it comes up as a counterpoint nearly every time I praise the game: &quot;It&#x27;s a good game with bad writing.&quot; The complaint doesn&#x27;t always arrive in those words (I&#x27;ve also heard it described as &quot;so cringy&quot; many times), but the philosophy has pervaded discussion of the game for six months now.
There&#x27;s just one problem: it&#x27;s completely wrong. Neon White is a good game with good writing. And yes, it&#x27;s a good game with writing that sometimes makes me cringe. Most of the jokes are cheap gags about the main character being either stupid or horny. The entire conceit of parkour demons …</span>

                              <span>When it finally drops, you won&#x27;t see me for weeks
It&#x27;s been rumored for years at this point, and fans of the series have been desperately trying to manifest it into existence, but now it&#x27;s official: Guerrilla is working on a Horizon multiplayer project, as they confirmed via their Twitter account today. It wasn&#x27;t so much of an announcement specifically highlighting the upcoming multiplayer game as it was a post of job listings, but it&#x27;s confirmation and that&#x27;s all I care about. Even when these big studios try to play their cards close to their chest, it&#x27;s those darn job listings that always give them away -- they have to make the game somehow, and I find it kind of a fun tradition now that we find out in a kind of indirect way.
https://twitter.com/LifeAtGuerrilla/status/1603752192166469634
The text of the tweet itself is innocent enough, but the studio announces their future plans clearly within the attached graphic. &quot;We are continuing to create epic solo adventures for Aloy. But there is more,&quot; the post reads. &quot;A new internal team is developing a separate Online Project set in Horizon&#x27;s universe. Featuring a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look, friends will be able to explore the majestic wilds of Horizon together.&quot; Okay, so maybe this time around, the announcement was a bit more direct than usual.
Guerrilla has a whole host of new positions open from Combat Designers to Technical Artists to Programmers, but admittedly the roles that intrigue me the most are the narrative-focused positions. It&#x27;s cool to see that the studio is investing some of its new talent into the storytelling side of things, because Horizon is so well known for its incredible worldbuilding and engaging narrative. I will absolutely be looking forward to any updates on the project, but this announcement alone is enough excitement to keep me going for a while.

                              <span>You only have a few days left
As we mentioned this morning, this is your second chance to dive into a weekend of Charizard raiding (and catching! Well, once!) in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Since then I&#x27;ve seen some confusion as to how to unlock and find these seven-star raids: so here&#x27;s a full breakdown. Remember, you have until December 18 at 3:59PM PT to get your Charizard, or grind out the rewards.
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven&#x27;t already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;354675,354676&quot;]
Locate it on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing dragon icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You&#x27;ll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100, and with an affinity for taking down a dragon/fire type. In any case, we have a full guide on how to take down Charizard here!
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;354677,354678&quot;]
Search for a raid, even if you don&#x27;t have one available
Alternatively, if you don&#x27;t want to host a raid (or don&#x27;t have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Charizard on the list. As soon as you see it click it: as you&#x27;ll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Charizard raids show up, wait for the &quot;check for new postings&quot; sign to light up: then press X to search again.

                              <span>A list full of frustrating, chaotic fun
Fall Guys seems to have just caught the end of the battle royale trend, but it&#x27;s easily one of the silliest and fun games to take on the genre. You and your friends all take on the role of a little bean-shaped creature and run the gauntlet of different obstacle courses akin to the slapstick fun of the classic American gameshow, Wipeout. Don&#x27;t forget you can also dress your bean up in all kinds of goofy costumes to make your run all the more giggle-inducing.
Of course, as much as we all love Fall Guys, any game is going to get a bit stale after we play it for a certain number of hours. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve compiled this list of awesome games to check out if you want to play Fall Guys, but you also don&#x27;t want to play Fall Guys. In other words, here are sev…</span>

[Update: Pre-orders are live! You can find Best Buy links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here, and GameStop links for Sephiroth and Kazuya here. As of publication, Target also has Sephiroth and Kazuya. Thanks CJ!]
Well, Nintendo finally gave us amiibo collectors a lifeline, and revealed the full release date for the Sephiroth and Kazuya figures: January 13, 2023. That&#x27;s soon! Amid that announcement, Nintendo has noted that folks should &quot;look forward to the release of Pyra and Mythra,&quot; which is coming at some point in 2023.
Based on prior release cadences, Smash amiibo release waves are typically five-ish months apart, but they could be coming out sooner than that. In Japan, Pyra and Mythra are being sold as a double pack, but it&#x27;s not clear if that format will be the standard around the world. All that&#x27;s left on the amiibo list now for Super Smash Bros. is Sora. We haven&#x27;t had full confirmation of his figure yet, or when it might release: but mid-to-late-2023 could be possible.
Right now there are no pre-orders available in most regions of the world. However, the Nintendo of Japan store does have all of the above (sans Sora): though they immediately sold out:
Sephiroth
Kazuya
Pyra/Mythra double pack
As always, here&#x27;s a full up to date amiibo list that we&#x27;ve been keeping track of since the beginning. You can also find full images of the amiibo models in the embedded tweet, or the gallery below.

During last week&#x27;s Game Awards, we were introduced to four more characters headed to Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 — And while we were able to gleam some information on Dee Jay, Manon, and Marisa, one particular newcomer remains shrouded in unnerving mystery — the suave gentleman J.P.
We know very, very little about this eldery gent, aside from the fact that he is an extremely rich and powerful individual, essentially holding court over his off-grid nation of Nayshall. Though clearly a man of poise and presence, we are left concerned by his seemingly casual control of what appears to be Psycho Power, the dangerous and ethereal spirit that fueled long-time antagonist M. Bison. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, J.P.&#x27;s overall sense of style and personal interests, …</span>

Fortnite is getting another anime collaboration today, this time with some superpowered stars. Deku, Bakugo, Uraraka, and All Might from My Hero Academia arrive in Fortnite today with purchasable skins and cosmetics in the Item Shop.
Over in the Item Shop, the four aforementioned heroes are getting their own skins and special items. Midoriya&#x27;s skin comes with an All Might Back Bling, for instance, while Bakugo&#x27;s cosmetics are suitably explosive. There are emotes as well, featuring bits like Deku&#x27;s tendency to take notes on heroes and All Might&#x27;s cheerful laugh.

Sorry this review took so long! Our reviewer had the game crash on them on PS5 during the initial process: and after the performance patch. Meanwhile, I had a smoother experience playing The Callisto Protocol: but it didn&#x27;t help all that much.

The Callisto Protocol (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Striking Distance Studios
Publisher: Krafton
Released: December 2, 2022
MSRP: $59.99/$69.99
At first, I was floored to dig more into this world. When your horror adventure starts off with a sci-fi plane crash and the main character (played by a confident Josh Duhamel, who recently did a mean rendition of Harvey Dent/Two-Face in The Killing Joke animated two-parter) is hauled away by hulking robotic guards to prison, I&#x27;m in.

Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Chris Metzen, one of the formative creators of the Warcraft franchise, has rejoined the studio to work on future releases in the World of Warcraft series. Metzen retired in 2016, having worked on the fantasy franchise since its formation in the early 1990s.
Metzen&#x27;s return was announced in a statement by current World of Warcraft manager John Hight.
&quot;It is with great joy that I announce Chris Metzen has joined the Warcraft Leadership Team as Creative Advisor. Chris’s focus initially will be on World of Warcraft, then his work will expand to other projects across this growing franchise&quot;, wrote Hight. &quot;We are so happy to be reuniting him with the world he helped create.&quot;

With the start of a new Pokemon generation comes a new stage in the long-running animated series. And it looks like this time, Ash and Pikachu won&#x27;t be setting out for the new region full of Pokemon.
A new trailer today shows what&#x27;s next for the animated Pokemon series. It starts by confirming that the final episodes of Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series will air over the coming days, specifically the &quot;final chapter&quot; in Ash and Pikachu&#x27;s story.

The next battle of squid kids and octolings will kick off in the first weekend of January, and will see players fight it out in another weekend of colorful chaos — hoping to bring home the gong for their team and bag themselves some exclusive rewards.
This time around, the topic is — quite literally — a matter of taste, as players will have to choose which is their favorite food flavoring. The options on the dinner table are Spicy, Sweet, and Sour, (a topic that sound suspiciously familiar, and I&#x27;m pretty sure that they&#x27;ve re-run the fun for this particular splatfest). It&#x27;s also worth noting that spicy is a sensation and not a taste ACKSHUALLY. I feel sorry for anybody not on Team Sweet, as I have a feeling the public vote is gonna be running away with this one.
So far, Splatoon 3 hosts Big Man and Shiver have both secured Splatfest wins, but poor old Frye is yet to capture glory. Maybe January&#x27;s event will see her finally crack that losing streak (watch her get Team Sour). The Taste Bud Turf War will commence worldwide on Friday January 6 (North America) and Saturday January 7 (Europe) and will conclude 48 hours later. We&#x27;ll be sure to give y&#x27;all a reminder!
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

At the top of December, Game Freak held a special event that allowed players to capture a level 100 7-star raid Charizard in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, but it only ran for a few days. Well, you have another chance!
The event is back on as of last night (December 15), and will run through the afternoon/evening of December 18 (US). To find the Charizard, all you need to do is search for a pulsing dragon Tera Raid icon: or use the online menu to navigate and browse for Charizard raids. If you&#x27;re interested in whether or not it&#x27;s worth your time, we have a full rundown of the Charizard&#x27;s moves and loadout here, as well as a full guide on how to unlock higher-end raids.
I&#x27;m calling this a second chance, not a last chance, because...
The official Pokemon site has this little blurb to let folks know that this isn&#x27;t the be-all-end-all of getting a Charizard in Scarlet &amp; Violet:
&quot;Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future.&quot;

Hopefully that process will not involve walking into a video game retailer; but it could also just be a Pokemon Home early-use bonus, or something super simple like that.
Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Charizard Tera Raid event (second chance times):
Thursday, December 15, 2022, at 4:00 p.m. – Sunday, December 18, 2022, at 3:59 p.m. PST

Capcom has opened the servers, (this time officially), for the second closed beta of its great-looking scrapper Street Fighter 6. If you received an invite to the second beta, or if you previously partook in the October beta, then you should now be able to download the SF6 Beta client on PS5, PC, or Xbox Series X respectively.
Between now and Monday, the lucky participants will be able to let loose in a truncated version of the upcoming sequel. Much like the first beta, there are eight selectable characters, (Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, Juri, Kimberly, Luke, and Jamie) and six available stages. Players can take the opportunity to build a custom character, check out the Battle Hub, play some Capcom classics, and jump into training while they wait for an online opponent. The comedic &quot;Extreme Battle&quot; mode always makes its return.
The Street Fighter 6 second closed beta will end Monday, December 19 at 00:00 UTC.

If you were not fortunate enough to receive a beta, whether you were creating wholesome content or otherwise, then I understand your frustration and disappointment. However, it is incredibly likely that Capcom will hold further betas, (very likely open betas), between now and the game&#x27;s official launch in June 2023. I know it sucks not to receive access, I&#x27;ve felt that pain with other games, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be jumping into battle with everybody else at some point in early 2023.
Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox July 2, 2023. Be sure to check out our other reports on the sequel, including my 50 things I loved about the beta feature, as well as CJ Andriessen’s experience with the &quot;Modern&quot; control system. You can also read our recent reports on incoming characters Manon, Dee Jay, and Marisa. A report on the mysterious J.P. will be arriving later today.

Nintendo has dropped another quartet of classic Sega Genesis titles into the Nintendo Switch Online library of 16-bit classics. All subscribers to the Expansion Pack service can check out the four new/old releases today, simply by downloading them from the Sega Genesis library.
The new selection runs a gauntlet of genres and contains some bonafide icons from the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis golden years. Scrolling brawler fans can take to the streets with the excellent 1991 release Golden Axe II, or drop the axes and pick up a bazooka or two with 1990&#x27;s goofy, sci-fi classic Alien Storm.
Also released in 1990, puzzle heads will find the still-compelling block buster Columns a fine way to while away a lazy afternoon, while one-on-one fight fans can check out Sega&#x27;s 1996 Genesis port of Virtua Fighter 2, a highly ambitious release that bravely attempted to squeeze the smash-hit arcade into a humble 16-bit cartridge.
Alien Storm, Columns, Golden Axe II, and Virtua Fighter 2 are now available to download for all Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers via the NSO app on your Nintendo Switch dashboard.

The Dead Space remake is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and it&#x27;s right around the corner as we near its January 27 release date. The team at Motive Studio have just completed the final step before release: they&#x27;ve gone gold! For those who may not know, this simply means that the team has finalized a version of the game that they&#x27;re happy with, and sent it off to begin the physical manufacturing process to be made into discs, and to get the digital version ready to go up on its various platforms. It&#x27;s a huge milestone at the end of the development process, and while it doesn&#x27;t necessarily guarantee the game will come out on its announced release date, it&#x27;s a good sign that there likely won&#x27;t be a delay between now and January 27. Woohoo!
https://twitter.com/MotiveStudio/status/1603480192755851278
The studio took to Twitter to announce their gold status, announcing &quot;WE ARE WHOLE AGAIN&quot; to the entire world. Nothing like an ominous yet celebratory tweet to get me in the mood for some spooky space adventures. I admittedly didn&#x27;t play the original Dead Space series out of fear, but now that I&#x27;m getting better with horror games, I&#x27;m thinking this time it&#x27;s gonna be worth a shot.
Motive Studio was created by Jade Raymond, an executive known for helping to create the Assassin&#x27;s Creed and Watch Dogs series, under the larger EA umbrella. Motive created two games within the Star Wars franchise in 2017 and 2020, Battlefront II and Squardons, before deciding to shift their focus back to the beloved Dead Space series. In addition to the remake, Motive also announced that they&#x27;re working on an Untitled Iron Man game for Marvel, which should be interesting to see as it will likely come around near the same time as Insomniac&#x27;s Wolverine adaptation.
Dead Space will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on January 27, 2023.

A new trailer for Fire Emblem Engage details all the activities you&#x27;ll be doing outside of combat. Fishing, cooking, training, and more take the spotlight in a lengthy look at the home base activities in Fire Emblem Engage.
The Somniel is a floating home that your protagonist calls their own over the course of Engage. The castle acts as your home base, where characters you&#x27;ve recruited hang out and enjoy leisure activities, away from battle.
There are a few different categories of things to do in the Somniel, so we&#x27;ll run through them one-by-one.

                              <span>The next entry in the Ys series aims for next year
Falcom has announced the next numbered entry in the long-running Ys RPG series. Ys X: Nordics will launch next year.
News about this broke last night during an annual meeting, soon followed by the official news. Ys X is the latest numerical entry in the series, targeting PlayStation 4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. It&#x27;s currently set to launch in Japan sometime in 2023.
According to a description of the game (thanks Gematsu), Ys X: Nordics will once again follow hero Adol Christin in a new adventure, this time set in the northern Obelia Bay. There are many islands and sea-faring people here, as well as some immortal undead who like to attack humans.
Ys X: Nordics will also let the player control a ship, for the first time in the series. Considering Adol&#x27;s history with boats, it might not be a wise idea to put him at the helm. But hey, maybe the ship won&#x27;t wreck this time.

Fighting in tandem
Battles look otherwise very action-y and flashy, as you would expect from a Ys game. The new Cross Action system will allow the player to fight in two modes: Solo Mode lets you control one fighter with automatic attacks and support from a partner, while Combination Mode has the player simultaneously controlling both characters for a series of actions.
Nothing&#x27;s been formally announced about an English localization just yet. We have eventually received previous entries in the Ys series though, like Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and Ys IX: Monstrum Nox. Odds seem decent that sooner or later, we&#x27;ll hear more about Ys X: Nordics.

                              <span>Valve have announced that the Steam Winter Sale will begin next week on December 22nd. I can already see myself standing in front of my mirror, chanting &quot;I do not need more games&quot; before sitting back down at my desk and splurging on everything I missed from this year&#x27;s RPS advent calendar. 
Valve have given us a peek at what&#x27;s going to be on sale, so click through to see what you should avoid buying until it starts.

                              <span>All the flap about World Of Warcraft: Dragonflight has made it easier than ever to forget there&#x27;s a whole New World out there, but there is, and it&#x27;s temporarily free. You can jump into the frontier of Amazon Games vaguely piratical MMO without paying a penny this weekend, where you&#x27;re free to lark about until December 19th. Has the recent early game overhaul alleviated the opening grind? Perhaps!

                              <span>I can&#x27;t think of a better place for turn-based fights than in the margins of medieval manuscripts. There&#x27;s a wealth of weirdness to draw on, and Inkulinati seems admirably willing to dip its quill into messed-up cats and donkeys playing double-ended trumpets. We&#x27;ve been waiting a while for it, but we&#x27;ll only have to wait a little longer, as developers Yaza Games have just announced they&#x27;ll be launching on Steam Early Access on January 31st.
They&#x27;ve also sketched out a new demo to tide us over, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed my little poke at it.

It&#x27;s the most magical time of the year, especially now that charming co-op shooter Deep Rock Galactic has launched its annual Yuletide Elf Hunt. It&#x27;s time to dress up your dwarves, grab your pickaxes, and get back to hauling rocks for an oppressive corporation. There&#x27;s double XP in it for you.

                              <span>As has seemingly become a yearly tradition in my gaming calendar, I have ended up finishing 2022 in much the same way I finished 2021: reviewing yet another Final Fantasy VII game. Last year, it was the PC release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, this year it&#x27;s Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, a remaster of the original game&#x27;s PSP prequel. As such, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about Final Fantasy VII these last few weeks, and playing them so close together has ended up highlighting one key thing for me. Namely, that story chapters that break up the action by giving players some &#x27;downtime&#x27; to &#x27;hang&#x27; with your party pals, either by doing side or fetch quests for them MUST DIE. 
Drop a meteor on them or let them go the way of Aerith and be skewered into oblivion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, because please, Square Enix, I simply cannot with the interminable sidequest chapters any more.

Its name is Legacy Of The Moonspell, and it adds a new map along with new characters and enemies and weapons, all inspired by Japanese folkore (including a variety of yokai and oni). For a mere £1.50, it is perfect. Do you like Vampire Survivors and want more? Buddy, it&#x27;s right here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not all that easy for an action platformer to stand out, even if it does a lot of things right. I&#x27;ll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;ll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going &quot;wheeee!&quot;.
Very quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you&#x27;ll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you&#x27;ll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.

                              <span>The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company&#x27;s long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. 
Anyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it&#x27;s because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it&#x27;s been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal!

                              <span>When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren&#x27;t that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you&#x27;ll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.
Having now spent a few hours with the final game, I&#x27;ve concluded that my mind must&#x27;ve been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun&#x27;s verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you&#x27;ll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it&#x27;s a shame the FPS side can&#x27;t match it.

                              <span>Nothing beats the audio design of Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II. You know when you look at a light for too long and then close your eyes, and you see an imprint of the light against your retinas? The sound of an elevator in Dark Forces II is similarly burned into my memory, whether I like it or not. As is the excellent &quot;EUURRYAAAARRGH!&quot; death-cry that protagonist Kyle Katarn makes as he takes one blaster bolt too many and collapses onto the ground.

I can’t say it’s a surprise, then, that Death Stranding, which just had its sequel confirmed at The Game Awards last week, is being adapted for film. Kojima Productions are working with production company Hammerstone Studios to bring the BB Boys&#x27; post-apocalyptic hiking trip to life.

It was kind of like the Neanderthal to the Steam Deck’s Homo sapiens, existing for a brief few years before being discontinued back in 2019. Steam Controllers were an unusual evolutionary offshoot of the by-then fairly standardised controller layout, with funky clickable trackpads taking the place of thumbsticks. Well, Valve’s designers seem to be up for reviving the concept in some form. At least, that’s what they’ve told The Verge in an interview about the Steam Deck’s first nine months.

                              <span>Blizzard have revealed that former Warcraft lore maestro Chris Metzen is returning as creative advisor for the series. Metzen had retired back in 2016 after decades of working on Warcraft and Blizzard’s other games. The return was shared by Warcraft general manager Jon Hight in a statement posted to Twitter, which confirmed that Metzen will initially return to the company to work on the long-running World Of Warcraft.

Hours of documentaries chronicle how artists expressed their struggles through brushstrokes, or how an actor agonised over creating an accurate character to counterbalance their imposter syndrome or anxiety.

How long did it take you to beat Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet? 20 hours? 30 hours? Well, the speedrunning community is here to put us to shame, as Automaton Media has spotted that the latest Pokémon games are being completed in under five and a half hours.
At the time of writing, the world record on Speedrun.com is held by Pokémon speedrunner truely, who has managed to beat the game in an impressive 5 hours, 27 minutes and 11 seconds. Okay, so that&#x27;s all three story paths, a decently levelled team of Pokémon, and plenty of other things we don&#x27;t want to spoil here, all wrapped up in an evening?

Earlier today, The Pokémon Company confirmed that long-time anime protagonist Ash Ketchum would be stepping back from the series after 25 years. In January 2023, one final run of episodes - called Pokémon - Aim to be a Pokémon Master - will mark the final chapter for Ash and his companion Pikachu.
In the wake of the news, Sarah Natochenny - who has provided the English voiceover for Ash since 2006 - has taken to Twitter to share a message reflecting on her time with the franchise and what the character means to her.

After landing a huge new update in the form of the &quot;Missions in Uncharted Space&quot; expansion, Disney Dreamlight Valley has today received a quick hotfix to make sure that all of these features are running as they should.
The changes made this time around are mainly tweaks to the new quests - many of which focus around the latest additions of Woody and Buzz to the Valley. There is also a slight change to the size of the Boba Tea which was appearing in the game, as well as the usual stability and optimisation improvements.

But you already know that we&#x27;re excited for Zelda, so we canvassed the Nintendo Life team to find out what else is on our wishlists for 2023...

There were a few things that we could say for certain about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet prior to their release: the games would be a commercial success, Nintendo would push tie-ins wherever it could (hi Splatoon fans!) and at some point, we would be 100% guaranteed a Smoliv plushie. Well, now the latter of these has also come true, with Paldea&#x27;s edible little guy joining Lechonk and Pawmi in a new cuddly range coming to Japan&#x27;s Pokémon Centers (thanks, Nintendo Soup).
The latest collection will be appearing in the wild (and by that we mean &#x27;retail&#x27;) from 24th December and they should be available for international purchases from Amazon JP shortly after. Nothing says &quot;sorry for forgetting your Christmas present&quot; quite like a huggable olive now does it?

Toby, it seems, is having a very bad day. He’s found himself stuck in a mansion, investigating the strange happenings within it and why he seems to be trapped in it. Paper Cut Mansion is all about uncovering the truth behind the unusual surroundings and surviving long enough to make it to the next floor. There is an attempt to spice up the typical roguelite formula with unique visuals and setting, but the game falls short of greatness by not polishing up those changes enough.
The first thing that you’ll notice about Paper Cut Mansion is the visuals, which are a strange creepy papercraft aesthetic that gives powerful Corpse Bride or Psychonauts vibes throughout. The jazzy soundtrack and occasional musical number that plays as you make your way through the levels of the mansion only add to this feeling. The art design is fantastic and is easily the part of the game that stands out from the plethora of roguelites on Switch.

                              <span>Update: Get Creepy Tale 2 for free.
It&#x27;s safe to say that we all love Switch games, but you know what&#x27;s better? Free Switch games. Fortunately, No Gravity Games is once again giving them out by the sack-load this December (if by &#x27;sack-load&#x27; you mean a maximum of 12, that is) as a part of the &#x27;12 Games of Christmas&#x27; - hey, it&#x27;s certainly one way of getting games out there.
The event began on 5th December and will run through until 16th December with a brand new game being made available for free on each day. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning right off the bat that this offer only applies to North American eShop accounts.

The Pokémon Company has confirmed that Ash Ketchum&#x27;s Pokémon journey is about to come to an end. In a video posted on Twitter, it&#x27;s been announced that 11 special episodes - dubbed &#x27;Aim to be a Pokémon Master&#x27; - will air in Japan starting January 13th, 2023 and will mark the final chapter in Ash and Pikachu&#x27;s story.
It&#x27;s the end of an era, to be sure. Ash&#x27;s journey started all the way back in April 1997 with the &#x27;Indigo League&#x27;, featuring classic episodes like &quot;Showdown in Pewter City&quot;, &quot;Charmander – The Stray Pokémon&quot;, and &quot;Battle Aboard the St. Anne&quot;. The iconic protagonist featured in dozens of feature movies and even made some subtle appearances in the video game series.

Outright Games has announced that Peppa Pig&#x27;s next step into the world of video games, Peppa Pig: World Adventures, will be landing on the Switch 10th March, 2023.
Following on from the rampant success of last year&#x27;s My Friend Peppa Pig (which, as noted by the publisher, &quot;had a higher Metacritic score than AAA titles including Battlefield 2042&quot;), the next game will see Peppa and co. heading out on a globe-spanning adventure by plane, train or boat. There&#x27;s no concern for the family&#x27;s carbon trotter-print here.

Nintendo has officially begun the countdown to the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest and this is going to be a tasty one. Moving on from the last Pokémon-themed take on the format (and in no way related to that horrifying eating Pokémon trend) the next event asks the question, &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite taste sensation?&quot; with the team choices falling between Spicy, Sweet and Sour.
Kicking off on 7th January, 2023 and running through until the early hours of the 9th, the taste bud Turf War feels like it has been a long time coming. After all, it has been over a month now since we were all representing Team Fire-, Water- or Grass-Type in the last inky dual.

Back in October, The Witcher Netflix series - loosely inspired by CD Projekt Red&#x27;s video games - announced Henry Cavill (who plays the main character Geralt) would be replaced by Liam Hemsworth in Season 4.
Not long after this, Cavill announced he would be reprising his role as Superman. Now, in a separate development, Cavill has officially been dropped by the DC Universe - with the new co-chairman James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, Suicide Squad) announcing an overhaul to the Superman movies.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>After 25 years, the latest season of the Pokémon anime saw protagonist Ash Ketchum finally achieve his dream of becoming Pokémon World Champion. Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.


The Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo&#x27;s achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.
Sometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.
So this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash&#x27;s exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset? Are you looking forward to finally seeing a series starring new heroes and storylines? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Fortnite is crossing over with another big anime. This time, the saviors of My Hero Academia join the fight. Beginning today, you can rack up victory royales as characters from the hit series, compete in a new game mode, and earn rewards by completing special challenges. 


You can purchase outfits for Izuka Midoriya, All Might, Katsuki Bakugo, and Ochaco Uraraka. Each comes with a matching back bling and pickaxe. New items include the Deku’s Smash item, which allows players to pummel opponents and structures by challenging the power of One for All. You can also pick up two new emotes: Symbol of Peace and Hero Analysis. All Might will also be showering the battlefield with loot-filled supply drops. 
You can sharpen your superhero skills at the Hero Training Gym. This new Creative mode lets players select one of three classes to face other players in team battles. You’ll earn Rescue Points for your squad by eliminating players or capturing Rescue Zones that pop up in the arena. The first team to earn 100 points wins the challenge. 
Completing limited-time My Hero Academia quests earns XP and special items in either battle royale mode or the Hero Training Gym. These missions are:
Complete the “Assist in Eliminating Opponents on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Deku Spray.
Complete the “Secure Rescue Points on the Hero Training Gym island” Quest to earn the Plus Ultra Spray.
Complete a total of four My Hero Academia Quests to earn the Deku’s Glove Emoticon.

At the time I ran some AOCC 4.0 benchmarks on the Ryzen 7000 series and compared it to GCC and Clang. Since then I&#x27;ve had the time on my Genoa test rig to look at how well AOCC 4.0 is performing and in this article are some benchmarks with the EPYC 9374F processors between GCC and AOCC 4.0.</span>

Bringing someone home for the holidays that your folks would not approve of is nothing new. A time-honored tradition of rebellion and experimentation as you search for who you are and who you will choose to walk that path with you. But there are times when the look on your parent’s faces when you introduce them to your significant other is well worth the price of admission.
It is in that decidedly petty spirit I bring to you, humble reader, ten fighting game characters you should definitely date if you want to piss off your parents.

Lord Raptor (Darkstalkers)

                              <span>We&#x27;ve missed you, Spidey
As part of an end-of-year post from PlayStation, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man developer Insomniac has returned to give us the newest update on the game&#x27;s sequel: a release window. The PlayStation blog is meant to highlight the platform&#x27;s upcoming highlights for the new year, and what better way to start it off than with Insomniac&#x27;s announcement that Spider-Man 2 will be coming in fall of 2023. Okay, so that&#x27;s a pretty big window, and there&#x27;s always the chance that the game could be delayed. At the very least, though, it&#x27;s nice to that development is coming along nicely and, for now, we can expect to play the game by the end of next year.

Insomiac&#x27;s 2018 title Spider-Man, and its follow-up, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, are some of the best-loved games to come out of the last console generation. Based on the swinging mechanics alone, I have to agree. I&#x27;ve never played a game that made me feel more like a superhero, and I&#x27;ve been known to return to the game even after completing it just to swing my way around Manhattan. While Marvel had already taken over the box office, Insomniac secured the studio&#x27;s hold on the newest console generation with the best superhero games since the Arkham series.
I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Spider-Man 2 has been one of the most anticipated upcoming titles out there, so getting confirmation that it&#x27;s on the way is going to be a huge boost for fans. We&#x27;ve got plenty to keep us busy in the mean time with all of the awesome releases headed our way in the first half of 2023 (I&#x27;m personally keeping an eye on Breath of the Wild: Tears of the Kingdom and Hades II), but I think it&#x27;s safe to say that when Spider-Man 2 finally drops, we&#x27;re ready to drop everything to slip back into the suit of our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.

My entire life, I’ve been really, really sensitive to horror. I usually chalk it up to being raised in a fundamentalist Christian family where I was told from a very young age that not only are Satan and demons real, but they are coming to get me and I have to actively fight them from taking control of my mind. Either that or I’m just a little too sensitive. Who’s to say?
Regardless, some of my childhood memories involve scary movies, or rather, my aversion to watching them. At my best friend’s sleepover birthday party in middle school, I spent an entire two hours upstairs by myself because I was too scared of whatever crappy C-tier horror flick they turned on that night. I once fled a family viewing of What Lies Beneath in tears because it was just…</span>

A couple of weeks ago, I ranked every Kingdom Hearts game, worst to best, and I placed Kingdom Hearts Dark Road right at the bottom without hesitation. That title, in my memory, was a clumsy cash grab with bland design decisions that largely served to funnel players back into its real-cash shop. You know, a gacha game.
In August 2022, though, Dark Road went offline. The game remains accessible with an overhauled shop, and, crucially, no in-app purchases. Everything is now available with in-game currency. I always want to give games more chances, and I often feel bad for games that are deemed &quot;bad&quot; by everyone, so I figured it was time to try Kingdom Hearts Dark Road again. I downloaded the game once more and played it front-to-back, and I purchased and upgraded every …</span>

Developer/publisher Bliss Brain has announced that it will release the Wonder Boy Anniversary Collection on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch platforms in January 2023. This is an extended edition of the incredibly barebones Wonder Boy Collection, which launched back in June of this year.
The Wonder Boy Anniversary Collection features a total of 21 versions of six key titles from the platforming franchise, established by studio Westone Bit way back in 1986. Featured in the compilation are a variety of arcade and home releases of Wonder Boy (1986), Wonder Boy in Monster Land (1987) Wonder Boy The Dragon&#x27;s Trap (1989), Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair (1988), Wonder Boy in Monster World (1991), and Wonder Boy IV (1994).

Hideo Kojima will produce alongside Hammerstone Studios&#x27; Alex Lebovici, who executive produced this year&#x27;s surprise horror hit Barbarian. The film is being fully financed by Hammerstone (per Variety), with Kojima Productions US and Allan Ungar as executive producers.
The plot, according to Variety, is being kept under wraps, though the outlet&#x27;s heard that it will introduce new elements and characters. No writer or director is publicly locked in yet.

And it seems that the party is only just getting started.

As we enter 2023, Skullgirls 2nd Encore will begin a year-long rollout of new characters, console ports, balance updates, and new merchandise, celebrating a full decade of fist-throwin&#x27;, hair-slammin&#x27;, charleston-boppin&#x27; action.

Of the four World Warriors making a fresh appearance at The Game Awards last week, only one would be recognizable to the Street Fighter faithful — Having taken time out from the series for a few years, Street Fighter 6 will see the return of the ultimate party animal and dance hall superstar, Dee Jay Maximum!
Dee Jay made his Street Fighter debut way back in 1993, as one of the four new faces added to the legendary Super Street Fighter II. Hailing from Jamaica, Dee Jay is local superhero, renowned for his loud, brash, all-night parties, excellent musicianship, and infectiously upbeat personality. Rarely seen without a toothy smile plastered across his jaw, Dee Jay is easily one of the SF universe&#x27;s most happy-go-lucky characters, living his best life without a care in t…</span>

Soccer Story is a charming role-playing adventure that seamlessly builds a joyous and often goofy story around something as simple as kicking a ball. A cataclysmic event causes soccer to be banned unless sanctioned by the evil Soccer Inc. (with more than a few parallels to real-world FIFA), and our young hero’s father goes missing during the catastrophe. A year later, a magical soccer ball comes crashing into our hero’s life. What comes next is an often silly and fun story about bringing soccer back to the world, filled w…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

In April, Crystal Dynamics revealed that it was developing the next Tomb Raider game in its series that began with a reboot back in 2013. They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel.

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.


&quot;A physical edition of Cuphead is something we&#x27;ve been excited about for a very long time,&quot; Studio MDHR director Maja Moldenhauer sai…</span>

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X. 
&quot;The game is an artistic combination of action, shooting, strategy, and puzzles,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;The PS VR2 headset and PS…</span>

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

By doing so you could increase your Link-like character&#x27;s movement speed, change the behaviour of enemies, or - in the case of a puzzle that has taken 8 years to crack - discover secret rooms.

This is a deal on an 18TB hard drive from Amazon, a Seagate Exos X18 7200RPM CMR drive that will allow you to install all the games** or back up all the things**, or maybe both. This huge HDD has been reduced to £287, a historic low, which works out as 1.6p per gigabyte - absolutely crazy given the size we&#x27;re working with here. 
**Your mileage may vary, but if you are able to legitimately fill this I will be genuinely impressed.

                              <span>What better way to win back your community after the rocky launch of a new game than by providing a free &quot;upgrade&quot; to a beloved old game? I&#x27;ve no way of knowing if that&#x27;s what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month &quot;upgrading all copies&quot; of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC.

There’s a whole bunch more stuff in the update including the new version of the Shipment map for Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, which you take a look at in the video below.

There’s only a week and a bit to go before the day itself, and I’ve got all my decorations up and everything. I just haven’t found that festive groove. Cat-wrangling puzzler A Little To The Left has something in its Christmas sack that might spur on some kind of festive awakening though. Between December 22nd and 27th, A Little To The Left’s putting aside its Daily Tidy Delivery mode of randomly generated individual challenges to offer six holiday-themed messes for you to make spick and/or span.

Those two worked on The Expanse, and were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Children Of Men. No word on who will play the spartan goliath just yet, but the Clive Owen for Kratos campaign starts here.

                              <span>At some point recently, Crocs became cool. And as someone who grew up in the &quot;Crocs are for dweebs&quot; era, this makes little sense to me. Crocs? Cool? These sillies must be mistaken. Thankfully, after a couple of weeks with Lil Gator Game, I finally get it. All these people weren&#x27;t talking about the shoe, of course!

                              <span>While I procrastinate as hard as the next desk jockey, in truth I&#x27;ve never had the patience for Minesweeper. It doesn&#x27;t have the fast pace and stunning climax of Solitaire, y&#x27;know? So what if we jazz it up by smashing in another puzzle game. Like in Minesweeper Tetris, released for free on Steam this morning, which kinda adds Tetris by making the screen slowly fill in with fresh lines of mines, challenging you to clear mines quickly. It twists my melon, man.

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below:

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

                              <span>Ixion is the latest release from Bulwark Studios, the developers perhaps best known for the dangerously underrated 40K: Mechanicus. Landing in December alongside some blockbusters it too threatens to fly under a lot of people’s radars, and I’m here today mostly to try and make sure that doesn’t happen.

Developers CD Projekt Red now say they&#x27;re &quot;actively investigating&quot; the problems, and will update us on what they find &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.

I say hippies, I mean bloodthirsty thugs who happen to like psychedelics. 
The update has also increased security for the popular Cayo Perico heist, which was one of the main ways people earned their money, so folks are understandably grumpy. Maybe they can sell some acid instead?

                              <span>Earlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.

The event sees Crytek&#x27;s excellent multiplayer cowboy sneak &#x27;em up periodically set fire to big parts of each map, where you blow up creepy bleedy statues for points that unlock new weapons and traits. There&#x27;s one that makes you invisible to monsters, which sounds ridiculously powerful - which is probably why the traits will only be in play until the event ends on January 15th.

Patch 9 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate III is out now, adding playable Paladins and increasing the level cap to 5. In true D&amp;D spirit, that&#x27;s when you get the good stuff, like the ability to fly or summon zombies. Heck, I think you can summon zombies and make *them* fly. It&#x27;s a whole new world.
Come watch the developers natter all about it in a festive edition of one of their Panels From Hell. One of them is dressed up as a knitting reindeer, and they just announced critical role chap Matthew Mercer will voice a new character.

                              <span>Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath&#x27;s exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you&#x27;ve dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite sad that one of The Geoff Awards 2022 announcements I&#x27;m most excited about likely targeted me and no-one else. And that&#x27;s because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn&#x27;t show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I&#x27;d argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn&#x27;t a life investment, and that&#x27;s rad.

                              <span>Earlier this year I watched a very short presentation of Inkbound, an upcoming turn-based roguelike from Shiny Shoe, the devs behind deckbuilder Monster Train. I thought it had potential, but it&#x27;s difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you&#x27;ve got to go on is footage they&#x27;d prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I&#x27;m excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe&#x27;s CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game&#x27;s speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

The update brings across some snazzy construction parts from Below Zero, meaning you’re now free to trick out your bases with surface hatches and glass domes. Nice. It also sweeps away more than 800 bugs, including ones that affected base building, vehicle navigation, and piloting. Living Large adds an unstuck button to the menu too, in case you get into peril on some geometry below the waves and can’t free yourself.

                              <span>Earlier today, it was revealed that Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion has a piece of artwork in it with a great big Getty Images watermark slapped across it. The eagle-eyed staff over at Kotaku posted an image of the offending painting, found in Nibelheim&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion where Zack and co find themselves toward the end of the game, and having gone back in to see for myself, I can confirm that, yep, the in-game painting of John Crowther&#x27;s Ludgate Circus, London, 1881 does indeed still have the watermark on it. Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a&#x27;knockin... 
Whoopsie artwork isn&#x27;t the only thing hiding in Crisis Core&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion, though, because down in the basement is a rather cute nod a Final Fantasy VII fav. Spoilers within, obvs.

The 7.2: Showdown On Ruhnuk update to saber-swinging MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic has you hunting down a rogue member of that pesky warrior clan, landing/crashing you on a new planet with fresh daily missions and a story questline. There&#x27;s a big PvP revamp, too, along with substantial changes to how gear works.
Planet Ruhnuk is the beigest entity I&#x27;ve ever seen, but you&#x27;re not there for your holidays, are you.

Elon Musk shared his company Tesla’s announcement, via his company Twitter, that not his company Steam was now supported in Tesla’s newest Model S and X vehicles. Do you remember when I-spy was the height of gaming in a car? Well, now you can pretty much play whatever game you like instead with the Tesla holiday update. You can use a controller, but it supports mouse and keyboard wirelessly for that authentic roadside PC experience.

                              <span>A Texas man who sold access to the pirate &#x27;Super Arab IPTV&#x27; service through Amazon and Walmart, is liable for more than $2 million in damages. The default judgment, requested by broadcaster Dish, also targets two Chinese companies. The court also issued a broad injunction that targets hosting providers, domain registries, and other IPTV sellers.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is a rather lovely PCIe 4.0 SSD, offering sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s at a surprisingly low price. The drive was dubbed &#x27;just short of SSD greatness&#x27; on its debut earlier this year, but price drops have brought it increasingly into contention. 
Today, for example, you can pick up the 1TB model from WD&#x27;s official UK web store for £75, down from £91, or the larger 2TB size for £140, down from £181. That beats the Amazon price considerably, especially for the 2TB size which is currently at £178.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of mechanical keyboards, so when I saw this unusual keyboard discounted on Amazon, I needed to write it up for RPS. The idea here is that it&#x27;s more or less a 60% size mechanical keyboard, but with two useful additions: arrow keys and a numpad. This makes it about the same size as a tenkeyless keyboard, but without the (lesser-used) navigation keys. 
Combined with an asking price of £42, down from a usual price of £50, I think it&#x27;s well worth considering - whether you&#x27;re looking for an interesting mechanical keyboard for your growing collection (I see you there) or a first cheap mech to give the whole idea a try.

                              <span>Games get delayed so often that it&#x27;s always a pleasure when a release date is instead moved earlier. Chop Goblins maybe takes it to an extra extreme. The 30-minute retro shooter from the developer of Dusk was due for release on January 2nd, but it&#x27;s out now after being released several weeks earlier. &quot;I was bored,&quot; explained the developer on Twitter.

                              <span>When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game&#x27;s most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn&#x27;t quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you&#x27;re mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they&#x27;ve done with FF7 Remake).
It&#x27;s with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7&#x27;s PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix&#x27;s ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I&#x27;ll say this. If you don&#x27;t already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that&#x27;s received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 struggled to quickly apply fixes for issues with its heroes during Season 1, but Blizzard say they’ve managed to sort all that out for the recently minted hero shooter. A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that&#x27;s not an observation, it&#x27;s an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.

                              <span>Today we reach day 13 of the RPS Advent Calendar. This is unlucky for some, but not for a group of cool, fast movin&#x27;, psyche-battlin&#x27; schoolkids, who spend a lot of time on extra curricular activities and not enough time getting their talking cat to shut up.

                              <span>It’s been 17 years and a week since Brokeback Mountain happened, and indie dev Robert Yang has taken the spirit of the movie and turned it into a free to play romance visual novel. That Lonesome Valley lets you play out the relationship between two young herders working alone together out in the American wilderness. Yang gives a content warning for the game, which contains pixel art nudity and sex sequences. You can watch the first ten minutes of That Lonesome Valley below.

                              <span>The strategic superheroics of Marvel’s Midnight Suns might make it a Bestest Bests winner, but tragically, it does come yoked to the dreadful 2K Launcher. A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns&#x27; stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you&#x27;re playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

That’s what devs Housemarque and publisher PlayStation have listed for Returnal’s recommended system requirements though. Shush, don’t tell anyone, but I don’t have that much RAM in my machine. Doing a straw poll of RPS staff, most of us don&#x27;t. Except James, who&#x27;s looking very pleased with himself right now.

That&#x27;s a nice $69 reduction from its MSRP and an excellent value for a drive of this size and spec.

                              <span>High on Life, a game where you use talking guns to stop humans from being sold as drugs, is the newest title from Squanch Games, a development studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, When I played their last game, Trover Saves the Universe, a few years ago, I was surprised by how naturally Roiland’s brand of improvised dialogue translated to video game form. Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

No longer are my opponents just names on a screen: they&#x27;re now names on a screen who I know have contributed to the 159 million Vibranium cards drawn during the Vibranium Forge event. It&#x27;s neat to see some silly stats, even neater to see a Black Panther with a power level that tops 8 million. A normal number would be, like, 16.

                              <span>You might have missed it in the Games Awards news-glut, but FromSoftware announced a new game last week. Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon&#x27;s Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they&#x27;re treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

                              <span>Football may not have come home this year, but it is coming to Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0. A limited-time mode introduced with Season 01 Reloaded&#x27;s launch on Wednesday will see two teams of three knocking a big football about on ATVs equipped with special pulse abilities, in classic Rocket League fashion. 
The developers are also bringing back Mini Royale, popping up a new building in the DMZ mode, and adding a new map to the multiplayer mode that you actually need to own Modern Warfare 2 for.

Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has confirmed that more updates are on the way, using his Game Awards victory speech to announce that they&#x27;re working on &quot;several more things&quot; for Elden Ring. He also mentioned he plans to &quot;create even more interesting games&quot;, if a triumph like Elden Ring still isn&#x27;t good enough for you.

                              <span>Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent&#x27;s crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I&#x27;ve played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won&#x27;t pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

I like getting a bajillion frames per second as much as the next PC owner, but good gravy, are the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 a pair of oversized, ruinously expensive brutes. AMD’s two new high-end GPUs, therefore, have a golden chance to be the more modestly designed, affordable alternatives that prospective 4K players were waiting for.

After nearly three years in development and releases on Android, Linux, and through itch.io, Unciv’s now moving its units onto Steam. You&#x27;ll be able to play multiplayer Unciv, but that involves using Dropbox for syncing, which isn’t free to use.

You can still unlock 70 of the things via Ubisoft Connect, which launches automatically when you boot the game up on Steam anyway - so the only functional difference is that your achievements won&#x27;t all be in the same place. People don&#x27;t love that, which is fair, but let&#x27;s keep our heads now.

CTV News report that parents of three Canadian children who regularly play Fortnite claim the game was created to be “highly addictive”, and allege the battle royale has caused their kids psychological and physical problems, along with financial issues. Although the families are seeking damages from Epic, no figure has been put on those yet. Epic has 30 days to appeal the case or it’ll go to trial.

Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

Soon after, the music group requested compensation for over $250,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees. Yout has now asked the court to put this matter on hold while its appeal over the legality of youtube-dl-based software is heard at the appeals court.

A copyright lawsuit filed by the studios in 2021 was a clear sign that patience had finally run out and a year later, it&#x27;s all over. A California court has just awarded the plaintiffs $20.7m in damages plus $417,600 to cover attorneys&#x27; fees.

Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!

I finished the Arlong Park arc of the One Piece anime this year and took a break to watch some other shows on my lists and play through some games I’ve been meaning to finish. That’s to say, I went into a hands-on preview session with One Piece Odyssey with just a dash of One Piece knowledge, knowing there are still 1000-plus episodes for me to watch to catch up on the series.

I’ve been excited about Forspoken since its reveal as Project Athia in 2020. The fish-out-of-water game set in a medieval fantasy realm is developed by Luminous Productions – an internal Square Enix team that helped develop Final Fantasy XV, a game I quite enjoyed despite its problems. It also features the talents of Uncharted series creator Amy Hennig and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story writer Gary Whitta on the narrative side, which makes me interested in playing through protagonist Frey Holland’s journey.

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

                              <span>We had snow in Edinburgh this week, so it&#x27;s full-on Christmas as far as I&#x27;m concerned. This tweet (with a clip from cute Christmas romcom A Bride For Christmas, by the way, available on Amazon Prime) speaks to my current professional mindset. I&#x27;ve bought and wrapped all my presents, written and posted my cards, and now I can sit back and continue watching Christmas movies (37 since the start of November). But what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has announced several changes coming to the Pokémon Trading Card Game, starting with the first expansion in the Scarlet and Violet series hitting in March. In addition to the ex gameplay mechanic that was announced for the series in August at the Pokémon World Championships, players can expect several changes to the cards and the packs in which they are housed.
First up, those yellow borders U.S. players and collectors are so used to will become a thing of the past. Starting with Scarlet and Violet, the borders will be gray to match the Japanese cards. The move is said to provide a more seamless experience for the Pokémon Trading Card Game while putting a greater emphasis on the actual artwork of the cards. Additionally, Trainer cards will now have subcategories display…</span>

                              <span>Amazon Basics have produced some great computer gear in their history - memorably, once selling a full-size mechanical keyboard for £23 that I reviewed and found surprisingly good value for money. Today though, it&#x27;s something different: an Amazon Basics branded Micro SD card in a 256GB capacity, selling for just £15.67 rather than its UK RRP of £26.99. 
Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned about the card, and why I reckon it&#x27;s worth picking up if you&#x27;re in need for a memory card for your Steam Deck, Switch or whatever.

This is a good deal for a mouse loved for its high-tech scroll wheel, wide and comfortable shape and long-ass battery life.

The Devil&#x27;s Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a &quot;wildcard condition&quot; called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

                              <span>Your wallet may still be quivering from the Steam Autumn Sale. Tough. It&#x27;s time to grab hold of it again, comfort it with a few tender strokes, then gorge on its innards to pay for some of the splendid turn-based strategy games on sale in Steam&#x27;s TurnBasedFest.
There are decent discounts for Katharine&#x27;s beloved Dorfromantik, my beloved Slipways, and many generally beloved digified board games. Most of the sales end on December 12th, so don&#x27;t spend too long thinking about it. Reality&#x27;s turn-timers aren&#x27;t optional.

                              <span>The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that&#x27;s just my bad decisions talking. You&#x27;re stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It&#x27;s not super secret, but I almost don&#x27;t want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because we&#x27;ve done our own awards, and who needs a live show with a smiley man in clean, clean trainers when you&#x27;ve got a list of the games and things in games that we liked for reasons too specific to get a category on stage? Also, none of them are Elden Ring.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they&#x27;re bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren&#x27;t check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn&#x27;t a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don&#x27;t think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I&#x27;ll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

                              <span>A lot of people claim foisting modern graphics on older games just results in compromising the original&#x27;s artistic vision. I am a chump who likes shiny things, so the release of Portal with RTX on Steam pleases me. It&#x27;s free if you own Portal, but fellow chumps should be aware that it&#x27;s not running too hot for everyone, with reports of crashes and literally too-hot GPUs. Ray-tracing does not come cheap.

How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children&#x27;s hospital.

Not so for Barney Calhoun, who fought his way free of the facility back in Valve&#x27;s 2001 Half-Life expansion, Blue Shift. Modding team HECU Collective have been forcing him to run that gauntlet again, so far releasing 3 chapters to their mod for Black Mesa - not the fictional company, but the very real (and good) fan remake of the original Half-Life.
Chapter 4: Captive Freight comes out tomorrow, so it&#x27;s a fine time to jump in.

Though the TGAs proper were full of big games, names, and announcements, the indie showcase was no slouch, highlighting over a dozen exciting indies. One of the most notable was Spirittea, a life-sim where you manage a bathhouse, build relationships with the local NPCs and help various spirits that only you can see. Sort of a Spirited Away meets Stardew Valley proposition.

                              <span>Earlier this year I compared the MMO Lost Ark to grey carpet, in the sense that the MMO Lost Ark is exactly like a grey carpet: trendy yet drab. At the time I&#x27;d been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year&#x27;s Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, I thought, &quot;Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware&#x27;s use of grey&quot;. Even though there isn&#x27;t a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey&#x27;s redemption arc?

                              <span>Speaking as a grown-ass man, I love trains. Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

                              <span>In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

                              <span>Last night at The Game Awards, we learned that not only will there be a Hades 2, but it will be making the absolutely correct choice of letting Zagreus step aside to make way for a new protagonist. This time around we&#x27;ll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She&#x27;s also Zag&#x27;s half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Crime Boss: Rockay City was announced during The Game Awards 2022 and though its trailer was light on gameplay, it featured plenty of surprising celebrities. Michael Madsen is playing the titular Crime Boss, Travis Baker, along with Kim Basinger as Casey, Damion Poitier as Nasara, Danny Trejo as The Dragon, Danny Glover as Gloves, Michael Rooker as Touchdown, Vanilla Ice as Hielo, and Chuck Norris.
The game takes place in Florida in the 90s and is a first-person shooter. Little else is known about the game, but it releases on March 28, 2023 for PC (via Epic), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</span>

                              <span>This evening’s presentation of The Game Awards brought us a new cinematic look at Diablo IV. The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

Blue Protocol was not announced during the 2022 Game Awards, but up until now, it hasn&#x27;t been clear if the game would be making its way outside of Japan. During the show, a new trailer for the game was shared, alongside a confirmation that the game would be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in new regions the second half of 2023. Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

                              <span>Celeste and TowerFall creator Maddy Thorson and their team at Extremely OK Games teased its next project, Earthblade, last year. Tonight at The Game Awards, we got our first look at what the fantasy platformer looks like. 
From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

                              <span>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor has remained quiet for much of its development cycle, but a leak earlier this week suggested that we don’t have long to wait for the big sequel. That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.</span>

                              <span>Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It&#x27;s called Judas, and if you&#x27;re a BioShock fan, you&#x27;ll be happy with what you&#x27;re about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock&#x27;s footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine&#x27;s work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
&quot;You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?&quot;


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They&#x27;ve been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we&#x27;d see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team&#x27;s first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it&#x27;s nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn&#x27;t have a release window, but it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details). If you’ve been working on an entry for the title game competition, it’s time to finish and submit it! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
