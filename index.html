Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over.

Developer Pmurph Games and publisher RedDeer.Games have today announced that Golfinite, a classic-looking golf title, will be swinging onto Switch on 9th February.
On the surface, this one is all about the basics: club type, swing power, direction and wind speed. Power-ups, fantasy obstacles and intrusive wildlife will also have some sway over the experience, but this is a golf title that is all about the game itself: getting the ball in the hole in as few swings as possible.

Update : The video posted by Universal Studios that showcases Eiji Aonuma and Shigeru Miyamoto has now been taken offline (thanks, Eurogamer), possibly adding fire to the theory that Aonuma was visiting the park to look into a potential Legend of Zelda expansion.
It&#x27;s not concrete evidence, mind, but it&#x27;s definitely suss that the video would be removed entirely. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see what Nintendo says in the coming months - if anything!

There&#x27;s no slowing down for Sungrand Studios. The team behind the &#x27;Silver Falls&#x27; series managed to squeeze in two final games on the 3DS and Wii U eShops before their closure last year and have since announced a host of remakes and remasters to go about bringing these now lost (or region-locked) titles to the Switch.
One such game that is making the jump today is Silver Falls: Guardians and Metal Exterminators S — a mission-based action RPG that initially launched on the New 3DS in North America back in 2022. This is the first time that the game has seen a European release and it has a whole bunch of fresh features to boot.

Within seconds of starting Bahnsen Knights, the third in LCB Game Studio&#x27;s ‘Pixel Pulps’ series of games, we found ourselves inspired. We turned the lights down low, put on some headphones and, with the clear aim of savouring every moment, held the Switch’s OLED screen so close to our face that we became fully immersed in this visual novel’s rich four-colour pixel graphics and oscillating, unnerving chiptune soundscape.
Our slightly obsessive behaviour was no surprise considering how much this writer enjoyed the previous two Pixel Pulps, Mothmen 1966 and Varney Lake, visual novels of genre-defining quality in the most crucial of ways—that they were a lot of fun to play (especially Mothmen). These predecessors were hyper-imaginative horror stories told to an impressive storytelling standard, seemingly inspired by the retro likes of Weird Tales magazine. To our tastes, this series already deserves to be the standard bearer for visual novels as a whole. They’re the kind of idiosyncratic, quality production that can elevate a genre out of what is a fairly small niche.

Developer Blue Firefly Games and publisher Short N Sweet Games have shown off a trailer for their upcoming &#x27;down scrolling&#x27; game Udo (Unidentified Drilling Object), coming to Nintendo Switch on February 1st, 2024.
Boasting challenging, fast-paced gameplay, Udo is nevertheless designed to be completed in around 3 hours or so. Its gameplay is very reminiscent of Downwell in which you constantly drill down to unlock perks, items, and unique powers. We adore Downwell, and looking at the trailer for this one, Udo definitely gives off the same vibes. We&#x27;re up for it!

In recent years, Nintendo has become extremely efficient when it comes to announcing and releasing its games. Tears of the Kingdom aside, there has mostly been only a handful of months between the initial announcement and the release of many of the company&#x27;s major software titles.
The same, however, cannot be said for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced on June 13th, 2017 (nearly 7 years ago), the game&#x27;s development was rebooted exactly 5 years ago, with an announcement posted on Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel on January 25th, 2019 from Nintendo EPD&#x27;s Shinya Takahashi (thanks, Stealth).

Resident Evil and Mario Kart. Hardly the most likely pairing, eh? We&#x27;d be pretty confident assuming that a crossover isn&#x27;t coming our way anytime soon, but if the last few years have proven one thing, it&#x27;s that you can never rule out the hacking community.
&#x27;Resident Evil Kart&#x27; is a new ROM hack from SNES hacker MrL314 which brings the two series together in the most challenging way possible. No, this isn&#x27;t Jill Valentine speeding around Moo Moo Meadows (as much as we&#x27;d love to see that), instead, it takes Resident Evil&#x27;s classic perspective shots — the fixed camera angles — and adds them to Super Mario Kart.

Palworld has been the talk of the video game space since last week and its popularity continues to rise with over eight million sales now. It&#x27;s admittedly drawn a lot of comparisons to the Pokémon series in this short time, and now it seems The Pokémon Company has issued an official statement in response.
While &#x27;Palworld&#x27; isn&#x27;t directly named, The Pokémon Company notes in this statement issued on 25th January 2024 how it does not permit any use of the Pokémon IP in this game and &quot;intends to investigate&quot; any infringement of IP rights related to Pokémon. Here&#x27;s the statement in full:

Nintendo has just released a sizeable update for its online racing game F-Zero 99, adding in private lobbies, secret tracks and much more.
Private lobbies will come with a 4-digit passcode, allowing players to use passcodes to meet in the same lobby race. The new secret tracks will &quot;occasionally appear in the game and some other changes have been made like the increase of the maximum level and skill rating.

The new &quot;open-world survival and crafting game&quot; Palworld has become insanely popular overnight, with sales surpassing the seven million mark and now supposedly overtaking first-week records of games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Of course, there&#x27;s also been a lot of debate about this game online - mostly in regards to the monster designs. While Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have refused to comment on this new global sensation, TPC&#x27;s former chief legal officer has chimed in with his thoughts, admitting he&#x27;s surprised it got this far.

                              <span>EXS to impress.
Japanese developer Frenchbread&#x27;s phenomenal anime fighter, Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late, impressed the heck out of us when it dropped in its final revised form on Switch back in 2020. Nabbing a 9/10 score in our review, it quickly became one of those very special games that we just straight-up refuse to ever delete off our SD cards. Still easily one of the console&#x27;s best fighters, it&#x27;s a slick and addictive work of indie art that only missed out on a perfect score due to some very disappointing online issues. And hey, now it&#x27;s got a sequel!
Yep, UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes (herein referred to as &#x27;UNI2&#x27; because we&#x27;re down with the kids) sees you return to a world where humans ravaged by the &#x27;Hollow Night&#x27; (scary void monsters) become In-Births. In-Births gain the ability to control a power known as EXS, and that&#x27;s how...well, that&#x27;s how they fight so good. We don&#x27;t understand much more of the story in all honesty, beyond this and the fact there&#x27;s a 500-year-old girl named Linne knocking about, we&#x27;re just happy that we understand what the franchise&#x27;s crazy name is all about now.

                              <span>When I sat down at my desk after lunch today, I thought, I&#x27;m just going to give this demo for Balatro a tiny go, just to get my head round its poker-based roguelike deckbuilding. Cut to several hours later and I&#x27;ve had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro&#x27;s demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you&#x27;re into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who&#x27;s never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let&#x27;s face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that&#x27;s turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it&#x27;s coming out in full real soon, too.

This one is actually two separate stories but in a bid to conserve resources and make our frontpage slightly less depressing to read, I am going to roll them together. Black Forest Games, the Embracer-owned creators of the Destroy All Humans! Remake, are reportedly cutting 50% of their workforce - around 50-60 people. Outriders developers People Can Fly, meanwhile, have laid off 30 developers who were working on an unannounced Square Enix game.

Does it contain AI? Did it directly steal from Pokémon? Can The Pokémon Company sue? Probably not. But why does everyone care so damn much anyway? We give our vibes-based takes on the whole affair, which seems to be escalating every day (and will therefore presumably disappear soon).

                              <span>As far as bread goes, I&#x27;d say those unlimited top-ups you get with fancy meals can sometimes supersede the actual meal itself. A little swirl in olive oil and balsamic? Mwah, delicious. For a more regular transaction, I do love a multi-seeded loaf for the added texture. Now, would I say I like bread more than… anime? That&#x27;s tough. But thankfully I don&#x27;t need to decide, as there&#x27;s a demo of a game out right now that combines both interests. In Aeruta you play as an anime girl who defeats monsters and uses their innards to fuel her bakery business. Perfect.

                              <span>Given that Microsoft have spent considerable time and effort becoming the biggest cock-of-the-walk possible, it does, I suppose, make sense that their layoffs are correspondingly massive. In an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Phil Spencer is very sad to reveal to the staff that, in order to grow, the combined powers of Microsoft&#x27;s 22k-strong Gaming Division have to be denuded to the tune of 1,900 human beings. That amounts to about 8% of the division.

Super Algebrawl. This tactical mathematical RPG is the latest from Punkcake Délicieux, the small team behind the roguelikelike &#x27;chess with a gun&#x27; Shotgun King. Super Algebrawl started life as a experiment by one of the devs to help teach his daughter maths, though frankly I think it&#x27;ll teach her maths is cruel. This game and I have very different relationships with numbers.

                              <span>Who&#x27;d have thought toilet plungers would make for such good jumping assistants when it comes to propelling yourself over big, thorny brambles and angry animals? Well, clearly the trio of developers at Phoenix Blasters did, as their upcoming platformer Telmari puts them front and centre as its main form of traversal. Your titular tiny heroine can&#x27;t jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she&#x27;ll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem. I&#x27;ve been playing its Steam demo this morning, and while it&#x27;s a little rough around the edges, there&#x27;s definitely something here for those trained in the Super Meat Boy school of pixel perfect platforming.

                              <span>Friends, it is finally time for me to discourse unto you about my great love of balls. The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn&#x27;t till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. 


Initiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch&#x27;s Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.

                              <span>Graham remarked the other day about how strange it can be to see which indie megahits spawn waves of homages and which ones don&#x27;t, noting that Lucas Pope&#x27;s Papers, Please has surprisingly few immitators. His post reminded me of Pope&#x27;s other hit, Return Of The Obra Dinn. The closest we&#x27;ve come to a &quot;Dinn-like&quot; is probably 2022&#x27;s outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. 
Happily, the &quot;Golden Idol-like&quot; appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life. And I couldn&#x27;t be more here for it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tracking developer Ubisoft Singapore&#x27;s naval warfare multiplayer game, Skull and Bones, since its reveal years ago, both as a massive fan of all things pirates and someone who specifically loved the high seas action of Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag. I wrote Game Informer&#x27;s Skull and Bones cover story back in 2022, and have played the game several times since then in previews, betas, and more. 
Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience. Because I&#x27;ve played so many of its disparate parts rather than the whole, I believe there&#x27;s something really good in the game. However, without playing the full package, it&#x27;s tough to say how it all comes together, a critical aspect for any live-se…</span>

                              <span>Black Forest Games, the studio behind the recent Destroy All Humans! 1 and 2 remakes, has reportedly laid off about 50 people. This news comes from Kotaku, which learned from a source with knowledge of the situation that these layoffs were announced yesterday, January 24, and that more information about them would be provided next week. 
Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, &quot;if not all,&quot; of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

Today, we learned about the most recent instance of this – Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition is coming to PC on March 21. The news comes via the PlayStation Blog, where they revealed that both the base game and its 2023 expansion, Burning Shores, will come to the new platform as a package deal.

Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has announced he is departing from the company; he was not laid off as part of Microsoft&#x27;s 1,900 job cuts across its various gaming divisions, but the timing suggests the layoffs and his decision to leave are at least tangentially related. Here&#x27;s what Ybarra wrote on Twitter: 
&quot;I want to thank everyone who is impacted today for their meaningful contributions to their teams, to Blizzard, and to players&#x27; lives.

                              <span>People Can Fly, the developer behind 2021&#x27;s surprise shooter hit Outriders, has laid off more than 30 employees. This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that its source with knowledge of the situation said the job cuts affected only staff working on an unannounced game at the studio, codenamed Project Gemini, that is to be published by Square Enix. 
Kotaku reached out to People Can Fly after its source sent screenshots confirming that layoffs happened at the studio, and development director Adam Alker confirmed the news. Alker cited budget limitations and a shrinking scope for Project Gemini as for why it was laying off &quot;over 30 people.&quot; The publication notes that another 20 outside of the 30 laid off were removed from the project and moved to other projects at People Can Fly.

                              <span>Earlier this evening, The Pokémon Company issued a press release seemingly addressing the recent conversation surrounding the new Steam Early Access release Palworld and its suspiciously familiar-looking collectible creatures. 
“We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024,” the company states. “We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”
While The Pokémon Company doesn’t explicitly name Palworld or its developer, Pocketpair, in its statement, we presume it’s investigating the record-setting Steam title based on the specified release window and recent controversies surrounding the game’s alleged infringement of Pokémon IP. 
“We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future,” the company states in closing.

                              <span>While we are beginning to see AMD Zen 4C cores in client systems, these smaller cores have already proven themselves very interesting and capable with the AMD EPYC Bergamo high core count server processors and the extremely power efficient EPYC 8004 &quot;Siena&quot; processors. For showing how far Zen has come in power efficiency, I thought it would be fun to show how the original flagship EPYC 7601 &quot;Zen 1&quot; processor with 32-cores / 64-threads compared to Zen 4C with the EPYC 8324P(N) 32-core processors. But as that isn&#x27;t even the top-end Siena part, I also tossed in the 64-core EPYC 8534PN too for a top of stack look for the current EPYC 8004 line-up.</span>

                              <span>Last year, we reported that Twitch was introducing a new Partner Plus Program, which brought with it changes to how streamers are paid. While it was met with some praise, it was also criticized for certain threshold requirements. As a result, the company has implemented a few changes.


In a recent blog, Twitch announced its updated payouts for Partner Plus. For starters, it&#x27;s now allowing Affiliated rather than just Partners to be included in the program. The changes also lower the threshold from 350 to 300, which means more streamers can qualify.




When the scheme began last October, it adjusted the 50/50 split to a 70/30 one, giving streamers more income. Now, with a lower threshold of 100 Plus Point (presumably this is in relation to how many subscribers channels have), a new Level 1 entry point will give content creators a 60/40 split, while Level 2 retains the 70/30 split.


Twitch has received &quot;clear feedback&quot;


Additionally, when the Partner Plus Program (which is dropping the &quot;Partner&quot; from the name) was first introduced, it put a cap on how much streamers could earn. In a nutshell, anyone whose revenue was $100k or more would go back down to the 50/50 split. This idea has now been scrapped.


The program was met with some backlash from the community, many of whom were concerned that the 350 subscriber threshold was unobtainable for many channels. Add onto that the income cap, and it was not Twitch&#x27;s finest hour.


However, judging by responses to its Twitter thread on the news, it seems many are much happier with these new changes that will be coming into effect this May.

In a post on Naughty Dog&#x27;s Twitter, the studio confirms the new documentary arrives on February 2. It&#x27;s a follow-up to Grounded, the making-of for the first Last of Us, and will head to both YouTube and in-game for those who own The Last of Us: Part II Remastered.




The documentary premieres at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET for those waiting on the YouTube upload.

                              <span>Depending on who you ask, indie games are the bread-and-butter of modern gaming, and there&#x27;s certainly merit in that statement, as they serve niches that AAAs simply do not. Take stealth gaming, for example, which received something truly exciting just a few days back: Intravenous 2: Mercenarism.


Those of us who have been eagerly anticipating when on earth might Ubisoft finally announce a new Splinter Cell game may have missed the memo about Intravenous and its upcoming sequel, Intravenous 2. The mostly unknown stealth shooter from the developer HypeTrain Digital enjoys solid reviews, but it&#x27;s the 2024 sequel that&#x27;s really interesting here, mainly because it&#x27;s got a top-tier demo you could start playing right this instant.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s battle royale F-Zero 99 has been around the block for a few months now, but it&#x27;s still seeing steady updates. As of the 1.2.0 update that went live on January 24, F-Zero 99 now includes an easier way to play with friends alongside a little surprise for more dedicated players.


The big feature of this update is the Private Lobby. This feature works exactly the way it sounds; any player who has completed the tutorial can now create or join their own private room right from the main menu. Simply select a game mode, enter a passcode, and you&#x27;re in. 


Your room will auto-populate with CPU players once the countdown timer ends, so you don&#x27;t actually need 99 people to make this feature work. Heck, if you just want to race by yourself against bots, you can do that here.




But what are the secret tracks in F-Zero 99?


The much more enigmatic addition via this patch is the addition of &quot;secret tracks.&quot; So far, it appears that tracks titled &quot;???&quot; will randomly appear as you play online, complete with glitched-looking level icons. The tracks themselves seem to be mash-ups of existing tracks, with similarly mashed-up music to accompany them. Completing one of these will give you the &quot;???&quot; badge.




If you play enough, you should see one of these courses pop up sooner than later. As of writing, we&#x27;re still learning more about how what each of these easter egg tracks looks like.


Additionally, update 1.2.0 also increases the max level cap to 399 (with numbers over 100 being marked with stars), and a new maximum skill rating of S50. Also, most importantly, the patch notes for this update state that Nintendo has &quot;Fixed issues to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.&quot; Thanks for looking out for the pleasantness of my gaming experience, it means a lot!


F-Zero 99 is available now as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service.

The layoffs affect almost 9% of the 22,000 employees at the company. In a memo to staff, Microsoft Gaming CEO claims the layoffs come after leadership at Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard identified areas of overlap following the recent acquisition of Activision, Blizzard, and King.


Here is the full memo Phil Spencer sent to staff:



It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing bus…</span>

                              <span>Torture Star Video, the publishing arm of Puppet Combo, is bringing Tomás Esconjaureguy’s slasher adventure, Cannibal Abduction, to consoles. It will arrive on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on February 8, 2024.


Tomás Esconjaureguy previously brought us The Night of the Scissors back in 2022, which sounds like a localization title for Clock Tower. Cannibal Abduction followed in 2023 on PC, where it was self-published by Selewi, Esconjaureguy’s publishing label.


As is standard for cannibal stories and common in horror, Cannibal Abduction has the protagonist, Henry, breaking down while on a road trip. A friendly local stops to give him a tow, and you know how this goes. Henry finds himself on the menu and has to escape before the meal begins.




To be honest, it sounds rather standard with fixed camera angles, hide-and-seek gameplay, limited inventory, and “soft” puzzle solving. However, the reception to it seems pretty warm.


Speaking of warm reception, while it doesn’t explicitly say it&#x27;s a compilation in the title, Esconjaureguy’s previous title, The Night of the Scissors, is included in the pricetag. The game has you play as Adam, who breaks into an abandoned post office to rob it, only to find it inhabited by “The Snipper,” who doesn’t take trespassing lightly.


It might be worth noting that by Esconjaureguy’s estimation, Cannibal Abduction will take two hours, while The Night of the Scissors is around 40. I generally prefer my horror games on the shorter side, but it’s something to keep in mind when you look at the price tag, which, at $11.99, is a bit higher than the combined price of the games on Steam.


Cannibal Abduction is on PC right now, but it’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on February 8, 2024.

                              <span>It may be approaching nine years old at this point, but fans of Until Dawn may wish to know that Supermassive&#x27;s interactive horror game could be coming to PS5 and PC. That&#x27;s according to at least one report so far.


In a recent story from Billbil-kin over on Dealabs (as translated by IGN), an announcement could be arriving soon regarding a modern port of Until Dawn. It&#x27;s also possible that the rumored enhanced version of the game has been in development for &quot;at least a year.&quot;




At the time of writing, there&#x27;s been no official confirmation from developer Supermassive, Sony, or any other company officially associated with the game. What&#x27;s interesting is this comes just a week after it was revealed Until Dawn was being adapted into a movie.


Isn&#x27;t it basically a &quot;movie&quot; already?


If you&#x27;ve never played the game before, it&#x27;s essentially an interactive slasher film in which you&#x27;re tasked with navigating characters to safety from a serial killer. It was quite a horror hit when it launched in 2015. Sadly, it was only available on PS4 at the time, so a PlayStation 5 and PC version would be welcomed.


We actually think of it as one of the best horror games from the PlayStation 4 era, up there with the likes of Alien: Isolation and SOMA. Okay, some might not be a fan of its minimal interaction – largely reduced to quick time events – but it was offering something a little different in the genre.


As I said, we don&#x27;t know whether there will be an enhanced version of the game yet. This is just a rumor, so hopefully we&#x27;ll get some feedback on whether this is true or not.

This time around, it&#x27;s the Polish team People Can Fly that has suffered layoffs. In an email provided to Kotaku, it was announced that over 30 people will be affected. This information was confirmed with the publication. As other companies have promised during their layoffs, PCF claims that it will aid its ex-employees during the transition. 



In the email, developer director Adam Alker states that the layoffs are due to a shrinking budget and smaller scope on an unannounced game codenamed Project Gemini which is set to be published by Square Enix. 20 people will be taken off the project but will still get to work for the company. 




The layoffs come after the PCF-published Bulletstorm VR which has attracted notoriety due to its catastrophic launch. People Can Fly has released a joint statement with developers promising to fix the issues players have complained about. 


This is far from the first case of layoffs in 2024. Riot has been the most notable thus far, with over 500 employees affected.

                              <span>After plenty of online speculation around whether it would actually happen, The Pokémon Company has released a statement about &quot;another company&#x27;s game&quot; released in January 2024. And we can say what we&#x27;re all thinking: Palworld.


Though the company doesn&#x27;t name Palworld or Pocketpair outright, the assumption is that&#x27;s what this statement is about, unless Prince of Persia has a super-secret stage I don&#x27;t know about. But the statement says The Pokémon Company has received &quot;many inquiries&quot; regarding another company&#x27;s game released in January 2024, and TPC says it intends to &quot;investigate and take appropriate measures&quot; to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property (IP) rights related to Pokémon.

                              <span>Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. 
Reincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.
The shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.


In a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, 
Until service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. 
Former editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that &quot;Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that it will stream full pre-recorded concerts for The Legend of Zelda series and its Splatoon franchise next month. Both concerts were set to be a part of Nintendo Live events in December of last year and this month, too, in Tokyo, Japan, but these events were canceled over safety concerns, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Now, everyone will be able to watch these concerts when they hit the official Nintendo YouTube channel next month. 
More specifically, The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert will go live on Friday, February 9, at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, and the Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert will be posted on February 10. 
Here&#x27;s what Nintendo has to say about each:

                              <span>Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3&#x27;s Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That&#x27;s when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it&#x27;s when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. 
Nintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: 


For the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go &quot;way back&quot; with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina&#x27;s co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. 
With the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It&#x27;s likely Agent 8&#x27;s colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we&#x27;ll have to wait until February 22 to find out. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass.

                              <span>We all know cats have nine lives, but Umbraclaw is on the way to prove they also get successively cooler powers each time they die. The latest side-scrolling action game from Inti Creates (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Blaster Master Zero) is set to launch on consoles and PC on May 30, 2024.


Specifically, Umbraclaw is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. A demo is on the way to the February 2024 edition of Steam Next Fest, and you can see how much ass this little cat kicks in the release date trailer below. 




Umbraclaw follows a house cat named Kuon, who awakens in the Soulplane after dying in our world. In order to return home, she&#x27;ll have to brave this realm of the dead, which has a really cool art style to it. While cats do have nine lives, those lives come and go rather easily. Whenever Kuon takes a hit she dies; simple as that. Thankfully, she has an &quot;Anima Revive&quot; power that can bring her back to life with a new skill each time, paving the way for different play styles and leading her toward multiple possible endings. 


Some of those skills are animal transformation skills like the Crow, Tyrannosaurus, and Elephant (take that, Mario). Kuon can also change into a humanoid form for &quot;full fighting action,&quot; switching the focus from enemy avoidance to direct combat. Blaster Master Zero director Satoru Nishizawa is at the helm for this one, and hopefully, it&#x27;s as fun to play as it is to watch. We&#x27;ll see how the sampler pans out next month ahead of the May launch. We&#x27;ll also find out more about the other mystery game Inti Creates is working on During PAX East 2024!

                              <span>Remember Diablo 2 and its infamously stingy inventory system? Years ago, the classic RPG taught many of us how remarkably satisfying it feels when all of your loot clicks together just right. Enter Backpack Hero: a game that takes this very system and runs —nay, sprints with it.



To be clear, Backpack Hero isn’t the first attempt to make a game out of loot packing. The Save Room games, for example, turn Resident Evil 4’s inventory system into a standalone puzzler. What, Backpack Hero does, instead, is interpret this concept as a full-fledged, deckbuilding roguelite. The result is surprisingly engaging, even if some of the game’s supplementary systems don’t quite stick the landing.

                              <span>Every so often, a game comes along with an amazing elevator pitch but as soon as you jump into it, it becomes obvious why it&#x27;s a bad idea. 


We&#x27;re all capable of well-meaning bad ideas, and Rotten Flesh is one of them. It features a concept that blends genuinely terrifying cosmic horror with a gimmick that should have never made it this far. You find yourself in a strange underground sewer (at least for as long as I played) and complete typical Resident Evil-style environmental puzzles (it&#x27;s even got a typewriter to save!). Your objective? To find your dog, named Roy.


To locate the right direction to travel in (even with a lantern it&#x27;s quite dark) you need to call out for Roy who&#x27;ll bark back in response. As an experiment for how terrible of a gameplay mechanic this is, try yelling out Roy five times right now: I&#x27;ll wait! I&#x27;d do it too but I live in an apartment, and as a society, we have rules.




Raising your voice like this to your dog is annoying in real life and it gets no better when you&#x27;re dealing with a microphone on a controller or the Steam Deck or your laptop that&#x27;s actually hooked up to a monitor and sits under your desk. 


You can avoid some of these problems by pressing a button for your main character to do the yelling for you, but that takes away a key component of the game&#x27;s identity. The aim was to make a sound-inspired game. On that front, we have an amazingly unpleasant title. 


It&#x27;s also worth mentioning how tiring it is to keep yelling for Roy when you&#x27;re lost. I&#x27;d rather use any of my other main means of communication, even eye-tracking as the game Before Your Eyes does beautifully, than yell at my game. 


There&#x27;ll be some who enjoy this title and its uniqueness. I generally like idiosyncratic titles. Give me an FMV or unique indie any day. But not Rotten Flesh. He&#x27;s not a good boy.

                              <span>Yoko Taro’s NieR series has been synonymous with live service crossovers since the release of NieR Automata. Everything from Final Fantasy XIV to Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has seen the likes of 2B make an appearance, so it&#x27;s tragically ironic that NieR’s own live service game, NieR Reincarnation, is closing its doors soon.


An announcement was posted to the official NieR Reincarnation website confirming that the game will officially end service on April 29, 2024. As a small consolation, NieR Reincarnation will continue to receive updates in the interim. In addition to boosting item drop rates and giving out pulls from its gacha every day, the game’s “The People and the World” story arc will see its final chapter on March 28.

                              <span>Say what you will about the likes of Resident Evil 4, its iconic B-movie cheese means it&#x27;s a game that doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously. However, there&#x27;s being flippant about certain aspects of your IP and...whatever&#x27;s going on with this mod.


If you want to see the kinds of things people do to mess about with their favorite games, look no further than Nexus Mods user SupremeLeader777. For some reason, they&#x27;ve decided to take Ada Wong from Resident Evil 4&#x27;s &quot;Separate Ways&quot; DLC and swap out her character model for that of a harbor seal.


Image via SupremeLeader777/Nexus Mods.


If there&#x27;s any rationale behind it, they&#x27;re not saying so on the download page. The images suggest it&#x27;s exactly as you would imagine: RE4 Remake with a seal instead of Ada running (flapping?) around the place.


You can almost hear the slapping sounds


As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s still the same DLC content – still the same game – just you play as a slippery, Arctic mammal instead of the infamous mercenary. If you go through SupremeLeader777&#x27;s other mods, you&#x27;ll see this is not the first instance of swapping the vanilla character out for someone (or something) else. It&#x27;s the appeal of modding, I guess.


A couple of days ago, I wrote about how someone has made it possible to play RE4 in first-person without needing a headset. One might argue this is quite a nifty download for anyone who hasn&#x27;t got – and/or can&#x27;t afford – VR.


That&#x27;s not to say anything negative about the Ada Wong/seal mod. Seeing the silly things people in the community do is one of the reasons I love talking about modding. But now all I can think about is whether the harbor seal speaks in Wong&#x27;s voice, or the audio has been replaced by &quot;arfs&quot; instead.

                              <span>Excitement for Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s upcoming action-RPG Avowed has no doubt ramped up since it was shown off at Developer Direct. Since then, some extended footage has been doing the rounds, with an in-depth discussion about the game from its two directors.


In the recent video from the official Xbox podcast, Game Director Carrie Patel and Gameplay Director Gabe Paramo take us through some moments from Avowed&#x27;s Shatterskarp area. We get a pretty tasty morsel of what&#x27;s to come from Obsidian&#x27;s next release (though it needs to be said that all footage is from the alpha build currently).




The action looks pretty sweet and while the game is not intending to be Skyrim adjacent, I can&#x27;t help but see a little bit of TES5 in all that sword swinging and shield bashing. I&#x27;m here for it, essentially.


Doing what Obsidian does best


While all this high-octane, fantasy action is a key part of the gameplay, there will be plenty of people who&#x27;ll be interested in how well the story will be written (yo). Obsidian is known for crafting rich worlds with great dialogue options, something which Avowed will likely feature.


Remember, this is the same studio that brought us the narrative-rich Pentiment (a game I absolutely fell in love with when I played it). Oh, also something called Fallout: New Vegas. Maybe you&#x27;ve heard of it.


It seems Obsidian Entertainment can&#x27;t do much wrong at the minute. Whatever genre it dips its toes into, the studio often come up with something that has an equal mix of great gameplay and fantastic writing. Win-win.


On top of that, Avowed will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on launch day. We don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s releasing exactly, but it&#x27;s expected later this year.

                              <span>Splatoon 3 fans woke up to big news this morning. After initially being slated for Spring 2024, the second wave of the game&#x27;s DLC is getting a bump up. It&#x27;s now scheduled to be released toward the end of next month. 


Splatoon 3 Sider Order is now confirmed to be heading our way on February 22. It&#x27;s included as part of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass. The pass consists of the already released Inkopolis DLC and the upcoming Sider Order content. The Expansion Pass is currently listed at $24.99.




Today&#x27;s Side Order release date trailer looks like it purposely evokes a Matrix vibe. We see Agent 8 fall asleep on a train just as the screen starts to glitch. It then quickly becomes overwhelmed by falling symbols that&#x27;s quite similar to the Matrix series&#x27; green coding. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see whether the sci-fi series is alluded to any further in the upcoming DLC.


Inkopolis reintroduced the first Splatoon game&#x27;s main hub as an explorable area. There were some minor changes to the environment, but nothing radical. Side Order looks to be a much meatier piece of new content.


Side Order introduces a new location in the Spire of Order. In this single-player campaign, players will experience a challenge tower of sorts. You&#x27;ll attempt to advance through the Spire of Order&#x27;s various floors by taking on wave after wave of oncoming enemies. Nintendo says the new content is meant to be played over and over.


More single-player content for the &quot;superb&quot; Splatoon 3 is certainly something to be excited about. We&#x27;ll see how it all comes together on February 22.

                              <span>Fans of Zelda music, take note, because Nintendo is bringing The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert online. The full pre-recorded performance will be available to stream for free via Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel on February 9. 




According to the official website, viewers who tune into the concert can look forward to music selections ranging from the first Zelda to Tears of the Kingdom, all performed by a full orchestra. The video is listed as being around 30 minutes in length, and you&#x27;ll be able to catch it starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time right here.


This particular concert was originally scheduled to be performed at the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event, which was canceled due to unspecified threats. The event was planned for January 20 and 21 at Tokyo Big Sight before &quot;aggressive&quot; threats were made toward Nintendo staff and attendees. This also resulted in the postponement of national and world championships for Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Beyond the concerts, the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event was also going to serve as a showcase for the latest games from Nintendo.  


The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert isn&#x27;t the only event that just announced its rescheduled plans. The Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert was also lined up for Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO, and now it will stream via Nintendo&#x27;s YouTube channel on February 10. Hey, that&#x27;s two back-to-back days of Nintendo concerts on YouTube! February&#x27;s already lookin&#x27; up.

Prior to the ridiculously successful launch of Palworld, Pocketpair promised a “one year roadmap” shortly after launch. Although this is more of a vague guideline of what’s to come, it gives a lot of hope for the future of Palworld.


At the top, Pocketpair confirms it&#x27;s focusing on addressing &quot;critical issues&quot; with Palworld, prioritizing fixing those problems. This includes world date rollbacks and the loading screen persisting when trying to load into new worlds.

                              <span>Time marches forward, and with it, gaming must also keep itself relevant. A few months back, we talked about how Nintendo was ending online support for two of its now-defunct consoles. A recent update from the company has since narrowed down exactly when that&#x27;s going to be happening.


As of April 8 – at exactly 4 p.m. PDT – most online services for the 3DS and Wii U will be shut down for good. That&#x27;s according to a recent Twitter post, which leads to a customer support page that goes into more detail.




The information says the discontinuation will be for the following: New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL, New 2DS XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, Wii U Deluxe, and Wii U Basic. This will affect &quot;online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.&quot; A second tweet says it&#x27;s possible to &quot;merge your unused Nintendo eShop balance to your Nintendo Account&quot; for use on the Switch. Details about that can be found here.


A number of caveats


While the servers themselves are being turned off, Nintendo does say that players &quot;will still be able to use features and game modes that do not require online communication.&quot; It also won&#x27;t be ending the StreetPass feature for now, as that uses local communication and doesn&#x27;t require online connectivity.


For the time being, you will still be able to update and redownload purchased games, and the service shutdown won&#x27;t have an immediate impact on Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. People should still be able to download update data and redownload purchased software and DLC from the eShop. Again, that can all change in the future.


I was honestly surprised online was still supported for the Wii U and 3DS. The latter was discontinued in 2020, while the former&#x27;s lifecycle was ended back in 2017, almost seven years ago. Shows how much I have my finger on the pulse of outdated Nintendo consoles.

                              <span>The Palworld Steam and Xbox/Game Pass version debacle continues thanks to patch 0.1.1.0 that arrived on January 23. To the surprise of many, including myself, Paldium Crystals got renamed to Ancient Civilization Parts in Palworld on Xbox and PC Game Pass.


To bring anyone confused up to the present, the Steam version of Palworld differs from the version on Xbox/PC Game Pass. Those playing the latter are actually a patch or two behind, even with the latest update.


According to developer Pocketpair, the reason is due to certification requirements. The Steam users are playing, 1.2.0, is still going through Microsoft certification. Presumably, as versions are certified, players of Palworld on Xbox will soon get caught up with their Steam friends.

                              <span>Pokemon has announced that a new set of accessories are now available at the Pokemon Center. The new drop features everything you need to prove you&#x27;re a Pokemon professional. 


The new accessories feature new designs for card sleeves and playmats, including some showing off the Paldean legendaries Koraidon and Miraidon. Fans who have been there since the beginning aren&#x27;t forgotten, so you also get products with Porygon. 


For something a little more varied, grab the products featuring Garchomp, who used to be a competitive titan. There&#x27;s also a Kanto version featuring Fire, Water, and Grass throughout the generations. 


These are far from all the new designs that have been added, and you&#x27;ll have to check the rest out at the Pokemon Center. It appears Pokemon is setting the ground for new players to gain interest, as we also got the Pokemon TCG: My First Battle product to teach players the basics. 


You can look forward to more Scarlet and Violet products, including Paldean Fates which hit stores this week (26 January) as we head into 2024.

Switch gamers can&#x27;t access it on Nintendo&#x27;s console, of course, but with its aesthetic parallels to Pokémon, it&#x27;s been the main talking point for many of us as we await the first Nintendo Direct of the year and the inevitable Pokémon Presents showcase at the end of February.
Palworld&#x27;s well-worn &#x27;Pokémon-with-guns&#x27; descriptor, coupled with a very successful marketing campaign — seriously, it feels like this was Promoted in our feeds for the last decade — has led to downloads in the millions and fiery debate online, with legions of fans coming to its defence from allegations of plagiarism and asset theft. These accusations suggest that Pocketpair — who has form when it comes to making games which look an awful lot like other games — may have taken its search for inspiration too far in this case, with certain Pal models that appear too close to certain Pokémon counterparts to be coincidence.

                              <span>Farewell, friend.
Nintendo has announced that online play for Steel Diver: Sub Wars has been permanently discontinued on the 3DS ahead of the full online shutdown on April 8th, 2024 (thanks, Nintendo Everything).
Now, the service has technically been offline for a little while now after Nintendo commenced emergency maintenance on September 4th, 2023. According to an official post, however, the firm has been unable to resolve the issues and has thrown in the towel. As such, the game&#x27;s online service has effectively been discontinued.

Well, this is a surprise! Out of the blue, Nintendo has announced that the long-awaited Splatoon 3 &#x27;Side Order&#x27; DLC will be coming our way on 22nd February.
This one has been a long time coming. The single-player expansion was first announced back in last year&#x27;s February Direct, and was given a &#x27;Spring 2024&#x27; release window in the September one. Today&#x27;s surprise announcement looks like things jumped forward a little, though.

Before IO Interactive blew everyone’s socks off with the sublime World of Assassination Trilogy, Hitman: Blood Money was widely considered to be the crown jewel of the stealth franchise. In fact, many consider Blood Money to be the progenitor of World of Assassination; a game that thrives on freedom of choice, offering up a total of 14 excellent sandboxes, from a Chilean vineyard to the White House.
This re-release on Switch, dubbed Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, is a straightforward port of the original, retaining the same controls and visuals with slight tweaks to the user interface. What Feral Interactive has done, however, is take a few cues from IO’s more modern Hitman titles and introduce a few quality-of-life updates for players who might not have joined Agent 47 back in 2006.

You know the classic saying, &quot;You wait ages for a bus, then two come at once&quot;? Well, perhaps not, but the point is that less than a full day after ZREO: Second Quest released an orchestral recording of &#x27;Midna&#x27; from &#x27;Twilight Symphony&#x27;, Nintendo itself has now announced that it will be broadcasting a special performance of The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert.
Taking place on February 9th, 2024 at 5 am PT / 8 am ET / 1pm GMT on Nintendo of America&#x27;s official YouTube channel, the pre-recorded performance will likely cover tracks from across the entire Zelda franchise (albeit with a particular focus on Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, no doubt).

It feels like we&#x27;ve been waiting forever for Retro Studios to get Metroid Prime 4 out the door, and well technically speaking it&#x27;s been more than six years since the original announcement. One of the more recent updates was about a company recruitment drive, so what&#x27;s the latest? The Nintendo-focused YouTube channel &#x27;SuperMetalDave64&#x27; has reportedly spotted some new information online related to a new Retro Studios partnership and details about Metroid Prime 4&#x27;s playtesting.
The latest video from this channel sheds light on a new Retro &quot;production partnership&quot; with Next-Gen Dreams 3D - a &quot;triple AAA co-developer production studio for hire&quot; that has previously worked with companies like Ubisoft and TakeTwo and specialises in stylised trailers. It previously worked on a Game Awards trailer for the TakeTwo title Judas. The head of Next-Gen also has Retro Studios listed on their work profile with the date of &quot;September 2022&quot; attached.

HAL Laboratory is constantly pumping out new releases starring the pink puffball Kirby, so what&#x27;s planned in 2024? While there&#x27;s no official announcement just yet, unsurprisingly the company is looking towards the future and may already be hiring for its next big project to follow Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
As highlighted by Twisted Voxel, HAL is currently looking to fill roles for action programmer, UI programmer, graphics programmer, system programmer, sound programmer, 3D character artist, 3D animator, effects artist, UI artist, level design and planning assistant, sound designer and project manager. Phew, that&#x27;s quite a lot!

When an allotment is a bit too cold, or muddy, or expensive, or outside, upcoming gardening sim Peaceful Oasis looks to be a fine digital alternative.

                              <span>Veteran pen-and-paper RPG Dungeons &amp; Dragons is getting its first official virtual reality game. Before you get all excited about being able to let Astarion bite your neck in first-person or shack up with a bear-shaped druid using hand tracking, know that it’s more likely to be a virtual reality experience emulating the original experience of rolling dice on a tabletop. Still, that’s what imaginations are for, right?

They&#x27;re bundling an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, one of the fastest gaming CPUs of all time, with an Asus ROG Strix B650-A Gaming WiFi motherboard and G.Skill Flare X5 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM for just $595, saving $132 over buying separately. 
In fact, if you buy the same parts on Amazon, you&#x27;d still pay $119 more, making this a genuinely good deal.

However, as a fan of mods, I should point out that in many games, being forced onto a new patch might break compatability with a mod which added hundreds of pieces of stunning asymmetrical couture, and the developer hasn&#x27;t updated in years, and might never again. We continue. This week, I ask you to choose between two ways to picking your own level of challenge. What&#x27;s better: different puzzles on different difficulty levels, or bullet grazing?

(It&#x27;s even cheaper than Intel&#x27;s $204 Core i5 13400F, a chip that the 7600X beats convincingly in most games.) 
In the UK, it&#x27;s the 7600 that&#x27;s the better deal, at £189 versus the 7600X at £209, but both are fine value options too.

                              <span>Roots Of Yggdrasil - an inkwashed, roguelikey, card-playing, turn-based citybuilder, inspired by Norse myth - shot to the top of my wishlist after I read Katharine&#x27;s preview last week. And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn&#x27;t one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it&#x27;s a game about being on the run. 


In Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you&#x27;ll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

                              <span>Rival survival sims Palworld and the just-launched Enshrouded are now openly battling for hearts and minds on Steam, and here comes genre supremo Valheim out of the blind corner like, errrr, one of the celebrity WWE wrestlers who hasn&#x27;t turned out to be Problematic - I don&#x27;t know, maybe Zack Sabre Jr? Educate me, wrestling fans.
Valheim isn&#x27;t waving a folding chair or a small flight of stairs, mind you. It&#x27;s holding a development diary for the forthcoming Ashlands update, due sometime in the first half of 2024. The update introduces the titular Ashlands biome, a blend of graveyard and volcano level notable for the presence of burning skellingtons, some of whom emerge from glowering stone totems.

                              <span>Before Doom became the lean, mean murdermachine we know and love, Id Software had far bigger plans for their seminal satanic FPS. Ideas dropped during development include a big focus on story, four playable characters, elemental shields, demonic weapons, and more. The mod Doom Delta brings to life many such ideas from sources including an old design document and leaked alpha builds, which I think makes it fanfic? A new version of Doom Delta launched last week, offering a curious vision of the many Dooms Id didn&#x27;t make.

Case in point: over the weekend, it was discovered that humans, in addition to Pals, could also be stuffed into balls and set to work in your base camp, but now they&#x27;ve only gone and started capturing the in-game bosses, too, thanks to a surprisingly easy-to-achieve exploit involving my bestest of friends, the island police force.

Bizarrely, they also believe they &quot;implemented everything shown in the trailers&quot;. Riiight.

                              <span>I realised several hours into my Enshrouded playthrough that I have an unspoken internal checklist for what makes a great open-world survival crafting game. Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it&#x27;s digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it&#x27;s getting crushed by the very tree you&#x27;d just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.
One paragraph in, and I&#x27;ve already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You&#x27;ll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that&#x27;s both an accolade and a reservation. Because it&#x27;s not quite there... yet.

                              <span>As much as I love looking at and admiring sandbox citybuilders like Townscaper, I am terrible at actually playing them. I get the same kind of blank canvas choice paralysis I do in games like Minecraft, or anything where there&#x27;s no real clear objective for what I&#x27;m meant to be building. I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction. I&#x27;ve been playing its gorgeous little demo this week in between Palworld sessions, and yes, more of this please, this is utterly delightful. Happily, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the final game now either, as it&#x27;s coming to Steam on March 8th.

                              <span>Forthcoming Palworld updates will add PvP multiplayer arenas, raid bosses, Xbox feature improvements, Steam-Xbox crossplay, extra islands, server transfers, new Pals and new technologies, according to an early access roadmap just released by developers Pocketpair. The monster-catching survival sim continues to set concurrent play records on Steam, and Pocketpair are presently focussed on fixing bugs. Beyond that, though, the sky appears to be the limit, as you might expect of a game that shifted a million copies in eight hours. In particular, Pocketpair seem markedly more confident about the odds of adding PvP to the game, having downplayed the idea in interviews before release.

A new trailer release today details how its &#x27;Galactic War&#x27; systems work - that is, the macro-scale conflict within which your missions and bug hunts take place.

                              <span>Some indie hits create a legion of copycats, but others, not so much. I don&#x27;t think there are too many Papers, Pleaselikes, for example - perhaps for obvious reasons given that game&#x27;s grim subject matter.

Lil&#x27; Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It&#x27;s out now.

If so, you&#x27;ll probably want a Mini ITX AM5 motherboard, and this one from Asus is one of the very best available: the Asus ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming WiFi. It cost £329.99 last year, but now it&#x27;s on sale from Amazon UK for just £239.99 - a £90 savings and still £30 cheaper than Asus&#x27; official web store.

                              <span>Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off &quot;about 530&quot; people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to &quot;create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future&quot;, in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The &quot;biggest impact&quot; will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot&#x27;s own intellectual properties.

                              <span>Readers with keen memories may remember that I recently self-described as being in my scented candle girlie era. I&#x27;m currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They&#x27;re just candles of lies.

                              <span>A new update for the PC Game Pass and Xbox versions of Palworld has fixed some of its many, many known issues today, but those hoping for some fixes to its online multiplayer options will sadly have to wait a little longer. Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don&#x27;t have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren&#x27;t having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some quiet time - and I certainly am, because the people upstairs are having their kitchen refitted, and the resulting powerdrill noise is literally shaking things off my desk - I recommend a stroll across the plains of Planetside 2. This might seem odd advice, given that PlanetSide 2 is a shooter in which hundreds or even thousands of players fight each other simultaneously, but the thing about planet-sized wars is that they require plenty of legroom, and the thing about crowds is that you can lose yourself within them.

                              <span>Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it&#x27;s refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word &quot;Mayan&quot; does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say &quot;the Yucatán peninsula&quot;, and sometimes &quot;the mystical land of Jukatan&quot;, which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn&#x27;t make me less sus. I&#x27;ve hedged my bets by saying &quot;Mayan-ish&quot; - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

                              <span>I try to be open minded, you know. What usually happens is I give an adventure game a chance though they&#x27;re all terrible (all of them), and I try. I really do. I made it several hours into Stasis Colon Bone Totem before getting frustra-bored and giving up. That may sound damning, but it&#x27;s actually very good indeed, because usually that happens within about ten minutes. I can&#x27;t say it defied my hatred of the genre as much as a The Last Express or The Cat Lady, but it had a good enough run to deserve talking about. Not least as I&#x27;m still curious about its setting.

                              <span>Ahhh, fast travel: the opinion generator. Speaking to IGN, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno threw his own hat into the ring, saying that he&#x27;s keen to avoid fast travel in DD2 and would prefer that &quot;players travel normally and experience the world around them&quot;. If you&#x27;re someone who argues all games should let you teleport to the objective, then Itsuno thinks you&#x27;re wrong. Hey, he doesn&#x27;t mess about, and I don&#x27;t disagree with him, as long as the game isn&#x27;t actually wasting my time.

                              <span>Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a brilliant foray into turn-based chaos, but some of its RPG elements didn&#x27;t quite lead anywhere. Well, in swaggers the frankly ginormous Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth to tie off the loose ends and give us a follow-up that links all the best bits of Yakuza into a far more satisfying reward loop. Some of the refinements make for superb silliness, while others are a bit eh - not everything is perfect. But spending time with Ichiban and his pals in the sun-soaked Hawaii and beyond is the real treat. It&#x27;s a wonderful, happy JRPG and it will never fail to brighten my day. Thank goodness for Yakuza.

                              <span>For such a ma-bloody-hoosive RPG, it turns out Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can fit rather snugly in the diminutive Steam Deck. Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

I&#x27;m not confident I will best the reaper in Iron Fist combat. But I cannot pass up the adrenally depraved possibility of successfully performing a ten-button airborne combo on mortality made manifest. It would be rad. It would be absurd and beautiful and I know, for a fact, that Death will play as Panda. 
But will we play Tekken 8? Or roll back to Tekken 7? Hmmm. Let&#x27;s find out.

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s Avowed is a game for the more indecisive or changeable RPG player, with no &quot;enforced&quot; classes and an emphasis on easily respeccing and experimenting with different combinations of weapons and abilities. Or at least, that&#x27;s my overall takeaway from a new Xbox podcast interview featuring game director Carrie Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo. In the video, the pair delve a little deeper into last week&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct showcase and how the game compares to their previous Pillars of Eternity games, which are set in the same world.

No, it wasn&#x27;t the option to arm my leaf monkey with an assault rifle, or my green squirrels with machine guns - though they were on the same tech branch. Nope, this one was even more sinister, and I absolutely refuse to unlock it.

                              <span>astragon Entertainment and Mi&#x27;pu&#x27;mi Games have released Howl on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today. It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.


Howl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.




The announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.


There are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. 


I’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.


Howl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.

We&#x27;ve known the character was coming since the Fortnite Chapter 5 launch trailer dropped in early December. But today, we now know exactly what the tactical espionage expert brings along with him. 




With the character&#x27;s inclusion, Fortnite will also be adding EMP Stealth Camo as a new item. It can render players nearly invisible for a brief amount of time. You can activate it as often as you like, though there is a cooldown timer you&#x27;ll have to wait through in between uses.


When the EMP Stealth Camo is disabled, an EMP pulse is discharged that will damage nearby shields and bring any vehicles in the area to a screeching halt. You…</span>

                              <span>After hoping for a release toward the end of 2023, we now know when the Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut will be landing on iOS and Mac devices. 505 Games, the team handling the port, has confirmed the title will be delivered next week. 


The release will make the definitive version of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s 2019 hit available to a substantial new audience.  It&#x27;s playable for everyone with an iPhone 15 Pro or iPads and Macs with the M-series chip. It will be available for download via the Apple App Store on January 30. 




The Director&#x27;s Cut was initially released for PlayStation 5 in September 2021. It was then followed with a PC iteration in March 2022. Within it comes the base game, as well as a new underground factory location, expanded story missions, and various delivery assists to make navigating terrain a bit easier. 


505 Games is publishing the port. The Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is being listed on the App Store for $39.99. However, those who preorder ahead of the January 30 launch can enjoy a nice 50% discount on their purchase. It&#x27;s the first of potentially many future titles that Kojima has committed to bring to Apple&#x27;s platforms. 


Players who own multiple newer Apple products should be aware that the game incorporates Apple&#x27;s Special Delivery feature. This enables those with Mac and iOS devices to purchase the Director&#x27;s Cut once and have it playable across all platforms. Just be sure to have space available, as the Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut on iOS and Mac comes in at a sizeable 69.8 GB.

                              <span>The team behind 2022&#x27;s excellent movie-mystery Immortality is back with not one, but two new projects. Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid have stealthily launched Steam pages for Project C and Project D.


Both projects contain heavy redactions in their page descriptions and info, much like how Immortality was called &quot;Project Ambrosio.&quot; Barlow responded to the teasers getting spotted by accounts like Wario64, though we don&#x27;t have much more to go on now besides the pages themselves.




Project C is the new cinematic... something from Barlow and Half Mermaid, his studio that&#x27;s produced both Telling Lies and Immortality. (Barlow&#x27;s previous Her Story lists him as the sole developer and publisher.) You will appear to do something for the first time ever in a video game, for what that&#x27;s worth.


Meanwhile, Project D is a survival horror game from the Half Mermaid crew. Keywords include &quot;nurse,&quot; &quot;1983,&quot; &quot;nightmare,&quot; and &quot;be careful.&quot; Seems like something worth paying attention to for Silent Hill fans, at the least.


Life preserved in the pictures


Alongside this news, Barlow and co. also confirmed a partnership with Lost in Cult for a new Design Works book about the making of Immortality. All that, plus Immortality hitting PlayStation today, makes for a big news day for the Half Mermaid team.


It&#x27;s interesting to see the Half Mermaid crew tackle two projects, and tease them out at the same time. Immortality was an absolutely captivating game that easily stole a spot in my end-of-year favorites, so I&#x27;m keen to see what&#x27;s next for them. Both a cinematic work and a survival horror effort makes me curious, though. We really only have a few screenshots and scattered text to go on, though. It&#x27;s good fodder for all the House of Leaves fans, I guess.


We&#x27;ll learn more about Project C and D soon, hopefully. In the mean time, play Immortality if you haven&#x27;t, preferably with the lights off and sitting too close to the monitor.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is right around the corner on February 29, so Square Enix is capitalizing on the thirst for more Cloud and Sephiroth with special screenings of the CG-animated Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children film a week ahead of launch. 


Originally released nearly two decades ago in 2005, the Tetsuya Nomura-directed feature is a characteristically over-the-top look at the world of Final Fantasy VII two years after the events of the original game. The film&#x27;s return to theaters is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix, Fathom Events, and Sony Pictures. It will mark the first time for the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete director&#x27;s cut version to hit cinemas.

The screenings will be in theaters for just two days. Those who want to see Cloud&#x27;s Buster Sword in the largest format possible can check out the English-dubbed version on February 21, followed by the subtitled version on February 22. The director&#x27;s cut is a whopping 26 minutes longer than the theatrical release, packing in various visual improvements and around a thousand updated scenes. The story finds a mysterious new illness spreading quickly throughout the world, bringing old enemies back out of the woodwork and forcing Cloud to pick up his impossibly heavy blade and get back into action. 


If you do decide to head to the theater for this one next month, Square Enix wants you to prepare for a history lesson before the lights dim. Folks who show up early will be treated to exclusive introductory content like the history of Final Fantasy VII, how it connects to Advent Children, interviews with Tetsuya Nomura and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, and more.

                              <span>Following some delays, Freedom Planet 2 finally made its PC debut in September 2022, and now it has its sights set on consoles. Publisher XSEED Games announced plans to bring developer GalaxyTrail&#x27;s sequel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2024.


In addition to showing off the four heroines of Freedom Planet 2 and their high-speed exploits, the release date trailer previews a brand new mode. When Freedom Planet 2 hits consoles it will come with the oft-requested Boss Rush mode across all platforms, including a simultaneous update on PC. Split into two divisions with 17 boss challenges in each one, Boss Rush mode will be accessible via the in-game Battlesphere when it goes live. Beating the bosses in both divisions will unlock an in-game VIP room full of easter eggs that long-time fans should appreciate.




XSEED has digital releases set for all platforms, with the Switch eShop release offering 10% off pre-orders from now until a week after launch. The PlayStation release will include a bundle of both the PS4 and PS5 versions, and those who opt to check it out on Xbox will be able to take advantage of Smart Delivery to access the optimal version of the game on both platforms. 


I haven&#x27;t played the sequel yet, but the first Freedom Planet was pretty much the ideal Sonic game I never knew I needed, so I&#x27;m psyched for this one to hit consoles. It all makes sense considering the series&#x27; origins as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame by GalaxyTrail founder Sabrina DiDuro. If you can&#x27;t wait until the console release, you can nab the sequel for the same price of $24.99 on Steam right now.

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting closer to Princess Peach&#x27;s next act on the main stage. Princess Peach: Showtime! is coming to the Nintendo Switch in March, and Nintendo dropped a new trailer today teasing what&#x27;s on the way.


The leader of the Mushroom Kingdom leaves the crown behind and takes on a series of new roles in the upcoming title. Many of which you can catch in the new Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer below. 




So far, we&#x27;ve seen Peach sport several different hats, including a cowgirl getup, detective &#x27;fit, swordfighter ensemble, and even a patissiere costume complete with Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie-inspired designs. 


The gist of Princess Peach: Showtime! revolves around Peach and a few of her closest toads putting on a show at the famed Sparkle Theater of the Mushroom Kingdom. However, shockingly to everyone, some bad guys arrive to heckle the performers and put an end to the show. 


Gameplay-wise, Peach will tackle a bunch of different roles as she travels from stage to stage in an effort to take down the nefarious Grape and the Sour Bunch. Yes, that is their real name.


To squash Grape and his crew, the Mushroom Kingdom Princess will take on numerous roles, including Swordfighter Peach, Patissiere Peach, Cowgirl Peach, Ninja Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, and likely several more that we haven&#x27;t seen yet. 


Princess Peach: Showtime! gives us the Princess&#x27; first solo outing since 2005&#x27;s Super Princess Peach on the Nintendo DS. It&#x27;s one of the better non-Mario Mario games out there. The character is long overdue for a new outing of her own, especially after the character&#x27;s strong depiction in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.


Peach will look to make Grape whine and go home when Princess Peach: Showtime! raises the curtains on March 22.

                              <span>It’s a little less than a month until Pacific Drive rolls out into the world. To get you ready for the game, Ironwood Studios has released a video that covers the core gameplay.


It isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.




Having played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.


I previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.


Pacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia&#x27;s RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.


In a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it&#x27;s a &quot;cutting-edge modding platform&quot; that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.




The above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We&#x27;re already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.


Also comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction


I suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it&#x27;s designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its &quot;level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine.&quot;


We know it works on older games because we&#x27;ve already seen it in action. The software &quot;works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines.&quot; Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.


Whether you&#x27;re sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other &quot;re-&quot; words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.

                              <span>Half Mermaid, led by Sam Barlow, is known for making video games using FMV, and they often require the player to sort through footage to solve mysteries. But for the studio&#x27;s next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid&#x27;s developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called &quot;Project C&quot; and &quot;Project D,&quot; have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here&#x27;s a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

Dubbed Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, this expanded version of the 2005 CG film is 26 minutes longer than the original. Square Enix states it features “roughly a thousand revised scenes with expanded themes and improved visuals.” 
Before the film starts, though, fans who arrive early will witness exclusive introductory content, such as a history of Final Fantasy VII presentation that explains its ties to Advent Children. Gameplay footag…</span>

                              <span>Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

Fittingly, these new Joy-Con are pastel pink, just like Peach&#x27;s signature dress. They will be available for purchase at select retailers and Nintendo&#x27;s online store for a limited time, although Nintendo did not mention exactly when players can buy them. 
And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach. 
Check them out for yourself in the new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer below:

Plus, it&#x27;s ending new game development under its Riot Forge arm, which produced third-party-developed games with the &quot;A League of Legends Story&quot; tag, like Ruined King, The Mageseeker, Song of Nunu, and the upcoming Bandle Tale, which will be the last in this line of releases.

I&#x27;m talking about a full set of 104 double-shot PBT pudding keycaps from HyperX, which combine the excellent legibility of a black backlit keycap tops with frosted semi-transparent sides. This is the perfect pairing for RGB wave fanatics, but it looks just as nice with a tastefully chosen single-colour or other effects. I am a huge fan of these keycaps, and at $12 they&#x27;re an almost essential purchase for mechanical keyboard owners.

                              <span>Double-wide 32:9 gaming monitors are becoming increasingly affordable, which is brilliant for anyone that prefers an ultra-wide aspect ratio but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with the relatively limited desktop real estate of your standard 21:9 ultrawide. 
Right now you can pick up LG&#x27;s 45-inch 45GR65DC, which essentially combines two 24-inch 1440p 200Hz screens into a single titanic panel, for just $550 - rather than the usual $700. That $150 discount turns this into a great alternative to a traditional two monitor setup, letting you have tons of space for getting work done as well as a super-immersive ultrawide gaming experience - just lovely.

                              <span>The Nvidia tools used to create that raytraced Portal mod and other fanciness are now in open beta, inviting all and sundry to jazz up everything from Deus Ex to Garry&#x27;s Mod. Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures &#x27;remastered&#x27; by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn&#x27;t have mod support. I&#x27;ll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

                              <span>Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-collecting survival game Palworld has rekindled the eternal debate over what exactly constitutes a breach of copyright. While the game&#x27;s mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks&#x27; Pokémon games. 
The developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.

Each member of the RPS Treehouse is getting involved this year as well, so read on below to find out what&#x27;s on the Club docket.

                              <span>The next Cyberpunk game from CD Projekt - currently codenamed &quot;Orion&quot; - might have multiplayer in it, according to co-CEO Michal Nowakowski. Please let it be some kind of deckhead &#x27;passenger-seat-driver&#x27; mode, where you get to play a crusty celeb uploaded to another character&#x27;s brain implants, who strolls around the landscape as a hologram, offering passive-aggressive commentary. Watch those corners, samurai! Hey, you missed an ammo pack. SAMURAI ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME.
It&#x27;ll be a while till we find out for sure: Orion is still in the conceptual phase, with CD Projekt expecting to have about 80 people working on it by the end of this year. The higher priority in 2024, it seems, is the next big steaming helping of The Witcher.

The statement goes on to say that they&#x27;re &quot;convinced they will succeed&quot;. Succeed at what, you might ask? Not being shut down by Embracer.

                              <span>For a series that&#x27;s defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom&#x27;s beloved lawyer &#x27;em up. Except poor old Apollo isn&#x27;t really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still the series&#x27; original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo&#x27;s debut game rolls its credits. What&#x27;s more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom&#x27;s first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series&#x27; best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye was caught by dozens upon dozens of spam accounts hijacking the tag to promote cryptocurrency garbage. Twitter&#x27;s journey to uselessness continues. But after reporting dozens of accounts in the vain hope that Twitter might at least knock these particular bots offline (knowing it&#x27;ll never actually address the wider problem), I was delighted to admire a great many attractive and interesting indie games. Check out this week&#x27;s pick!

                              <span>“Most of videogame history is alive and well due to the ability to pirate old video games,” Frank Cifaldi, founder of the Video Game History Foundation, tells me over a call. Last year, the preservation and archival non-profit put out a study revealing that 87% of games made before 2010 are out of print. “There&#x27;s no way to access them without either pirating them or buying antiques from vendors. That&#x27;s a scary place to be.”

                              <span>When Edwin popped the reveal trailer for new Metroidvania Deviator into The Maw this morning, he really wasn&#x27;t kidding about it looking a heck of a lot like Hollow Knight. You&#x27;ve got a small, diminutive hero with a nasty little blade up his sleeve, a haunting and melancholy piano score, a beautiful hand-drawn animation style, and lots of mean-looking creatures to fight. Then again, the trailer also makes it clear there are lots and lots of spikes and traps to navigate here, which puts me more in the mind of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Either way, I&#x27;m well up for another platforming-Metroidy hybrid, and developers Gami Studio have announced that there&#x27;s Steam demo coming in February.

                              <span>When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it&#x27;s among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it&#x27;s doing almost twice the numbers of Steam&#x27;s usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo&#x27;s monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck beta client update is out, and it’s made a pretty neat addition to the quick-access performance menu. A tap of the Y button now brings up a brief explainer for whichever individual setting is currently highlighted, a handy lil’ reference for anyone who wants to customise how their Deck (or Steam Deck OLED) runs without knowing exactly how things like TDP limits and half-rate shading affect performance. Clearly it’s also a brutal attack on the livelihoods of honest hardware editors who write guides to this sort of thing, but whatever, Valve.

                              <span>Developer Rocksteady Studios has pulled back the curtains on the free seasonal content coming to Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League after the game&#x27;s launch on February 2. Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he&#x27;ll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He&#x27;s second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there&#x27;s not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo&#x27;s courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.
The collection includes three games: Apollo …</span>

                              <span>Last week, the internet began to speculate that Gothic and Elex II developer Piranha Bytes was being shut down after fans noticed the studio&#x27;s website was essentially defunct. Many speculated Piranha Bytes was another casualty in owner Embracer Group&#x27;s purge of studios that began last year after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.


Studio closures at the hands of Embracer include Saints Row developer Volition Games and reformed TeamSplitters team Free Radical Design. Game Informer reached out to Piranha Bytes following last week&#x27;s speculation to see if it was, indeed, another closure at the hands of Embracer, and today, studio CEO Michael Rüve responded, stating the studio&#x27;s situation right now is difficult but that people shouldn&#x27;t w…</span>

In an interview with Lucasfilm.com, game director Jerk Gustafsson said first-person was &quot;part of MachineGames&#x27; DNA&quot;, and that the perspective &quot;separates our game from many other action-adventure titles.&quot;

There&#x27;s a slight snag though: New Game+ mode, a staple of both the genre and the series, is this time locked away within the more expensive Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.

                              <span>After saying last weekend that I was aching for the cruelty of snow, I found it. When weather warnings popped up this week, I tracked forecasts and cloud movements for hours before booking a day off work to chase potential snow. When I woke up, it looked bad. Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really.

Sure, that old Phillips screwdriver your dad gave you does the job most of the time, but wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to put it somewhere safe and get something a little more adaptable? 
Walmart are doing a good deal on a Hyper Tough 77-piece screwdriver set, which is $10 versus its regular $16 - a good deal for a set that includes everything you&#x27;d need for PC building and maintenance and has attracted a 4.5/5.0 star average after 245 reviews.

                              <span>Earlier this week I reported on a great deal for the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, a 240mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon US. Today I&#x27;m back with a confusingly similar deal: an all-time low price on the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280, a 280mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon UK. It&#x27;s down to £70 following a 26% reduction, a great price for an AiO that regularly beats less powerful 360mm alternatives.

                              <span>Russian telecoms watchdog Roskomnadzor is reporting a huge increase in the amount of infringing content it either blocked or deleted in 2023. The finger of blame for the 100%+ uplift over figures reported in 2022 can be found pointing towards Western companies no longer operating in the Russian market, but still producing desirable content. According to the head of a local anti-piracy company, Western companies have &#x27;legalized&#x27; piracy in Russia.

During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s rumored N64 version, Zack&#x27;s importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game&#x27;s subtitle. My money is on &quot;Reloaded.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>After years of excitement and skeptism, the Pokémon-like survival game Palworld is now available in early access. The game drops player into a collection of tropical islands inhabited by monsters called Pals that you can catch as your own. Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It&#x27;s a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.
Watch Marcus Stewart and Alex Van Aken dive into the Xbox version of Palworld from the beginning to see how the game performs in its first incarnation. For more on Palworld, check out our recent feature in which we spoke to developer Pocketpair about the studios&#x27; origins and Palworld&#x27;s creation and features.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. 
Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn&#x27;t make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too. For more, check out Game Informer&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 review and see where it ranked in our Top 10 Games of 2023.</span>

                              <span>Last Epoch is gunning for the action-RPG crown long held by Diablo (and recently contested by the likes of Path of Exile and Grim Dawn). With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

                              <span>For a game that&#x27;s been repeatedly described as &quot;Pokémon with machineguns&quot;, the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn&#x27;t already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you&#x27;ll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak&#x27;s catch &#x27;em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can&#x27;t-believe-Nintendo&#x27;s-lawyers-haven&#x27;t-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that&#x27;s not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it&#x27;s a Pokémon game on PC you&#x27;re after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

                              <span>Palworld was obviously destined for success the moment a million games journalists and Twitter users wrote “Pokémon with machine guns”. (Acceptable alternate nicknames include “Eevees with uzis” and “Abras who’ll stab-ya”.) Having finally launched into Early Access on Steam and Game Pass this week, that prophecy has rung true as the monster-catching survival game has caught (ha, ha) so many players that its servers are struggling to handle the load.

                              <span>It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don&#x27;t know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it&#x27;s the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I&#x27;ve been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it&#x27;s trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club&#x27;s dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known about Moonlighter devs&#x27; upcoming RTS tower defence hybrid Cataclismo for a little while now. But now we know a couple more things. It&#x27;s set to release in Q2 of this year, and there&#x27;s a demo on Steam right now if you&#x27;d like to give it a try. Expect to make nice fortresses out of Lego-style bricks, then defend them from hordes of horrors. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a recipe for a good time.

Even as a keen viewer of Leverage: Redemption, I was leery of the heist-o-rama tackling esports. And sure, its fake video game is baffling, but I was surprised by how many notes the esports episode hit right. With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it&#x27;ll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

                              <span>I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I&#x27;ve since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it&#x27;s grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it&#x27;s an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

                              <span>The phrase &quot;best foot forwards&quot; implies the second foot will never be as good as the first, and that&#x27;s unfortunately the case with Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned For Danger. It has a 10/10 pun name and introduces/strengthens concepts that I expect will become series mainstays as we continue with this project, but this is definitely in &quot;difficult second album&quot; territory. I don&#x27;t hate it! But it&#x27;s no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that&#x27;s in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced what&#x27;s coming up in Season 3 of Diablo 4, and underneath the mountain&#x27;s worth of lore and loot updates, there was the surprisingly good news that WASD key controls were finally being added to help provide even more accurate and precise movement in the game over the series&#x27; traditional mouse clicks. Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night&#x27;s Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of &quot;was-dee&quot;, &quot;wased&quot; and &quot;double-you-ey-es-dee&quot; all over the shop as they debated this clearly very &quot;controversial topic&quot; live on air. Read on for more details about what they&#x27;re hoping to achieve with WASD controls in the game, but more importantly: how do you pronounce WASD? Let&#x27;s get a poll up asap.

Enter yet more studio layoffs. 2023&#x27;s trend continues with Dead By Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive getting rid of about 45 staff, per Kotaku, while CI Games has laid off 10% of its workforce, including from Lords Of The Fallen studio Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior studio Underdog (via GI.Biz).

                              <span>Back in the depths of 2023&#x27;s February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.
It struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I&#x27;d like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I&#x27;m very happy to report that it&#x27;s come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I&#x27;ve been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.

                              <span>If you want to change your Destiny 2 wizard&#x27;s appearance, the only current method is to stash your wizard&#x27;s gear in your vault, create a whole new wizard with a new look (after deleting the old to free a character slot, if needed), grab your old wizard&#x27;s gear, then optionally replay any story bits to catch up. The MMOFPS has no barber, no surgeon, it&#x27;s new character or nothing. After six years (longer, if you count the first game), Bungie are finally planning to change this. An upcoming update will introduce the ability to change your character&#x27;s look—within limits. For drastic changes, you would still need a new wizard.

                              <span>After quite a while using the Fnatic Streak65, a 60% keyboard with Cherry brown switches, I have moved on from fruit (technically drupe, according to Google) and into a vegetable era. My Streak&#x27;s brown switches became a bit loud and quite rattly, which, as someone with hearing declared by an audiologist to be so sensitive that I give myself tinnitus, started to get to me. 


So I type this to you now as someone who&#x27;s graduated to Kailh low profile switches, which is proving as nutritious for my finger pads as I&#x27;d imagine its leafy homophone would be. Here&#x27;s hoping that there&#x27;s more low profile mechanical keebs out there in a few years, as the options seem very limited at the mo.

We also got a release window: 2024.

                              <span>I think we&#x27;re well into &quot;milking the gimmick&quot; territory for bodycam horror games now - last week&#x27;s Digested may have been one giant snake too many - but Zoochosis does have the additional virtue of being heavily inspired by the cute doggy scene from The Thing. And also, perhaps, Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s.
In this latest, gruesome escapade from Sparky Marky developers Clapperheads, you are a zookeeper working the night shift. Your job, initially, is to feed the incarcerated animals and clean up after them while giving them an occasional pat on the nose. But Something Is Wrong. Giraffes aren&#x27;t supposed to have that many legs, or mandibles. Kangaroos aren&#x27;t supposed to stick to the ceiling, or have several sets of teeth.

We don&#x27;t have a Nate this week, but James has been playing Apelegs again and offers a surprising self-assessment of how he feels like he&#x27;s past his Apex Legends prime, and how confidence is a really necessary skill in competitive shooters. Worth tuning in for a listen to that.

                              <span>It’s been two whole graphics card generations since Nvidia last tried the whole Super-branded refresh thing, and from what I recall of that sweaty 2019 summer, most of the updated RTX 20 series cards were meek rejigs of GPUs that didn’t really need replacing in the first place. Having tried the new RTX 4070 Super, though, it looks like Nvidia aren’t just redeeming the Super badge – they might just right the wrongs of the RTX 40 family as a whole.

The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you&#x27;re online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above &#x27;Mixed&#x27; review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they&#x27;d just bought for £35.

                              <span>Your favourite beaver-based colony sim Timberborn&#x27;s latest big update has arrived, and honestly, I&#x27;d say your poor beavers won&#x27;t appreciate it one bit. The main reason being, it adds a new ecological hazard called Badwater, that doesn&#x27;t only make your water bad, but your crops and beavers at risk of being bad. Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend they rehydrate with the bad water, though.

                              <span>As we all know, I like vampire stories, and I like different takes on vampire stories. Yesterday Edwin dangled an upcoming visual novel called Vampire Therapist in front of my nose. I am intrigued, also because I appreciate a Ronseal approach to titles. In Vampire Therapist, out on Steam this June 17th, you play Sam, a vampire who becomes a therapist to other vampires. So the title works twice!

                              <span>Readers may remember how much I liked Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, principally because of how funny it was. It was an intelligent and somewhat loving take on a Zelda-y RPG - a small town hero gets a sword and goes on a rampage fighting some bosses - except the main character is a turnip. And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it&#x27;s not quite as funny or as focused, but it&#x27;s also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.

FatShark have detailed the closed alpha for Warhammer: Vermintide 2&#x27;s long-awaited Versus mode, in which the doughty Ubersreik Five go up against four player-controlled Skaven Pactsworn (translation: ratty supervillains) in addition to the rank-and-file AI-controlled rodent hordes. The alpha will launch in the &quot;near future&quot;, and sounds like just the dollop of rancid PvP shenanigans this lapsed Elven ranger needs to re-install one of the all-time great Warhammer adaptations, which unaccountably isn&#x27;t on our list of the best co-op games or the best multiplayer games on PC. You got something against horrible giant rats, Ed Thorn?

                              <span>Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates&#x27; response is simple: churn out more.

It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …</span>

What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

We also learned that it’s launching later this year. EW.com also confirmed that though Harrison Ford&#x27;s likeness will appear in the game, he will be performed by Troy Baker (The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite).
The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery.

                              <span>Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its &quot;living world,&quot; a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players&#x27; decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara&#x27;s Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents&#x27;. The game&#x27;s score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today&#x27;s live stream, is building &quot;Triumphs,&quot; or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016&#x27;s Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its &quot;Insider Program&quot; after release, implementing player feedback.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise&#x27;s history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix&#x27;s excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana&#x27;s combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it&#x27;s due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

                              <span>Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge&#x27;s Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to &quot;craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.&quot; We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses real video games you can play, including our early Palworld hands-on reactions and The Last of Us Part II Remastered review. You might&#x27;ve heard us describe the former as &quot;Pokémon with guns&quot; previously, but Palworld&#x27;s crafting and survival focus make it stand out as its own unique experience. After breaking down the updates packed in with Naughty Dog&#x27;s rerelease, we shift our attention to Another Code: Recollection and Final Fantasy XVI.

                              <span>Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…</span>

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

The publication says its sources pointed to laid-off staff posting about the job cuts on LinkedIn, but has since received confirmation from CI Games.
It&#x27;s currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio.

The publication says those with knowledge of the situation at the studio said the layoffs only affected people at Behaviour&#x27;s Montreal, Canada studio, with those 45 affected let go last week, between January 9 and 11. 
However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio.

                              <span>Bethesda has announced The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a new mobile experience from the team behind Fallout Shelter.
Like Fallout Shelter, Castles is a management sim, with Bethesda stating in an X post that “you&#x27;ll build your own dynasty where every day in our world is a year in the game&#x27;s world. Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. 
Your castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game&#x27;s App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. 
The Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.</span>

                              <span>The Criminal Investigations Department of Nigeria&#x27;s police has arrested five suspects in one of the largest online piracy actions ever carried out in the country. The suspects were identified following complaints from filmmakers, including actress Toyin Abraham who suffered several panic attacks after her latest film &#x27;Maliaka&#x27; was widely pirated.

                              <span>A piracy blocking injunction handed down by an Indian court last September appears to have cost video delivery service JW Player over half of its usual website traffic from visitors in India. Plaintiffs Star India, Hotstar and Disney+ Hotstar, initially requested ISP blocking against less than 10 websites. However, since the court issued a dynamic+ injunction, they were free to keep adding domains, JW Player&#x27;s included. Instructions to unblock JW Player&#x27;s domain were not issued until January 9, 2024

                              <span>A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn&#x27;t have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn&#x27;t do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game&#x27;s logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
