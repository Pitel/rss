                              <span>&quot;Honey, I shrunk the first-person puzzler. Twice.&quot; This is how I like to imagine the designer of Supraworld explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer Supraland, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in an update post on Steam. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019&#x27;s dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a &quot;sandbox&quot; but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel&#x27;s launch into early access &quot;might be in october,&quot; says the post. &quot;We&#x27;ll see.&quot;

Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they’re taking the concerns seriously, and will be make adjustments so that the imagery &quot;clearly reflects the unique identity&quot; of their Warframe-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.

                              <span>Lots of games use frogs as a means to appeal to those who believe they are cute, me being one of those people. The humble croaker dominates the wholesome category, where they take centre stage in farming sims or as detectives or as green lads who hop over platforms and hurt enemies by lashing them with their tongues.
Schim is different: you play as a frog of the shadows, not some green attention-seeker. And in a mundane world of vibrant colour, you&#x27;re to bounce between patches of shade in search of a human pal whose shadow you&#x27;ve been unwittingly severed from. What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian. It&#x27;s a lovely thing, if perhaps not as emotionally charged as it implies early on.

                              <span>If there’s one thing that every Fallout game has taught us, it’s that humans never learn their lesson. As if Earth needed to endure any more nuclear explosions, Fallout 76 allows players to launch nukes of their own and even encourages them to do so. 


While obtaining pre-war nuclear launch codes was a privilege only a few in the world had, the post-apocalyptic wasteland hands out codes as if they were phone numbers. If you&#x27;re looking to leave a radioactive scar upon Earth yourself, you&#x27;re gonna need to know what Nuke Codes are currently active.


Currently active Fallout 76 Nuke Codes (June 24 - July 1):




Alpha: 
803 05 790




Bravo: 
906 90 965




Charlie: 
991 01 593




Nuke Codes reset every Sunday at 5pm PT / 8pm ET / Monday 12am UTC

A CHARMing Set full of whimsical moments


Alongside the shakeup of the champion pool for this set, three all-new characters never before seen in TFT are joining the battle. First up is Norra, a Yordle from Riot Games&#x27; card game Legends of Runeterra. Interestingly, Norra comes paired with Yuumi, allowing players to attach the magical cat to champions …</span>

                              <span>For reasons unknown, one of the video game modding community&#x27;s most popular hobbies is forcing the most random of machines to play the classic DOOM.


For reasons also unknown, I really like this dumb, complex, and mostly fruitless trend, so let&#x27;s look at some of the weirdest places you can play DOOM thanks to some geniuses with a love for the game and some free time.


DOOM on Fortnite




Unreal Engine developer Jackson Clayton came up with a version of DOOM that runs inside Fortnite and even features Fortnite&#x27;s construction mechanics. You&#x27;re not just playing a version of DOOM inside Fortnite — you&#x27;re playing as the original Doom guy as if he&#x27;d been abducted and forced to survive on the Battle Royale Island.


The most beautiful part is the awkward gameplay, which really brings home the …</span>

                              <span>Riot Games’ Valorant offers players the ability to hold their weapons in either of the hands of the Agents. The default orientation features right-handed handling of weapons, abilities, and ordinances. However, players do have the option to opt for the left-handed view as well.


Whether this leads to any improvements in gameplay or not, is up for debate but it’s nice to have the choice in Valorant nonetheless. Anyway, if you’re willing to give the left-handed view a go, here’s how to switch to left-hand in Valorant:



Start Valorant.


Head to the Settings option by clicking the gear icon present in the top-right corner of the screen.


In the General tab, scroll down to the Other section.


Navigate to the &quot;First Person Handedness&quot; and click on Left.

That’s all you have to do in order to hold the weapons in the left hand instead. You can also switch hands during a match by heading to Settings and following the above steps.


The right-hand orientation has been around in shooter games for so long, that even to a completely left-handed person such as myself, the idea just felt off when I tried it in Valorant and Counter-Strike. It is perhaps just down to what we have practised with and are familiar with, just like how we left-handed folks are used to having the mouse on the right in PC setups.


So, if the orientation seems natural, that’s great, but you can always go back to the right-handed mode. Just follow the same steps listed above and choose Right in the “First Person Handedness” section.

                              <span>Movement in The First Descendant is a little more robust than one would think. There are Descendant-specific traversal powers, rolls, and even a double jump. However, the one with the most potential is the grappling hook. On its own, it&#x27;s fun but limited. Fortunately, this looter shooter is all about customization, and things change once you get the Mid-Air Maneuvering Mod. 


Time to give the Vulgus the Levi Ackerman Special


While it is possible to craft the Mid-Air Maneuvering Mod, crafting results are a bit random. Thankfully, the Mod can be farmed by running The Haven dungeon in Haigos on Hard Mode. With Nexon listening to fans and adding matchmaking to Hard Mode activities, it&#x27;s a breeze finding a group and plowing through this instance.

There are numerous benefits that make obtaining the Mid-Air Maneuvering Mod worthwhile. The first and greatest is that you no longer need to target a grapple point. Instead, you can latch onto anything, including the air itself! Combined with the longer range, combat and traversal become a lot more fluid and make it easier to adapt to whatever situation you find yourself in.


While it has a not-insignificant Charge Time at the start, the Mod can be enhanced to be much more tolerable. As an added bonus, a fully enhanced Mod will increase your overall maximum Module capacity by 10. So, not only do you become more nimble, but you can stack more mods on your Descendant, making them more able to tackle content like Hard Mode instances and Colossi.


Since acquiring the Mid-Air Maneuvering Mod, it&#x27;s never left my Mod slots. With The First Descendant punishing Descendants that aren&#x27;t Ajax for getting too close, I don&#x27;t see a benefit for using other Mods in that slot, as the bulk of them change your melee strike. Ultimately, it&#x27;s up to you and your play style, but for my money, this Mod can&#x27;t be beaten.

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was a surprise drop during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct. A brand-new adventure reimagined in the style of 2019&#x27;s Link&#x27;s Awakening remake, fans were stoked to discover players would control the franchise&#x27;s titular Princess Zelda rather than longtime hero Link. 




But Link may not be completely out of the picture. The game&#x27;s ESRB rating has been revealed, and while it is not a surprise rating (a fairly standard E 10+, for Fantasy Violence), the description does seem to reveal that Link will be playable after all.

                              <span>There is no shortage of items, components, and gear in The First Descendant. As you work through the campaign, you&#x27;ll find yourself inundated with a bevy of weapon types, Reactors, and External Components. Weapons can eventually be upgraded, but can the same be said about the Reactors and External Components, particularly the Ultimate gold ones?


Surely, my hoarding will pay off once I reach the end game


There are three rarities when it comes to gear in The First Descendant: Standard (blue), Rare (purple), and Ultimate (rare). The gold rarities provide a considerable upgrade over its counterparts, and the Reactors and External Components will drop in the wild and don&#x27;t require crafting. Another difference between the weapons and other gear is that Reactors and External Components cannot have their level increased.


Screenshot by Destructoid


As such, keeping any that aren&#x27;t beneficial to you doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. Dismantle any Reactors and External Components, regardless of quality, that are no longer of use. Despite the game warning you not to do this, they&#x27;ll break down into useful crafting components. 


While there isn&#x27;t any way to increase the level of Reactors and External Components, you can upgrade Reactors twice in Albion. Ultimate Reactors can be upgraded twice for (15) Precise Ion Accelerators and provide about 700 increased Skill Power. While Rares can be upgraded, the drop rate for Ultimates isn&#x27;t so poor that you should spend precious resources on them. So, hold out for the Ultimate Reactors that work best for your Descendant and their build, and don&#x27;t fret about dismantling those that have outlived their usefulness.

                              <span>Scarlet Rot is one of the rarest status effects that players can find on weapons in Elden Ring. The Scarlot Rot weapons tend to be underwhelming, and very few builds come along that use any of them. However, the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC introduced the Poleblade of the Bud halberd which has piqued the community&#x27;s interest. This guide will tell you everything you need to know to get your hands on the Poleblade of the Bud and how to use it effectively. 


How to get the Poleblade of the Bud in Elden Ring


The Poleblade of the Bud is a remembrance weapon in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. As such, obtaining the weapon requires defeating a Legend Boss known as Romina, Saint of the Bud found at the Church of the Bud.

To progress the main quest of Shadow of the Erdtree, players will have to defeat Romina. So regardless of the decisions you&#x27;ve made thus far, you won&#x27;t miss out on obtaining the Remembrance of the Saint of the Bud.

How to use the Poleblade of the Bud in Elden Ring


The Poleblade of the Bud is a halberd that comes loaded with the skill: Romina&#x27;s Purification. Similar to wide swoop attacks such as Loretta&#x27;s Slash, this skill attacks twice and inflicts a large amount of Scarlet Rot on opponents. It&#x27;s easy to land but is quite an expensive skill to spam. 


Here are the base stats for the Poleblade of the Bud in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree:

                              <span>Consumable items are some of the most underrated features of Elden Ring (and perhaps all FromSoftware games). Players commonly overlook these items since the buffs they grant have short durations and aren&#x27;t convenient to use in the middle of combat. But if you put forth the extra effort to craft these items, the game can become much less daunting than it would be otherwise. 


Shadow of the Erdtree introduces the strongest damage resistance consumables in the game. Seven volumes of Forager Brood Cookbooks teach the recipes of the new line of defensive consumables along with two utility items. If you want to increase your survivability in Elden Ring (who doesn&#x27;t?), this guide will go over how to get each of the Forager Brood Cookbooks and the recipes they unlock.

                              <span>Endgame, aka Futties season, is here in EA FC 24, and things are already looking pretty different in Ultimate Team.


The Futties season is all about extremely strong items with very high overall ratings. We already have a 99-rated Lionel Messi Team of the Tournament card, and there will be plenty of such cards appearing over the next few months. Naturally, these cards open up chances for certain formations to dominate the meta and win more games. The choices are clear - the 4321 and the 541 are clear frontrunners as the best EA FC 24 offensive and defensive formations, respectively.


Best EA FC 24 formation for Season 8


The 4321 has been a top-tier formation since the moment EA FC 24 was released back in September 2023. Since then, new promo cards in Ultimate Team have already made the…</span>

You meet him as he&#x27;s providing backup to two incredibly capable Agents, Anby and Nicole, and he never really moves out of that background role. But his importance comes through in his personality, the way he never hides who he is, and the comedic relief he&#x27;s always on-hand to provide without lowering the tone. 


Surprisingly, I&#x27;ve been unable to find a decent source on who the English voice actor for Billy Kid is. I&#x27;ve seen some fans say they think it&#x27;s Troy Baker, while others are leaning toward Clifford Chapain, though there&#x27;s little evidence for either. Whoever it is, between their voice and the writing for the character, I can&#x27;t think of Billy Kid as anything other than a more whol…</span>

                              <span>There are a lot of video game awards and most of them are simply popularity contests, and therefore also stinky borefests. The one that isn&#x27;t, in my eyes, is the yearly Independent Games Festival awards - the IGFs.

Welcome, one and all, to this week&#x27;s edition of Box Art Brawl! Wait, are we... poets??
Last time, we pitted two covers for the NES&#x27; Urban Champion against each other and after a weekend of voting, it was North America that came up with the win. The classic pixel art cover took 59% of the vote, while Europe and Japan&#x27;s colourful alternative was left with the remaining 41%.

Square Enix surprised Switch owners in more ways than one when it dropped cloud versions of the Kingdom Hearts series on the hybrid system a few years back. If you still haven&#x27;t played these games, and are wondering where exactly to start, Square Enix is now offering two suggestions following the recent Steam release.

If NBA 2K follows the same pattern as the last few years, the ratings should be revealed before the game goes live on September 6. When the ratings will be revealed remains unknown as of the time of this writing. However, what if we were to predict what the top 50 superstars could look like at launch? After all, they have had plenty of ups and downs during the recently concluded NBA season. 


NBA 2K25 Top 50 player overall ratings (predictions)


For starters, the top 50 of my list includes names based on how they may appear in NBA 2K25 in terms of overall ratings. Hence, a superstar who might have been among the top 50 ratings in NBA 2K24 might not be found in this list.

                              <span>Fiberglass is a commonly used material in armor, energy weapons, and various workshop items in Fallout 76. Stockpiling a large amount of Fiberglass is necessary if you plan on building some of the most useful C.A.M.P. items in the game. Besides its crafting purposes, players will occasionally receive a Seasonal Challenge to scrap items into Fiberglass. 


Whether you&#x27;re farming fiberglass to create the C.A.M.P. of your dreams or to knock out the Seasonal Challenge, you&#x27;ll want to know what the best items that scrap into Fiberglass are. This guide will identify the best Fiberglass items and the most efficient farming locations for each.

                              <span>In NBA 2K24, scoring baskets from the tricky spots can often make the difference, and knowing how to set a screen is crucial. 


In easier difficulties, it&#x27;s pretty simple to score the baskets. As you face more challenging opponents, the open spaces on the court reduce drastically, minimizing the chances of scoring a basket. When you call for a screen, it signals one of your players to come short and create space for your ball handler. This extra space, when done at the right moment, can catch the opposition defense off guard. 


How to call a screen in NBA 2K24


You have two options when trying to set up a screen - call a random player or call a specific player. If you go for the first option, the game will automatically consider a suitable screen. This process might be the less efficien…</span>

                              <span>2024 has proven a trim year for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with both screens big and small having little to offer from the franchise. Thankfully, the one and only theatrical outing for the year, Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, doesn&#x27;t appear to take that status lightly. As evidenced by the film&#x27;s promotional material, Marvel fans are in for a wild, profanity-laden, Multiverse-exploring adventure with the Merc with a Mouth (Ryan Reynolds) and his not-so-close friend, if you can call him a friend at all, Logan (Hugh Jackman).


Overall, Deadpool &amp; Wolverine contains a lot of moving parts. As noted previously, it&#x27;s a Multiverse story at its core, meaning that it will likely take audiences across different universes and beyond as the narrative unfolds. It&#x27;s also more of a formal introduction of the …</span>

                              <span>Are you tired of regular Horror and looking for some extra flavor? Then it&#x27;s perhaps time you give Fantasy Horror a try, the genre that imbues all things nasty with all things magical — but only to make it all even scarier — and sometimes a bit sexier.


Let&#x27;s look at the best Fantasy Horror books you can read to get into the genre.

The King in Yellow (Robert W. Chambers)


The King In Yellow is one of the best introductions to the world of horror fantasy that anyone can ask for. It tells not one story, but nine which were highly influential to most other Fantasy and Non-Fantasy Horror writers that came after.


While not every single story contained in this book fits in the horror genre, most really do, and the one that does not will actually feel like a nice palate c…</span>

Whether you’re settling deep space colonies or building the Luna Metropolis, the added maps and game mechanics of the expansions bring additional layers of depth and chaos to the original board game.

In this guide, you’ll find a complete breakdown of the game’s add-ons listed in the suggested purchasing order.

                              <span>When it comes to both science fiction and fantasy, authors have a habit of writing multi-book epics rather than single, one-time books. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a standalone sci-fi tale to enjoy and don&#x27;t want to have to invest in multiple books, these are some of the best to pick up.


I will admit that I love a good series of science fiction books, be it the huge Culture series by Iain M Banks or the two-part space operas of Peter F Hamilton&#x27;s Pandora collection. However, sometimes, it is nice to have a single book that tells the whole story. Every sci-fi adventure doesn&#x27;t need to be thousands of pages long. So, I have dug through my libraries to find some of the best standalone science fiction books I can think of.

The achievement doesn&#x27;t offer any particular rewards other than 10 achievement points for your warband. And the satisfaction of knowing more about this world than everyone else! While there are no strict requirements for finding these items, Azj-Kahet can prove particularly dangerous to lower-level characters. Either go level up or have a good escape plan ready.

The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien)


While we cannot unsee The Lord Of The Rings as a trilogy nowadays, the whole thing was conceived as one single story. Good, because even though you&#x27;d still have an explosion of enjoyment in your brain by reading just one of the books — especially if it&#x27;s your first contact with the series — LOTR is bigger than the sum of its parts.

To get the card, you won&#x27;t have to open any packs. Instead, just complete all the tasks that are part of his SBC. Rudiger and Germany might have fallen short at home in the Euros, but he was consistent with his performances. Had Germany not messed up their offensive chances against Spain, Rudiger could have been playing in the final on Sunday.

There are thousands of graphic novels to choose from, ranging from the space-faring to the gritty streets of cyberpunk. I will try to include something for everyone, but each will undoubtedly be worth a read.


Several of these authors have multiple works that could be considered for this list. Jodorowsky, K. Vaughn, Moore, and others have amazing works to check out in the same genre. So, if you like the ones on this list, make sure to dig into their other beautiful and thought-provoking science fiction graphic novels.

                              <span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is currently at the peak of its popularity and shows no signs of slowing down. The brand isn&#x27;t merely unstoppable on the plane of tabletop RPGs but also doing incredibly well on even the most unlikely of entertainment fronts. 


Critical Role, a show composed of very long episodes where you watch a party play the classic board game while embodying their characters, is one of the biggest things ever on Twitch. The people behind Stranger Things, one of the most successful TV series ever, don&#x27;t even bother hiding that they borrow more lore straight out of D&amp;D than they create their own. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is basically a video game adaptation of the tabletop RPG — well, do I even need to talk about its success?

                              <span>N.K. Jemisin&#x27;s The Broken Earth series is a fantastic look at a civilization thousands of years into the future, sparked by events that leave an entire planet completely broken and covered in ash, creating an entirely new season. 


What sets The Broken Earth series apart is that it toes the line between sci-fi and fantasy. I always love books that do this because science was deemed magic for so long in our history until it was understood. When you take that idea and apply it to the future, though, it seems so much scarier. That&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ll find in this series, which consists of a main trilogy and a side story to enhance your understanding of the world.

I have gathered the following tracks from my own personal exploration into the topic, and from popular discourse about the subject, allowing this list to be full of some of the best recommendations for music for sci-fi reading.

Announced back in 2021 and initially due to arrive alongside a gamer-focused streaming service called Binge in 2022, the live action series has been scrapped along with the production company behind it.

Perhaps of greater significance is that the Driver series itself might not be dead, as a Ubisoft spokesperson said that they are &quot;actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise&quot;.

Can you believe we&#x27;re basically in the middle of July already? Madness... Well anyway, days of the year be damned, it&#x27;s time to play some games.

                              <span>Concord is in beta this weekend and Alex Van Aken and I decided to jump in, play a few rounds, and figure out which characters we liked from the impressive roster. Together we discovered that Lennox, the hot sauce eating green man seen in the game&#x27;s trailer shouts &quot;exploding knife!&quot; when he throws his exploding knife, but he had nothing on It-Z who had a great SMG, the ability to clone herself when she dodges, and teleportation ability making her easily and indisputably the best character in the game. Alex also liked Duchess. You can check out the archive of the full stream below.


For a while lot more on Concord, which releases on PlayStation 5 and PC August on August 23, head here to read about how it plays like Destiny meets Overwatch.

In its fifth major expansion, Dawntrail, Final Fantasy XIV is facing its biggest existential crisis yet: where does your story go now that its 10-year A-plot is over? Dawntrail forges ahead with an enjoyable summer adventure to the land of Tural, doubling as a trojan horse for what lies in store for the future of the long-running MMO’s story. Dawntrail doesn’t match the narrative highs of the previous pair of expansions and is flawed in several ways, but its themes of legacy, the importance of culture, and responsible…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo added three new games to its Game Boy Advance Nintendo Switch Online library, and though none of the them are Mother 3 (or a Pokémon game or Astro Boy or Drill Dozer or any other GBA game we&#x27;ve been clamoring for) they are none-the-less interesting and completely unexpected.
Starfy isn&#x27;t a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.


Are you planning on booting up these classic-outside-of-America platformers?</span>

                              <span>This week AWS announced that Graviton4 went into GA with the new R8G instances after Amazon originally announced their Graviton4 ARM64 server processors last year as built atop Arm Neoverse-V2 cores. I eagerly fired up some benchmarks myself and I was surprised by the generational uplift compared to Graviton3. At the same vCPU counts, the new Graviton4 cores are roughly matching Intel Sapphire Rapids performance while being able to tango with the AMD EPYC &quot;Genoa&quot; and consistently showing terrific generational uplift.</span>

Canari Games, the studio behind 2023&#x27;s fantastic cinematic platformer Lunark, revealed an adorable Link&#x27;s Awakening-inspired adventure earlier this year. Back then, the game was only confirmed for PC, but today, the developer has revealed that the game is indeed coming to Switch — and soon!
Castaway launches on Nintendo Switch and all other platforms on 16th August 2024 and will only set you back USD $7.99 / GBP £6.99. In the game, you play as Martin, an adventurer who crash-lands on an island. His pet soon gets kidnapped (pet-napped?) and he has to go and save him.

Persona has become one of the most recognisable RPG series of the modern era. Starting life as a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off in 1996 with Revelations: Persona on PS1, Persona took a while to reach a wider audience. A shift in tone, some more slice-of-life and school elements, and a gradual upgrade and explosion in style and aesthetics put Atlus&#x27; turn-based RPG series on the map. It&#x27;s far eclipsed SMT in popularity nowadays, with Persona 5 being one of the most recognisable games in the genre.
While Shin Megami Tensei has a storied history with the Big N, Persona took much longer to make the jump to Nintendo systems. A few years of spin-offs on the 3DS and Switch paved the way for Persona 5 Royal and, eventually, the other &quot;modern&quot; Persona games to come to Switch.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s out now.
ININ Games has brought us a digital release of the third game in TAITO&#x27;s Bubble Bobble series — Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III. The game launched on the Switch eShop yesterday, 11th July 2024, and marks the first time the game has been ported to modern consoles.
This modern port of the 1991 classic has many things going for it — it&#x27;s an important piece of game history preserved for modern audiences, and it has save states, rewind, and visual enhancements. But, most importantly, it&#x27;ll only cost you USD $9.99 / GBP £8.99.

GameMill Entertainment has announced The Karate Kid: Street Rumble, a 16-bit pixel art beat-em-up starring several playable characters from the classic movie franchise. It&#x27;s launching for the Nintendo Switch on 20th September 2024.
Now, we know what you&#x27;re thinking... GameMill, ew, right? The publisher has garnered a bit of a foul reputation over the years, putting out frankly dreadful games like The Walking Dead: Destinies and Skull Island: Rise of Kong. But y&#x27;know what..? This one doesn&#x27;t look too bad. Looks pretty decent, actually.

While it might still feel like a long way off, we are rapidly approaching the release of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom on 26th September. We&#x27;re so close, in fact, that the pre-order bonuses are starting to pop up.
My Nintendo Store UK has today revealed its offering and while the extra goodies and bundles might not be quite as impressive as the figurine frenzy that we saw for Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD, there&#x27;s still a nice bit of Zelda merch that you can get your hands on.

Have you picked a place you&#x27;d reserve for the day? That&#x27;s the question Nintendo asked leading up to the Splatfest, which begins on 13th July (or 12th July for those in North America). So you&#x27;re either Team Palace, Team Theme Park, or Team Beach. And don&#x27;t forget the customary new artwork to accompany the Splatfest.

With all three GBA Starfy games — which were originally released only in Japan — now available to play on Switch with a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription, we&#x27;re updating and republishing this brief introduction to the little star which originally went live a whopping 15 years ago. Enjoy!

Since many gamers outside of Japan are not terribly familiar with the Densetsu no Starfy series of games (the Nintendo DS&#x27; The Legendary Starfy is the only entry so far to have been released in the West), we thought it would be fun to take a look at the history of the series, complete with some fun facts that might surprise even veteran fans.

                              <span>Adult entertainment conglomerate Aylo, the parent company of PornHub, has booked a significant victory in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by a subsidiary at a California federal court. A broad permanent injunction against video platform Goodporn requires third-party services, including domain registries, Internet providers and search engines, to block the pirate site&#x27;s domain names. Goodporn, meanwhile, is taking countermeasures.

                              <span>The company tasked with running Piracy Shield, Italy&#x27;s controversial IPTV-blocking system, is looking for a new recruit. The successful candidate will spend weekdays, plus an hour during most weekends, monitoring pirate streams and then taking them down. Surprisingly, the job requires no experience and no in-depth skills, although knowing what an IP address does will be seen as a positive.

                              <span>Gaming hardware makers have often walked the line between enabling a player’s true skills, and simply delivering them an unfair advantage. Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are falsely accused of being cheating tools; other times, a monitor will straight-up play League of Legends for you. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting declaring in no uncertain terms that &quot;Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap.&quot; Cool, glad that’s cleared up.

                              <span>In theory I&#x27;m down to review Breachway, a roguelike deck-building space sim which is sort of FTL but 3D and with cards. The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn&#x27;s resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse&#x27;s atypically forgiving, when-it&#x27;s-ready approach to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

This rampant enthusiasm for teledoors might seem strange, given that video games are make-believe worlds held together by arbitrary squiggles of magic language. There is fundamentally no reason any video game door should obey the customary laws of spacetime. But don’t let that stop you watching the announcement trailer for Motion Blur’s Black State, a third-person stealth shooter which is heavily redolent of Metal Gear Solid but also, awash with doors that work in mysterious ways.

Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game&#x27;s developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details - or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than those of the many other developers who collect your personal information.

Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it&#x27;s not an action game. Also, I don&#x27;t know how to make games. Also it&#x27;s Friday and I&#x27;m tired. Also, AGM isn&#x27;t out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!

                              <span>Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (crowdfunding allowing) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original Soul Reaver. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain precisely once. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.

This is not all-encompassing. Rather, it&#x27;s more a conversation about this year&#x27;s early standouts and other releases we plan to visit before our official Game of the Year discussions in December. Before we properly dive in, Marcus breaks down his review of Anger Foot, developer Free Lives&#x27; new first-person shooter. Afterwards, Alex highlights a small desktop game (literally) called Rusty&#x27;s Retirement. We hope you enjoy this episode and find new games to play!

Anger Foot exemplifies a simple idea executed to the nth degree. As a furious sneakerhead possessing seemingly the deadliest legs in the world, you must retrieve your prized collection of stolen footwear by kicking everything in sight. The bombast accompanying this wacky premise – fast-paced, split-second action, satisfying gunplay, and delectable destructibility – turns Anger Foot from a one-kick pony into one of the year’s most exciting, challenging, and tough-to-put-down adrenaline rushes.

                              <span>Planet Coaster 2 arrives later this year and its big update, alongside all the rollercoaster and theme park simulation gameplay of the first title, is the inclusion of water park mechanics. You will be able to create water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and more. You will also be able to visit your friend&#x27;s parks and build together in a shared sandbox mode (though you will apparently have to build one at a time) across platforms. You can check out the announcement trailer below.


Frontier is promising its first look at gameplay on July 31, and Planet Coaster 2 will arrive later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To read Game Informer&#x27;s Planet Coaster review, follow the link.</span>

                              <span>The Double Dragon series has been around since the arcades in 1987 and has managed to maintain a surprisingly consistent release cadence in those more than 35 years. It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.
This next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It&#x27;s not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke&#x27;s, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.


For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you&#x27;re thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film&#x27;s director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film&#x27;s trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.</span>

Welcome to kick-exalting FPS Anger Foot. Violence is brutal and cartoonish. Slight mistakes kill you instantly. The soundtrack slaps. There’s an easy Devolver labelmate orientation point here, but if Hotline Miami was a cocktail of chemical euphoria and gut guilt, like realising you’ve accidentally pocketed someone’s lighter at a festival, Anger Foot is doing whippits out of balloon animals then having a great time rhythmically headbutting a portaloo for a few hours. Similarly, it’s also a bit of a masochistic ordeal to put yourself through. But, man. What a buzz.

Please watch the trailer while I yet again revisit the possibility of sneaking into Stoke-On-Trent&#x27;s Waterworld and trying to pass myself off as the resident ghost.

Founded in 2019 with the signing of Terra Invicta, and led by Dallas, Texas-based chief executive officer Tim Bender and chief financial officer Snow Rui, Hooded Horse have spent the past five years grabbing up original strategy games and strategy RPGs like a smaller civ quietly steamrolling bandit fiefdoms, while larger empires like Creative Assembly and Paradox Interactive bleed each other white in the centre.

This in itself would be borderline post-worthy, but it&#x27;s also heavily inspired by Game Boy Advance RPGs such as Golden Sun, and features music created by Golden Sun composer Motoi Sakuraba alongside Terranigma composer Masanori Hikichi.

As such, I don’t have enough experience to tell you whether the currently free Pizza Hero is an especially interesting or innovative riff on the formula. However, I am simple-minded enough to enjoy the epic bacon 1.5 humour of a sentient pizza slice with a dog for a companion upgrading itself one topping at a time. This action roguelike reeks of concentrated internet like a week old-slice nestled amidst a stack of free AOL disks. But! It’s cute and fun and free, and that’s enough for me.

Jackson Clayton honoured the proud tradition of getting the 1993 FPS to run on things where no Doom should be by porting classic opening stage E1M1, via level editor Ultimate Doom Builder, into Fortnite’s Unreal editor as a 3D model. Welcome, newcomer Fortnite, to the vaunted halls currently occupied by gut bacteria, jar-grown rat neurons, lawnmowers, teletext, electric toothbrushes, Windows notepad (sort of), and a pregnancy test.

                              <span>This week, Romano Righetti, Director of External and Public Affairs for DAZN, spoke about the challenges presented by IPTV piracy. Righetti says that at times it may appear that Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield blocking system is malfunctioning or ineffective, but that&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s all down to pirates&#x27; use of &quot;sophisticated services&quot; offered by American intermediaries.  Fortunately, the solution is straightforward; force companies like Cloudflare into compliance and prosecute users.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s dismantling of the Switch emulator scene continued this week. Using the injunction obtained against the Yuzu emulator as a base, Nintendo has just taken down projects including Suyu, Nuzu, Uzuy, Torzu and Sudachi from GitHub. Some are likely to survive elsewhere and at least one is being completely rewritten to address various issues. Whether that will pacify Nintendo is unknown.

The goal of the pirate-themed &#x27;battle royale&#x27; is to kill and plunder opponents, to become the last pirate standing. Apparently, the game itself is also subject to plundering scoundrels, as the makers have asked GitHub to take down various ad-free &#x27;copies&#x27;.

That&#x27;s something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read Game Informer’s in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here for more details – our Rook&#x27;s shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. 
And that&#x27;s when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard&#x27;s romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear. &quot;This is a mature RPG,&quot; she tells me.

                              <span>Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here&#x27;s the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft&#x27;s website.
Starting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:
    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.
    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.
    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.
Also, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.
The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.
Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.
PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.
All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.
Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?</span>

                              <span>We haven&#x27;t written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England&#x27;s capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven&#x27;t asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.
Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show&#x27;s popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon&#x27;s last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don&#x27;t get on.

He sounds positively hysterical about it, hopping mad, which you know, mate, you’ve been running the show since 2008. You’ve been working on Sonic games since 1994. I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat. The spinning ball of spines is in your court, Iizuka-san. The people of Mobius are ready. Mario has had that genre all to himself for long enough.

But recently they&#x27;ve spoken a little more about the player&#x27;s scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you&#x27;re going to have a price on your head. Makes sense.

                              <span>Many years ago game designers advised their peers to make their prototypes &quot;juicy&quot;. They were talking about the nebulous collection of sensations a player is exposed to when heads explode, coins jangle, and balls bounce. Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo&#x27;s latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character&#x27;s attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista&#x27;s coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water.

Yes, yes, it’s a metaphor, but we don’t have time for all that. Your kingdom is under attack by goblins, and the only way to get your useless underlings to chop the wood, till the fields, and train the guards needed to defend it is to provide constant surveillance. The King Is Watching is a minimalist resource-chain-em-up and wave defense goblin-knocker with a brilliant twist. I&#x27;m now a little bit obsessed with it, I think, and what is RPS if not a vehicle for chronicling my many fleeting obsessions?

                              <span>Prolific fantasy author and number one Ranni stan (“I&#x27;ll pick the ending where my character gets a waifu”) Brandon Sanderson has been thinking a lot about how to apply Elden Ring and the Souls games&#x27; signature storytelling approach to novels. During a recent playthrough on his YouTube channel, he was asked if he thinks there’s a way to replicate Souls-like descriptions in books. “I’ve wondered that. I really have,” Sanderson replies.

                              <span>Read enough of our hardware articles and you’ll eventually come across someone, probably me or Katharine (RPS in peace), banging on about the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless. After half a decade on shelves, it’s still the best low-profile mechanical gaming keyboard going, and quite possibly the best wireless keyboard to boot – while the tenkeyless version, the G915 TKL Lightspeed, is just as lovely to use.
Between their nimble performance, crisp mech switches, and impeccable build quality, the only way in which the G915 duo underwhelms is their high pricing – very much the kind you’d want to wait for a Prime Day or Black Friday to dull the pain of. Now, though, there’s an alternative: the new Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL. I’ve been using it. It’s good!

                              <span>That was…slightly cheeky of me. The Tomoe you play in parry-ful action adventure Bloodless is not the same Tomoe that was conspicuously absent from undeniable influence Sekiro. They might be based on the same historical figure, but that’s simply Sek-ulation. However! You can make your mind up yourself for zero money, since Bloodless has a free demo on Steam.

                              <span>According to the wikihow page “how to fall safely”, the best way to minimise injury while falling is to stay loose, keep your arms and legs bent, and roll on impact. According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.

Despair, ye time-constrained adults, for your carefully engineered shortage of pocket money offers no bulwark against the onslaught of games that want a slice of your evening or weekend. Today&#x27;s big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this open world survival shooter, you are a &quot;Meta-Human&quot; making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts.

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio&#x27;s existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer&#x27;s purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting &quot;don&#x27;t write us off yet!&quot; Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.

                              <span>I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of &quot;dark strategy&quot; or &quot;horror strategy&quot; games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from The Fabulous Fear Machine to The Tribe Must Survive, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.

That&#x27;s because developer Sucker Punch Production&#x27;s Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that&#x27;s almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut on May 16. 
Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut hit PC almost four years after the game&#x27;s initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation&#x27;s PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year&#x27;s Helldivers 2 or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter Concord, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like Ghost of Tsushima Directo…</span>

                              <span>Nike and Bandai Namco are teaming up to release a Tekken 8-inspired shoe that will be available for purchase this September. Dubbed &quot;Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist,&quot; these shoes will be available through Nike, SNKRS, and select retailers in-store and online for $250, as reported by Sole Retriever. 
The shoes themselves are inspired specifically by Tekken 8&#x27;s primary antagonist, Kazuya Mishima, as the colorway of the shoe is basically a spin on his outfit in-game. Sole Retriever describes the shoes as featuring an iridescent Foamposite material across the design&#x27;s upper region in armory navy, with a faux crocodile skin texture across the Foamposite material, and black hues over the leather eyestays, shoe collar, and tongue. 
Check out the Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes for yourself below: 

As you can see, the shoes also feature the Tekken logos, a Fist logo with Tekken&#x27;s signature lighting, and a nice box to hold the shoes. 
Sole Retriever reports that a second colorway in this lineup is on the way and it will reference Jin Kazama, although there&#x27;s no images of what it will look like yet. 
These Tekken 8 x Nike Air Foamposite One Fist shoes will cost you $250 when they release this September. For more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Tekken 8 review.

                              <span>Piranha Bytes, the developer of series such as Elex, Gothic, and Risen, has been shut down. The studio was owned by Embracer, which had been seeking a buyer for the German developer as part of its ongoing cost-cutting restructuring following failed $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group last year. 
It was reported that Pirahna Bytes was looking for a new publisher following job cuts last year. In January, following a period of radio silence and inactivity from the studio, CEO Micahel Rüve addressed reports of an impending closure by stating the company was in a “difficult situation” while expressing optimism about finding a partner by saying, “Don’t write us off yet!” 
However, German website GameStar (as surfaced by Eurogamer) published a story reporting the studio was…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a BioWare RPG, which means a lot of things, including the fact that the game will feature romance. Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare&#x27;s Edmonton office for the current Game Informer cover story, Veilguard will be the team&#x27;s most romantic game yet. 
Relationship Level
Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don&#x27;t help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion&#x27;s Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion. Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook&#x27;s expansive tree, which features passive a…</span>

                              <span>Developer-publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has revealed Disney Pixel RPG, an upcoming 8-bit adventure starring Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Genie from Aladdin, Baymax from Big Hero 6, and many more beloved characters. It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date. 
According to the game&#x27;s website, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game&#x27;s September 9 launch – there&#x27;s no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however. 
&quot;The game world that these Disney characters call home have suddenly been invaded by strange programs, and are starting to break down,&quot; the story description reads on the game&#x27;s website. &quot;These previously isolated game worlds have merged, throwing all the characters into confusion. Take on the role of a player of these games and join Disney characters as you embark on an epic quest across multiple game worlds to restore order.&quot; 
The game&#x27;s listing on Apple&#x27;s App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions. 
Here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s combat: 
And here&#x27;s a look at the game&#x27;s avatar customization: 
Disney Pixel RPG launches in Japan on iOS and Android on September 9, 2024. There&#x27;s no word on when to expect it in other regions of the world.

                              <span>The Ukrainian city of Mariupol came under heavy bombardment during the opening months of Russia&#x27;s invasion in 2022, a programme of artillery and air strikes that damaged or destroyed the majority of residential buildings and has killed or dispossessed thousands of people. It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.
The Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game&#x27;s isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.

MMO happen. EVE Vanguard - the studio&#x27;s admirable fourth crack at it - was announced last September. Since then, it&#x27;s been in gated pre-alpha, offering weekend playtests to EVE Online Omega subscribers. According to a new and rather vague roadmap, should get a substantial update this November.

I&#x27;ve been playing the demo for &quot;cute-creepy&quot; RPG and life sim Mushroom Musume, in which you - an unnamed &quot;Recluse&quot; - cultivate and play as a series of mushroom daughters. My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She&#x27;s a Common Turquoise Truffle. She&#x27;s got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn&#x27;t tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC.

Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and raised more than $2.5 million for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of Outer Wilds but without using the game&#x27;s spaceship (what).

Here time travel means dodging bullets, reversing flubbed hacking, and replaying that conversation you had with the bouncer that got you booted to the curb. “A bloody good time-troubling tactical shooter,” decreed Adam Smith (RPS in Peace) in his review.

Russian citizens Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were facing extradition to the United States after a judge approved their transfer. After filing an appeal at the Supreme Court of Justice requesting political refugee status, the pair apparently vanished into thin air.

Anna&#x27;s Archive remains silent but did switch to a new domain name recently, which may not be entirely coincidental.

                              <span>Anti-piracy company Web Sheriff was once known for its off-the-wall approach to tackling infringement. Presumably part of its strategy to get noticed in the market, the company has since matured as an all-round brand protection service. Still, a pair of copyright claims sent to Cloudflare recently are so ridiculously over the top, it&#x27;s hard to take them seriously. Unexpectedly, Cloudflare responded by blocking URLs on two pirate sites leading to the rarely-seen &#x27;451&#x27; error.

Stick to games!” is a common refrain you might hear from the sort of winning individual who thinks books are a communist plot to lower their sperm count. Luckily, those people are elsewhere, so I hope you’ll allow me a brief moment of relief that the Tories are no longer in power. This is a great thing, providing you have absolutely no follow-up questions! This week, it’s QWOP, Getting Over It, and Ape Out&#x27;s Bennet Foddy! Cheers Bennet! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

These institutions take their obligations very seriously, as warnings for long defunct software such as LimeWire and Kazaa are still prevalent.  Also making an appearance in 2024 are BearShare, Blubster, eDonkey, Gnucleus, Shareaza and others.

Two days after returning home from my vacation in Japan, Tokyo-based developer Nagai Industries Inc. released a trailer for its upcoming adventure game, InKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and I was immediately taken back to my convenience store (“konbini” is Japanese for convenience stores, generally) adventures days prior. From Lawson’s excellent spicy chicken to 7-Eleven’s life-altering egg salad sandos, convenience stores in Japan are incredible, as strange as that is to write. InKonbini is a ’90s love letter to the konbinis of Japan, and after speaking with Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen about InKonbini, I couldn’t be more sold.

                              <span>Few types of media hook me like a good documentary. The genre uses the best elements of traditional filmmaking to amplify what will always be the greatest story ever told: reality. Whether it’s an educational look at the natural world, a gripping true crime tale, or an enlightening biography of a noteworthy figure, the best documentaries manage to educate as effectively as they entertain.
The video games industry is now old enough to have been subjected to its fair share of documentaries, from The King of Kong to Indie Game: The Movie to Netflix’s High Score. But no matter how good they are, they all generate a tough-to-pin-down anxiety in me I never consciously noticed until recently: By the time the film ends, or, more often, in the middle of it, I just want to stop watching and play the…</span>

Who thought hip-hop would take it this far?
As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of hip-hop last year, it’s now a good time to look back at how ingrained hip-hop music is in gaming, from NBA2K (remember that 2K13 soundtrack curated by Jay-Z?), Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed, to Cyberpunk 2077 and, of course, Fortnite.
Mortal Kombat 11 came out of the gates in 2018 with a fiery trailer featuring music by 21 Savage, and later Megan Thee Stallion live-streamed an MK11 match on Twitch. The lore of Grand Theft Auto continues to grow, powered by recent GTA Online upda…</span>

If the Court of Justice&#x27;s judgment ultimately favors Sony, the implications are likely to reach far beyond a device designed to interact with a game console discontinued a decade ago. For the greater good, it&#x27;s a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.

Space Age will arrive this October alongside a major 2.0 update for the moreish factory-automating hit, with the expansion costing as much as the base game. It sounds like there’ll be plenty to show for that price, mind.

Though to what degree you could consider it alive and well - reanimated in a twisted form of its previous glory, perhaps - is another question entirely.

                              <span>Dawntrail, the latest expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, has officially been out just three days, arriving earlier this week after a brief early access release. Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.

                              <span>It&#x27;s Sokoban! A game whose name I recognise as shorthand for this type of puzzle, and yet have never seen. It&#x27;s also a genre I&#x27;m not overly fond of, preferring puzzles I can sometimes get through by intuition (Spring Falls), brute force (every switch-the-lights puzzle ever), or entering chaos mode (real life).
But I like Isles of Sea and Sky. From starting it almost on a whim, I was playing and figuring things out with zero fuss and no overt tutorialising pretty much immediately, and from there suddenly found that several hours had breezed by without frustration or boredom.

This is on-brand. But, oh no, a wink to real life gambling could be interpreted as a transparent acknowledgement of the gacha genre&#x27;s psychological claw machine, which is maybe why the developers decided the scratchcard stall should have a sole employee: a very cute dog.

                              <span>We never covered the original Nocturnal, an “intense 3-hour-long action-platformer” from Sunnyside Games, but the Steam user reception seems very positive for a pay-upfront game that actively describes itself as three hours long, and the just-announced sequel seems excellently awash with fire, darkness and death. It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.

                              <span>The space industrialism of Satisfactory is distinct from other efficiency sims about making endless conveyor belts in two important ways. One: it&#x27;s a mash-up with the first-person survival genre that sees you stranded on an alien planet, a la Subnautica. Two: there is a dedicated coffee cup item from which you can leisurely sip. It&#x27;s been in early access since 2019 and, hey, it&#x27;s rather good. We knew developers Coffee Stain were planning a 1.0 release this year. But more concrete details from management have finally trickled down to the little guy. Version 1.0 will hit stores on September 10th, they say. The complete version will include flushable toilets, a &quot;much sought after addition to the game&quot;, we&#x27;re told.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this applies in other countries, but in England we have this thing where you&#x27;ll stroll down some random suburban street without a care in the world, and stumble on a house that has been absolutely overrun by garden gnomes. A house on which garden gnomes have either settled, like the avian hoodlums in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, or from which they have erupted, like the malignant mushrooms of Annihilation.
A hundred clay and plaster eyes catch yours, unblinking; a hundred figures seemingly freeze in the act of pushing a toy wheelbarrow or smoking a pipe. The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here. There is only bare, cracked earth. And the gnomes.

She&#x27;s seen a certain health-regen bug fixed, so everyone&#x27;s not being duped into thinking she&#x27;s been heavily nerfed since the Shadow Lands sprung forth.

                              <span>Dragon Age features a ton of different customization options. Just within the character creator, there are hundreds of options to customize things like hair, body type, what your playable character Rook&#x27;s face looks like, and so much more. There are also a ton of armor options, too. 
Companions have an armor slot, a ring slot, an accessory slot, and a weapon slot, while Rook has access to even more – a helmet, two weapon slots, a belt, an amulet slot, and two ring slots. A belt having its own slot might sound odd as it&#x27;s not an armor piece people typically think of when kitting out an RPG warrior. However, the belt is an important facet of Rook&#x27;s kit. The better Rook&#x27;s belt, the better the potency of their healing potions, which are replenished by destroying green pots scattered about the …</span>

We&#x27;re also joined by our wonderful podcast editor Matt Storm to give their thoughts on Alan Wake 2&#x27;s Night Springs DLC, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and their first foray into Sam Barlow&#x27;s Immortality. Marcus Stewart spills the tea on his time playing the closed beta for the bubbly open-world dress up game Infinity Nikki and his first excursion through the typing-based dungeon crawler Cryptmaster. We round the show with Kyle Hillard and Marcus giving their obligatory Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree check-ins.

                              <span>Deflecting a crossbow’s bolt in real life takes practice. In the Resident Evil 4 (RE4) VR port, all it takes is lifting the controller in the air at the right time.
And it’s always satisfying.
The parry mechanic is one of the novel additions of the 2023 remake developed by Capcom. Whenever a bolt or melee attack from an infected villager is about to impact Leon Kennedy, you only need to press a button to deflect with the in-game knife. This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.
Adapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy. Instead of Leon doing a swift animation with just a button press, you need to grab the knife from your chest, lift it up in the air, and match the incoming attack. I…</span>

The first Monaco released in 2013 at a point when Xbox Live Arcade had hit its stride, and there was a new appetite for the type of creative and unique game that existed below the huge budget triple-A, high-fidelity experience. Those kinds of games vastly outnumber the big-budget experiences we are familiar with today, but in 2013 we were discovering such experiences and marveling at their ingenuity. The competition is stiffer for Monaco 2 as it nears release, but creator Andy Schatz is clearly excited to revisit the criminal gameplay saying, “If Monaco 1 is about cat and mouse, Monaco 2 is about complexity and creativity.”
Like the original, Monaco 2 is a game about pulling of…</span>

                              <span>The culture around social interaction is constantly shifting, but those profoundly strange years of the pandemic were especially jarring. In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.
For some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever. If home is your first place, and work is your second, the third place is the other social and gathering hub for your life as part of a c…</span>

But wait! What about as a strategy game? Denis glances nervously at the inexplicable open pools of molten steel all around us. I&#x27;ve got him now. He hasn&#x27;t even played Spice Wars. Except...

But until now we haven&#x27;t addressed the genre in its own right. In an act of contrition, we offer you this: our list of the best JRPGs you can play on PC this year, according to our own tastes.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no genre like the open world for inducing choice paralysis, so it&#x27;s fitting that I&#x27;ve been agonising over how to begin this irregular article series on open world games for months. I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it&#x27;s best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring?

Indie game store Itch.io has begun its own summer sale, and for those willing to delve into its rainbow-coloured heap of throwaway toys and fun experiments, plenty of deals await.

                              <span>Wuthering Waves, that recent gacha RPG of anime styling and impenetrable jargonblasting, just didn’t work on the Steam Deck when it launched in May. It also doesn’t work right now. But for one brief, debatably glorious day on June 29th, it did. And thus, Deck owners who’d persevered through a slightly fiddly installation process (explained here by YouTubesmith Deck Wizard) could finally take their first joyous steps into Wuthering Waves like a David Hasselhoff-buoyed East German in 1989.
Unlike the Hoff, it wouldn’t last. Within hours, Steam Deck players were being booted back out of the game by a hitherto-unseen anti-cheat failure. What gives? Or gave?

                              <span>The tabletop equivalent of “buying books and reading them are two different hobbies” is surely the difference between buying sexy tabletop RPG manuals and actually dragging your mates on to Discord for a few hours to stumble your way through a module. It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published CrossOver: Roll For Initiative. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.

                              <span>EA has announced that it will delist three Battlefield titles from the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 digital storefronts at the end of the month. 
On July 31, the PS3/Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline, along with their associated DLCs, will be removed from sale. Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process.

June 28, 2024
While the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.
It never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn&#x27;t be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn&#x27;t work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you&#x27;ve got a few more months to enjoy the ride.

                              <span>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Tales of Kenzera: Zau, has announced it is laying off just over a dozen employees. This follows the release of its first game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, back in April, which launched to good reviews. 
Surgent doesn&#x27;t explain why; it says it&#x27;s focusing on supporting those affected, continuing work on Tales of Kenzera: Zau, and looking ahead to future projects. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s statement, in full: 
Studio head and founder Abubakar Salim, who also voiced the titular Zau in the team&#x27;s first game, released his own statement addressing the layoffs: 
Surgent Studios grows an unfortunately ever-growing list of studios affected by layoffs in 2024. 
Last month, Paradox Interactive closed its Paradox Tectonic Studio the same week it canceled its first game, Life…</span>

One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That&#x27;s not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it&#x27;s nice to hear.  &quot;It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7,&quot; he said, &quot;but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial.&quot;

                              <span>The Fear &amp; Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.

Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.

The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!

                              <span>Developer Stormind Games and publisher Saber Interactive have released a new story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcasing more of this upcoming first-person horror game&#x27;s silent alien-infested world. And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. 
Though there&#x27;s still no release date – it&#x27;s launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. 
Check it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: 


As you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you&#x27;ve seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Hasbro and developer Outright Games have revealed Transformers: Galactic Trials, an arcade robot racing game with roguelite combat. It launches on October 11 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. 
The reveal trailer features a look at the hybrid racing game, which allows players to select Autobots and Decepticons, use them in combat encounters in Bot Mode, and race as them in each Transformer&#x27;s Alt Mode. You can play solo or against a friend.
Check it out for yourself in the Transformers: Galactic Trials trailer below: 


&quot;Evil Nemesis Prime has stolen the Prime Relics, which bestow incredible powers on whoever possesses them,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Now, the Autobots and Decepticons are in an explosive race to recover the relics – the future of Cybertron is in your hands. 
&quot;Choose your character from icons like Bumblebee, Megatron, and Optimus Prime. Speed into action on battle-race circuits, drift and boost to charge up Energon, then unleash devastating special moves in battle. And use your experience to unlock new skills, characters, and skins. It&#x27;s the ultimate test of your favorite Transformers&#x27; abilities, which will decide the future of Cybertron.&quot;

                              <span>Capcom Next was a more succint affair this summer. It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here&#x27;s a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title. 


Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become availabl…</span>

I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included. But unlike me, doom scrolling on X (former…</span>

That&#x27;s extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It&#x27;s easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I&#x27;ve ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here.

The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that&#x27;s being written to some folder deep in your PC&#x27;s innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.
But is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m a gamer, not an ideas man.

                              <span>Big large huge RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt recently got a fresh set of official modding tools in the form of REDKit, a powerful bit of downloadable that helps you add whatever you fancy to the game, including entire custom questlines. Not two months on from REDKit’s release, ‘Tuber xLetalis and modder glassfish - a contributor to the cut-content-restoring Brothers in Arms mod - have put together a showcase containing around 20 minutes of cut content from the game’s ending. Cheers, cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer!

                              <span>The developers of speedy first-person shooter Selaco have dropped a big patch for the retro blaster, adding new weapon upgrades and mutators that can change the game&#x27;s difficulty in piecemeal ways, like making enemies stronger for an added challenge. There&#x27;s a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. &quot;We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons,&quot; the developers say. But wait, isn&#x27;t there a slide kick in the game already?

A delicious ‘fruit and nut’ bar, if you will.

                              <span>You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it&#x27;s not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it&#x27;s a &quot;boss rush&quot; with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I&#x27;d like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke &#x3D; is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it&#x27;s a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There&#x27;s a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.

Spoilsport. This week, it’s the creative director of Dread Delusion, maker of The Night is Darkening, and Lovely Hellplace director, James Wragg! Cheers James! Mind if we have a nose at your bookshelf?

Sitting at my desk next to the window, my eye keeps being caught by the hypnotic swaying of the treetops. It&#x27;s quite magical, really. I might go for a walk later.
Just kidding. I&#x27;m superglued to my desk chair (thankfully it&#x27;s a very comfy chair), and I&#x27;m ready for a weekend that&#x27;s distinguishable from the weekdays only in name. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

                              <span>Dune Imperium is a fabulous strategy game about becoming the biggest spice boy on a sandy planet I presume is called Dune. I love it despite never having read the Dune books or watched the Dune movies, because the digital version taught me everything I needed to know about Barry Harkonnen, Oscar Isaac, the tall guy from Guardians Of The Galaxy, and their insatiable pursuit of space nutmeg.

Now the board game&#x27;s first expansion is headed to the digital version of the game, and it&#x27;s called Rise Of Ix for reasons I definitely understand.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.
The upcoming &quot;Souls-lite&quot; fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.
We last saw Flintlock during the Xbox Games Showcase a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: &quot;Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

Infinity Nikki’s big PlayStation State of Play spotlight in May garnered an array of reactions. Fans of the popular Nikki series of mobile fashion games were excited to see the pink-haired fashionista make her triple-A debut.

                              <span>Developer Don&#x27;t Nod Entertainment has delayed its upcoming two-part narrative-driven adventure game, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, to early 2025. As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. 
Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don&#x27;t Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017&#x27;s Before the Storm and 2021&#x27;s True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. 
We&#x27;ve made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage to early 2025. We know you&#x27;re all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine.

Life Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. 
In the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer. After that, check out this extended Double Exposure gameplay trailer to learn how the game will acknowledge the first Life Is Strange&#x27;s endings.

                              <span>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it&#x27;s 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that&#x27;d be more at home in a horror game. 
But I&#x27;m also looking forward to the community&#x27;s reaction to the Dragon Age series&#x27; best character creator yet. At the heart …</span>

                              <span>We got our first big look at Concord, PlayStation&#x27;s upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter, during a State of Play last month. And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer&#x27;s full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we&#x27;re excited to play more. 
We have a lot of questions remaining about the game&#x27;s progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we&#x27;ve played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation&#x27;s HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game&#x27;s 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes.

Last month, PlayStation released the first big look at Concord, its upcoming 5v5 multiplayer hero shooter from Firewalk Studios, a team it acquired last year. Though the recent cinematic footage teases something like a single-player, narrative-driven heist game akin to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, the gameplay reveal that followed showcased the strictly multiplayer experience in a new light. Admittedly, this reveal left me feeling blasé; it looked fine, but not necessarily something I hadn&#x27;t seen before. However, after playing the game for a few hours during a recent previ…</span>

                              <span>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed. Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.
Developer 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:
“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. 
“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.
11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. 
Frostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.</span>

                              <span>Developer Aspyr Media and publisher Lucasfilm Games have revealed that an enhanced edition of 2002&#x27;s Star Wars: Bounty Hunter will launch on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this August. More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game&#x27;s most infamous easter egg. 
In the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. 
Check out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: 


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. 
In the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, &quot;Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.&quot; However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game&#x27;s campaign. 
Star Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. 
While waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year. Read Game Informer&#x27;s Star Wars Outlaws cover story after that.

                              <span>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there&#x27;s no word on when to expect the remaster either. 
Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It&#x27;s unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we&#x27;re stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.

Outside of remasters and remakes, the Super Monkey Ball franchise has been dormant for a decade. At a certain point, it began feeling like AiAi and his crew of monkeys were relics of a bygone era and that Super Monkey Ball was little more than a nostalgic series that has no real place in the modern gaming landscape. Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble disputes that assertion by delivering an experience that’s at once delightful, maddening, and rewarding, but above all else, fun.
At its best, Banana Rumble’s Adventure Mode delivers some of the top stages in Super Monk…</span>

                              <span>Publisher Playtonic Friends (the publishing arm of Yooka-Laylee developer Playtonic) and Blossom Tales developer Castle Pixel have revealed Cattle Country, a simulation game that&#x27;s Stardew Valley meets the Wild West. If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. 
The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there&#x27;s no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country&#x27;s Steam listing simply says the release date is &quot;to be announced.&quot; 
Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2&#x27;s Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan&#x27;s voice actor, Roger Clark. 
&quot;Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam listing reads. &quot;Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you&#x27;d expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.&quot;
Here are some Cattle Country screenshots: 

While waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer&#x27;s Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe&#x27;s next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier.

                              <span>The one and only Elden Ring expansion we&#x27;re getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. 
Now live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s changed: 
The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. 
The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. 


This patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn&#x27;t – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads &quot;1.12.2&quot; if it has – select &quot;LOGIN&quot; and that will apply the latest version of the game. 
The only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you&#x27;ve previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you&#x27;re encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game&#x27;s system graphical settings. 
This patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree&#x27;s launch. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software&#x27;s Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games.

After customizing much of your Rook&#x27;s body, including things like a Qunari&#x27;s horn type and material, for example, with the hundreds of options available in Veilguard, it will be time to pick said class.

There’s something quite special about Still Wakes the Deep. A horror game, quintessentially Scottish through and through, with an atmosphere so tense you could hear your heart pounding as you explore areas, has the right ingredients to make for a memorable experience.
