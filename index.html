As part of Sonic&#x27;s 31st anniversary this week, Sega held Sonic Station livestream celebrating the launch of Sonic Origins.
During the broadcast, Sega also announced a year-long collaboration with the Hololive Virtual YouTuber (and Sonic fan) Inugami Korone - titled “Sonikoro 2022&quot;. She&#x27;s now got her own special Sonic-themed outfit, and in addition to this, it&#x27;s been revealed she&#x27;ll also be providing voice over work for the Japanese dub of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie.

Next week sees the long-awaited release of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This is new DLC for Monster Hunter Rise adding new monsters and much more to the existing game.
Ahead of the launch, Capcom shared some news about the game&#x27;s demos. As of 30th June (the same date as the DLC release), the original Monster Hunter Rise game demo will no longer be available on Nintendo Switch or Steam.

While Resident Evil and Street Fighter are firmly in the spotlight right now, I&#x27;ve also been curious about Exoprimal, Capcom&#x27;s five-on-five team action game in which players go to town on hordes of no-good dinosaurs. The idea is to be better (read: faster) at completing objectives than the opposing squad, in order to appease a conniving AI named Leviathan.
It&#x27;s not going to be to everyone&#x27;s tastes — and I sympathize with any ride-or-die fan who is exclusively holding out for a Dino Crisis revival (maybe one day...) — but as someone who got into Lost Planet back in the day, I&#x27;m intrigued. Exoprimal seems like the kind of project we haven&#x27;t really gotten out of Capcom in recent years, for better or worse.

Though AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative is a mouthful of a name, visual novel fans are likely familiar with the writer behind it. Kotaro Uchikoshi is back for this follow-up to 2019&#x27;s AI: The Somnium Files with a new case, new investigators, and a story so good that it, at times, eclipses its predecessor.
Getting a mystery story right is tough. A good detective thriller has to carefully thread a needle, leading the player along without tugging too hard or leaving too much slack. Nirvana Initiative does so quite well, composing the kind of bending, twisting story you&#x27;d expect from the writer behind Ever17 and the Zero Escape series.
The story gets both comedy and drama just right, while also presenting some very well-crafted puzzles and pseudo-escape rooms. A…</span>

Even with Haunted Chocolatier on the horizon, the creator of Stardew Valley can&#x27;t seem to step away from the farm-sim life for good, and we love him for it. Update 1.5 was a banger. With a whole new island to explore and expand, plus plenty of small but impactful quality-of-life enhancements, it could&#x27;ve gone down as the game&#x27;s &quot;final update&quot; — it felt like it. But what are the odds of Stardew Valley 1.6? ConcernedApe says it&#x27;s coming.
Responding to a fan on Twitter, the developer said that Stardew Valley will get a 1.6 update — though we should keep our expectations in check. It&#x27;ll be focused on making modders&#x27; lives &quot;easier,&quot; and while there will be &quot;some new content,&quot; it won&#x27;t be &quot;huge.&quot;

                              <span>Chris Pratt as Mario is still leaving me skeptical
When we all saw that Chris Pratt had been cast as the plumber in red in the upcoming animated Mario movie, a few eyebrows were raised, to say the least. He&#x27;s a fine actor, but I don&#x27;t know that I trust him to do one of the most iconic video game characters justice, especially after the legacy that Charles Martinet has created.
One of the most glaring questions to come up surrounding Pratt&#x27;s involvement in the movie over the past few weeks is whether or not he&#x27;ll have an Italian accent, which is arguably one of Mario&#x27;s most recognizable features.
In an exclusive interview with Variety, Pratt gave a little bit of insight into what fans can expect from his work on the movie.

&quot;I worked really closely with the directors and trying out a few things and landed on something that I’m really proud of and can’t wait for people to see and hear,&quot; Pratt said. &quot;I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.&quot;
This could mean a lot of things, but I hope it means that they at least did something. The thought of Chris Pratt&#x27;s unaltered voice coming out of Mario sends chills down my spine.
When Variety brought up fans&#x27; apprehension in a separate interview about Pratt&#x27;s casting as a character of Italian heritage, Illumination Entertainment&#x27;s founder and CEO Chris Meledandri said that because he is Italian American himself, he feels that he can &quot;make that decision without worrying about offending Italians or Italian Americans. … I think we’re gonna be just fine. Especially because (Pratt has) given such a strong performance.&quot;
Meledandri also said that &quot;when people hear Chris Pratt’s performance, the criticism will evaporate.&quot; I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see about that one.

                              <span>The protagonist is not named Max
I fell hopelessly in love with Metal Max Xeno Reborn. It was my first time with the series, which has been running in Japan since 1991. It was quite the roller coaster for me. I immediately jumped online and placed an order for some of the series’ early games. I felt the heartbreak of Metal Max: Wild West getting canceled. Then I found love again in Metal Max for the Famicom. Then I reminded myself that Metal Max: Wild West was canceled, and now I’m sad again.
Metal Max has largely stayed in Japan, outside of Xeno and its Reborn cousin. We got Metal Saga on PS2, but that went by without much notice. Maybe we’ll get a re-release on PS5 now that Sony is doing that again. There were many titles that flitted by without our anglophone notice, and I plan on delvi…</span>

                              <span>Sekiro has had a second wind lately and I&#x27;m loving it
Look, this was an easy sell for me. I&#x27;m a simple man: I see Sekiro news in 2022, even by way of fan-created content, and I get excited. That includes this Elden Ring Sekiro mod (with a bit of Bloodborne), which addresses one crucial mechanical aspect: rolling/dodging.
Created by nmsl2018, the mod&#x27;s concept is very easy to grasp, but it has a whopper of a name: &quot;replace light roll animation with Sekiro step and medium roll with Bloodborne step.&quot; The title says it all! It literally removes the light roll from the game and replaces it with the Sekiro quickstep, and the medium roll (which most players are likely working with) is now a Bloodborne sidestep. In other words, combat is going to flow a lot differently with a different dodge animation/mechanic.
So Bloodborne always gets a ton of praise, but you gotta love seeing anything mention Sekiro in 2022. Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve heard of a lot of people getting either back into Sekiro or playing it for the first time after folks have finished Elden Ring, which is fantastic. It never really got the same amount of coverage or any significant post-launch content, but it&#x27;ll go down in history as an action classic.
Consider this an extra positive review, on top of our review! While it might not be the ideal candidate for a &quot;first From Software game,&quot; it forges its own path and differentiates itself from the rest of the pack in a big way.

Various Final Fantasy VII Remake changes have been big hits or have created their own micro-controversies, but today the team sat down via an official Square Enix blog to talk about more specifics.
So there&#x27;s a lot to unpack here. We&#x27;ll start with Midgar. Suffice to say, there will be spoilers below for the story of Final Fantasy VII and the Remake.
Teruki Endo, battle director on the Remake, opened up by noting that two of the most-used bits of materia on the team are Magnify and Elemental — and I can definitely relate to heavy use of the latter. ATB assist is also a big one. Interestingly, Endo notes that they didn&#x27;t notice a ton of variation between materia usage, which they describe as a &quot;challenge&quot; to address in the sequel. Nice…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not a multi-day game, just a click
There&#x27;s a Genshin Impact free Primogems promotion going on now, and it involves the release of the new Chasm OST.
As a reminder, the Chasm is a recent area added to the game in a past update, and now the soundtrack for it is ready to be unleashed out into the world. It&#x27;s also tied to a semi-convoluted promotion. You have to be logged in, listen to three of the five preview tracks in the web app from the OST, and share it. Then you&#x27;ll be entered into a drawing to get 40 Primogems and an avatar frame. The weird catch is that two million people will be selected, so your odds are high in terms of being a winner.
You can enter the Genshin Impact drawing from now through June 30 at 23:59 UTC+8, at which point winners will be selected within a week of the end of the event. Just go to the page here and &quot;share&quot; the OST. The easiest methods are just clicking the link or &quot;save image&quot; icons. They&#x27;re highlighted in red below!
Note that you need to listen to the tracks while logged in, then slick a share button. Once you&#x27;re all good to go a pop-up will appear and confirm it: do that if you want to be sure!

                              <span>With plenty more projects on the way
In a new interview with 4Gamer (translated by Gematsu), FromSoftware president and game director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the studio&#x27;s next game has entered the &quot;final stages&quot; of development, and he&#x27;s &quot;already working on [his] next title as a director.&quot;
With respect to the almost-finished game, our best guess is a new Armored Core. In January, details about an unannounced Armored Core game reportedly leaked out of a consumer survey, including images that were all scuffed up but looked legit.
It&#x27;s been a looong wait for Armored Core fans, and expectations are high.
What&#x27;s next for Miyazaki
Miyazaki also gave a juicy quote about his vision for the future: &quot;In the mid-to-long term, I would like to work on a more abstract fantasy than anything we&#x27;ve done…</span>

                              <span>A new presentation just showcased some Xbox cloud gaming enhancements
Xbox cloud gaming mouse and keyboard support, continually teased for roughly a year now, is finally coming to the platform. Announced by way of the Microsoft Game Dev YouTube channel in a stream meant to assist developers creating projects on the Xbox platform, the long-awaited feature is going to be rolled out widely this year.
Xbox engineer Morgan Brown started the segment (which begins at 16:45 in the below video) on how they&#x27;ve been looking at adding the feature &quot;for a while now,&quot; and are finally implementing it. As Brown puts it, developers can add the feature &quot;right now,&quot; as a way to plus up the game for folks who aren&#x27;t using cloud gaming on PC already.
Brown also touched on a few other topics that will make Xbox cloud gaming that much smoother in the future:
Tricks to achieve lower latency for cloud gaming, which results in snappier controls
The introduction of direct capture for cloud gaming
Tips to create a better UI for mobile devices that avoid the &quot;tiny text problem&quot;
Full screen rendering system changes that allow for more custom resolutions, so cloud gaming looks better overall (with less black bars, and even resizing on the fly)
Easier access to adding subtitles for accessibility, as well as brightness, audio, and controller remapping options (with options to save individual device settings, so you don&#x27;t need to constantly remap or readjust)
All good stuff! So far Microsoft has been one of the better purveyors of cloud gaming, so hopefully the above bullet point enhancements continue to flow like wine.

                              <span>The executive is forgoing about a third of his annual compensation
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot is taking a pay cut of about a third of his annual compensation for the coming year. The slash underscores how Ubisoft seems to be going through some hard times.
According to an Ubisoft filing reported on by Axios, Guillemot will forgo about €310,607 (or roughly $327,000) he would have received over the next year.
This particular amount was linked to both Ubisoft&#x27;s financial performance and the execution of its reforms, meant to address the company&#x27;s misconduct scandals that arose in 2020.
&quot;This is a personal decision by Yves Guillemot, which he took considering that the company had not reached the financial targets that it had publicly communicated to the markets,&quot; an Ubisoft representative told Axios.

Sailing through rough waters
Ubisoft has been in some hot water for a while. Last year, employee turnover was reportedly unusually high. And an open petition last November called for leadership to meet workers&#x27; demands for fundamental change at the company.
Even on the game release front, Ubisoft has been having some trouble. Ghost Recon Breakpoint feels like it was the start of it, failing to meet expectations for the shooter series. The Prince of Persia remake was quietly moved to a new release window. And Roller Champions finally went live to surprisingly little fanfare.
This pay cut underscores the tough times Ubisoft is navigating at the moment. The company has a few games on the docket, like Avatar and Skull &amp; Bones, though its launch calendar for those isn&#x27;t clear yet.

                              <span>Wards are being revised to favor private housing
In yet another move to satiate folks who want to buy an in-game house, the Final Fantasy XIV player housing system is changing a bit. But not nearly enough as some may have hoped.
As a recap, player housing continues to be a problem. The recent lottery system for the new zone didn&#x27;t really go as planned, and big free companies [guilds] snatch up a lot of land, frustrating players who want a private home. The team, largely, hasn&#x27;t really done anything to alleviate these issues. And the upcoming fix (slated for July) isn&#x27;t going to do much either.
Breaking it down, Square Enix has announced that starting July 10, at 8AM PT, Final Fantasy XIV player housing ward ownership will be revised. So in the past, free company housing was allowed for wards one through 18: now it&#x27;s wards one through nine. Previously, private housing was focused on wards 19 through 24, now it&#x27;s 10 through 24.
In theory, it&#x27;s a big boost. But the heart of the matter is that free companies have already taken a ton of housing. On some servers, this might amount to one or two total houses for the entire populace, as-is. Now as free companies break up/quit the game and more houses become available, it could help in the future. But for now, players can&#x27;t help but feel like the player housing responses so far have been underwhelming.

                              <span>Spartan Points could let players directly buy cosmetics
343 Industries is looking into a new way to pick up cosmetics in its Halo collection. The studio says it&#x27;s considering adding microtransactions to Halo: The Master Chief Collection through purchasable Spartan Points.
Prior to now, Seasons in Halo: The Master Chief Collection offered Season Points, which were earned through challenges and leveling up. But Seasons are being fazed out of the MCC. 343 Industries confirms in its blog post that these will be renamed to Spartan Points in the future.
Alongside the change, 343 is looking at new ways to unlock cosmetics. This would be through purchasing Spartan Points.
&quot;It is prudent to note here that we are happy with the current system of how players earn Spartan Points, by completing challenges and levelling up through play. This would be an optional, additive alternative for players who might find the vast scope of content to be an intimidating amount of playtime and want to get ahead on (or skip) the grind, or maybe want to grab specific items they want (we all have our favorites!)&quot;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4qBkw4YwGrM
The Master Chief&#x27;s Collection
It&#x27;s important to note this is being internally explored, for the time being. 343 says it&#x27;s sharing the idea ahead of time in the interest of &quot;transparency&quot; with the community.
It&#x27;s also stressing that Spartan Points would be additive. And it&#x27;s worth noting the sheer amount of cosmetics in Halo: The Master Chief Collection: well over 1000, by 343&#x27;s count.
As long as playtime-earning these cosmetics still exists, there are two avenues for Halo cosmetics. Purchasable points seem like they would potentially be a fast-track, buy-it-now option.
More updates on Halo: The Master Chief Collection and its Spartan Points are coming in the future.

                              <span>Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64 were changed behind the scenes too
Nintendo has made some minor N64 system changes to coincide with the release of Pokemon Snap (the original) on the Switch Online service. Interestingly enough, they&#x27;re making it tougher to datamine the exact changes with each subsequent Expansion Pack patch.
The obfuscation of the configuration files was discovered by dataminer OatmealDome, who pointed out the new alteration on Twitter. What they were able to sleuth out though is extra language options for the EU version, as well as the addition of CPU hacks for Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64. F-Zero X and Mario Golf&#x27;s files were changed too, potentially in a bid to address the former&#x27;s framerate problems users have been pointing out since it arrived.
At the very least, this changelog (while clouded in mist) shows that Nintendo is still updating the Nintendo 64 lineup, following the incredibly rocky launch. Some didn&#x27;t hold out hope that they&#x27;d revisit them, but since then, they&#x27;ve tackled some of the bigger, rougher needs, including a game-breaking bug for Kirby 64.
That&#x27;s the good news in terms of the Nintendo 64 project. The bad news is that the cadence is still super slow. There are tons of games to get to, even in terms of just first-party releases, and in 2022, the drip-feed release model doesn&#x27;t quite hit the same.

The Mothman Equinox activity is coming back to Fallout 76, after a roughly six-month hiatus from the game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4vKlPsSFsLs
Originally debuting as part of the &quot;Night of the Moth&quot; major update last December, the studio also noted that the Mothman Equinox activity specifically would return on a semi-regular basis. It kicks off at 12:00PM ET on June 28, and will run through July 12 at 12:00PM ET. There don&#x27;t seem to be any major changes: you just need to talk to Interpreter Clarence on top of the Mothman Museum, and they&#x27;ll give you the quests needed to start joining in on the activities/events for Mothman Equinox.
In other big news, Test your Metal just arrived recently, and we have a new launch trailer that quickly showcases what you can expect, as well as a more detailed developer breakdown. It&#x27;ll get players through roughly another three months of gametime, as all eyes are on the September Pitt update after that.
Of course, all of these patches are cumulative. They&#x27;re adding new content and quality of life features/fixes to Fallout 76, and have done a fantastic job of shoring up the game since launch. Even things like the radio plays are fun to listen to outside of the game, if you still feel burned by the original release.

Edia, the indie outfit behind the recent Valis: The Fantasm Collection is getting back on board the retro train this week, opening a brand new crowdfunding campaign to secure the budget for a brand new remaster/rerelease of forgotten Nippon Telenet franchise Cosmic Fantasy.
Originally released on PC Engine way back in 1990, Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu is a dungeon-crawling RPG that focuses on our young protagonist who is forced from a pleasant life of farming to become the leader of an intergalactic space force. As you do. Accompanied by his feline pal Nyan and the beautiful Saya, Yuu embarked upon multiple adventures, with the franchise going on to spawn toys, manga, and anime series. It is renowned for its quirky nature, goofy comedic style, and cheesecake &quot;sexy&quot; content.

Cosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu would receive a number of sequels and spin-offs, though it seems that Edia&#x27;s new collection will only be focusing on the original title and its ultra-rare, 1991 TurboGrafx-CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only release in the series to see a localized launch outside of Japan, so fans of M.I.A. titles — as well as the golden age of sci-fi anime — will no doubt be hoping that this collection will find its eventual way to western shores.
Crowdfunding on Makuake, Edia is looking to raise ¥3 million (or roughly $23,000 USD) and seems relatively confident that it will do so, given that the developer has already announced a launch date and price for the finished product. We will be sure to give you a heads up when more information is forthcoming. Cosmic Fantasy Collection is tentatively scheduled to launch in Japan December 2022 on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>&quot;Fixed an issue...&quot;
Nintendo just put out a minor Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes patch coinciding with its day one release today, and it&#x27;s thankfully fairly lean (having to grab a gigantic content patch right after getting the game would have been annoying).
It fixes, say it with me now, some issues! A few of them are even &quot;rare!&quot; The main one that sticks out is a problem with the save screen, which is also referred to as a &quot;rare&quot; problem: but one that even one total person would find devastating. You can read the full list here on Nintendo&#x27;s official site, or below.
Personally, I haven&#x27;t encountered any of these issues pre-launch, so folks should hopefully be good to go with it installed. Ideally, if a day one patch is in the cards, the powers that be will swiftly fix anything other people find as well. In a game as big as Three Hopes with as many party variations and missions, someone will likely find something the team missed.
Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes patch version 1.0.1 (Released June 23, 2022)
Fixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes at the end of an event.
Fixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes when moving from Base Camp to the War Map.
Fixed a rare issue where, after selecting a file to save to on the save screen, the screen does not change and progress is blocked.
Fixed an issue where progressing certain battles in certain sequences causes the player to get stuck and prevents progress.
Fixed an issue where using a Partner Special at certain times causes the Partner Special to not end and prevents progress.
Fixed an issue where the switch Lock On target control does not work when controlling the game with the left or right Joy-Con held horizontally.
Fixed various other issues to improve comfort of gameplay.

It’s about damned time. Natsume had some great games that were overlooked on the SNES, at least here in the west. It’s amazing to me that they’ve not only taken the time to port games like Wild Guns and Ninja Warriors, but they’ve gone to the effort of giving them upgrades courtesy of Tengo Project. After seeing the success with those titles (at least from a critical perspective, I don’t know how they did sales-wise), I was hopeful that they’d revisit one of my favorites: Pocky &amp; Rocky. I was afraid that the need to license from Taito would be a barrier, however.
Thankfully, we’ve now gotten exactly that, but while Wild Guns Reloaded and Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors were “enhanced remasters,” Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined is more of a sequel. Sort of. Mostly.…</span>

The BFFs and &quot;musicians,&quot; who battled it out month after month in a wild array of Splatfest events, resurfaced this morning via brand new artwork released by Nintendo. A short blurb informs fans that the duo has established an all-new backing band, monikering the new act &quot;Damp Socks feat. Off the Hook.&quot; Pearl &amp; Marina will be rocking vocals as always, with Marina demonstrating her newfound pianist skills, whilst rocking a smokin&#x27; orange power suit and dagger heels combo.

Stay Out of the House this July
It’s been listed on Steam for a hog’s age, but Stay Out of the House will finally be in the wider public’s hands in July. Part survival horror and part “stealth immersive sim,” Stay Out of the House places you in the clutches of a deranged serial killer. You’ll need to keep out of sight and find a way to escape his house.
Rather than a straight slasher game, Stay Out of the H…</span>

                              <span>A classic adventure remastered by Nightdive
One of Westwood&#x27;s classics is enhanced and available again, this time for modern hardware. Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is finally out today for PC and consoles.
Nightdive Studios put together this remastered version of the 1997 adventure classic. It&#x27;s available digitally on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on the Nintendo Switch. The Enhanced Edition is also getting a Limited Run physical version, too.
While Westwood may be known for its history in the real-time strategy genre, Blade Runner was its surprise adventure hit. It runs alongside the Ridley Scott film, weaving through the events of the movie. It has branching paths though, and has been well-remembered for both its style and impressive design.

Remastered dreams of electric sheep
Nightdive, the studio which has tackled other remasters like System Shock: Enhanced Edition, has put a few modern touches on Blade Runner. Since it&#x27;s coming to consoles, gamepad support is an obvious one.
The original Westwood videos have been upscaled to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. There is also an HD display, and a new clue interface. Plus, international fans can use the original foreign-language translations in Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese subtitles.
As for reception? Well, it currently seems iffy. Users on Steam are voting it into the Mostly Negative tier on launch day. Rock Paper Shotgun also had some words about this Enhanced Edition compared to other options, and provided some good comparison screenshots.
There is another version of the original Blade Runner just for PC, on GOG. So if your impressions of the Enhanced Edition are similarly tepid, you can at least pick that one up instead.

Patch 0.7.3 for Vampire Survivors is out today, and you know what that means: more characters, weapons, relics, Arcanas, and achievements to unlock. I&#x27;ve never fought so hard to maintain 100 percent completion in a game, but that just goes to show how quickly these updates are coming. I grind and grind, and the developers grind right back.
This trailer is a nice hazy attention-grabber, and I&#x27;ve got specifics below.

                              <span>With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.</span>

                              <span>In the movie Jurassic World Dominion, we see a company called Biosyn operating at full capacity, creating dinosaurs and other dangerous critters at an alarming pace. In Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s new expansion, Dominion Biosyn, you play through this corporation&#x27;s first days and learn how its hunger to bring back never-before-seen dinosaurs takes a turn for the worse.
My time in Biosyn&#x27;s sprawling dinosaur sanctuary was short yet rewarding. The new campaign flows harmlessly from mission to mission, allowing for success with little pushback. Some dinosaurs get sick or may misbehave, but this is essentially a stress-free playthrough that lets you interact with a handful of fantastic new dinosaurs within just an hour or two.
All of the Biosyn dinosaurs are fantastic additions, bringing the r…</span>

                              <span>Jupiter looms large, serving as an imposing backdrop as cargo ship pilot Jacob Lee crashes on the Gas Giant’s second-biggest moon. Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.
Set 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.
In 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.

                              <span>coverage here.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.
When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.

Rather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.
While Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.
Also of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.
Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there&#x27;s plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players&#x27; abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 
However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn&#x27;t free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.
If you&#x27;re still on the fence about whether to check out Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, read our review to better inform your potential purchasing decision.</span>

                              <span>In an interview with 4Gamer.net, Elden Ring director and president of From Software, Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealed some information about the studio&#x27;s next project and even left some room for the possibility of an Elden Ring sequel. Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.
Regarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year&#x27;s smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don&#x27;t have to wait too long to see what it is. When asked whether that other game was still in development, Miyazaki responded, &quot;Yes. Development is in its final stages.&quot;

                              <span>Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
For those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” 
Speaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
Regardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).

It was a weird setup, but the end result was a slightly clunky, yet kind of fun GTA-like open-world game. Apparently it did well enough that a sequel began development, but it was never finished. However, new footage…

Updated with Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes. Remember that this is a dynamic reader-ranked list that re-orders automatically depending on each game&#x27;s rating in our database. Three Hopes is a new title, but having thoroughly enjoyed it (as you can read about in our review), we imagine it will rise through the ranks pretty quickly as more people play and rate it.
In order to rate any of the games on the list below out of 10, logged-in Nintendo Life users can simply tap the &#x27;star&#x27; and assign each game a personal rating. Enjoy!

This review originally went live in 2016, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival on Switch as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

There are moments during Pokémon Snap where — upon finding a hidden path — the game ditches the first-person perspective to show your character looking on in amazement at the new discovery. Despite being a (relatively) low-poly Nintendo 64 release, the game still manages to convey a sense of wonder, something it does throughout your time with it. That sense dulls which subsequent replays, but there&#x27;s a lot happening in the stages which makes the experience a lot more engrossing than you might imagine if you&#x27;ve never snapped a &#x27;mon before.

Earlier today, Sega announced the next 11 games coming to the company&#x27;s next mini console, the Mega Drive Mini 2. But that&#x27;s not the only thing it revealed during the latest livestream.
In a bit of a surprise announcement, Sega unveiled a new USB controller — based on the classic SHARP Cyber Stick — that will be compatible with the tiny console. The controller was known for having both digital and analogue joystick modules, and it was compatible with multiple systems including the X68000, the PC98 series, and the PC Engine (if you had the Micomsoft XHE-3 adaptor).

Rumours of an upcoming Nintendo Direct continue to swirl, with many believing Nintendo&#x27;s next major showcase to occur on June 29th after a rather confident statement from Sony Santa Monica writer Alanah Pearce.
Adding fire to the rumour, it looks like the My Nintendo Store for the UK will be undergoing planned maintenance from Monday, June 27th to Wednesday June 29th, meaning the website will be inaccessible during this time (thanks for the tip, SwitchplayerJohn!).

Walking out into the arena of Pokémon Black &amp; White 2’s Pokémon World Tournament (PWT) for the first time, I had chills. The lights were dimmed, the crowd was watching, and the commentary was introducing me – my character – as if I were some sort of celebrity. Well, sure, I’d saved Unova and become the Champion of the region. But here, right now, I was facing the best of the best. I couldn’t fall flat on my face here.
My character stepped onto the stage. I took one deep breath and my opponent, Cheren, the first Gym Leader, looked me dead in the eye. This was only the first fight, but I had to win. I had to become the very best. Because what lay in waiting after beating all of Unova’s Gym Leaders again was the chance for ultimate personal glory.

But if you own the game on Switch, and started up your system today, you may have noticed this monster collecting game received a surprise update. And, if you booted up the game, you might discover that The Forgotten World is live.

                              <span>COPE.
One particularly bright spot in Sonic&#x27;s recent history was the release of Sonic Mania. One part sequel and one part reimagining of the 2D classics, that retro revival proved to be one of the best-rated and best-selling Sonic projects in recent years. In the (frankly baffling) absence of a true follow-up to Sonic Mania, Sega has instead opted to look to that game’s inspiration for Sonic’s latest 2D release. Billed as Sonic Origins, this new collection presents all the original four Sonic games—including the rarely re-released Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles—in enhanced widescreen format with the new option to treat all the 2D entries as if they were all one big game. The end result is, well, exactly what you’d expect. All these classic Sonic games look better than ever with their new presentation and some light quality of life updates, but those of you who have already run through Green Hill Zone more times than you can count may be left wishing for a little more.
Clearly, the main draw of this package is the original 16-bit platformers and we’re happy to report that they each remain tremendously enjoyable in their own way. There’s good reason why so many Sonic fans remember these games so fondly (and perhaps a little longingly), and that’s because these games really got what Sonic is all about. No overwrought stories and bizarre self-insert characters here, just a blue dude with a ‘tude who fights an evil mustache man to save a bunch of animals and, eventually, the world.

Splatoon 3 is due for release on Nintendo Switch this coming September and Nintendo is consistently releasing new information, footage, and music from the game to ramp up excitement.
The latest info dump is in the form of a new song from the fictional band &#x27;Damp Socks&#x27; called &#x27;Candy-Coated Rocks&#x27;. It&#x27;s very much your quintessential Splatoon music and fits in well with the theme of the franchise.

Sonic Origins&#x27; launch yesterday saw the return of the blue blurs classic Mega Drive/Genesis games, all bundled together on modern consoles. The most noteworthy part of the bundle is Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, which sees Sonic 3 ported to consoles with new, HD upgrades for the first time.
To help make this version possible, Headcannon — one of the developers behind the wonderful Sonic Mania — worked together with Sega to recreate the classic interlocking duo in the Retro Engine. Now that the collection is out, Stealth — the alias of Headcannon&#x27;s Simon Thomley — has acknowledged some of the problems with the final release and shared some of the complications behind them on Twitter.

Motion Twin and Evil Empire&#x27;s fantastic roguelike Dead Cells has received another new update as of yesterday, and it&#x27;s a pretty important one too.
The studios have partnered with AbleGamers and members of the Dead Cells community to help bring in tons of new accessibility features to the game. A spokesperson for Evil Empire said that &quot;The intent of this update is to allow players who struggle to, or cannot play, Dead Cells to be able to experience the game as we intended. We had feedback during beta testing that some people who don’t ‘need’ Assist Mode will use it regardless and the result is that they won’t play Dead Cells as a challenging roguelike.&quot;

Nintendo previously hinted at the new tour with a rather delightful piece of artwork via Twitter:

Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment have confirmed A Plague Tale: Requiem will be coming to the Nintendo Switch as a cloud version release on 18th October this year. This was announced earlier on at the latest &#x27;Focus Showcase&#x27; alongside an extended gameplay trailer.

Here&#x27;s a bit about the latest gameplay trailer from the PR. Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t share it here on Nintendo Life due to the age restrictions in place.

                              <span>Pokusů o zapnutí optimalizace kódu jádra kompilátorem pomocí přepínače -O3 bylo již hodně. V současnosti se jádro překládá s přepínačem -O2, jen pro exotickou architekturu ARC (Argonaut RISCS Core) je tu možnost zapnout -O3. Také Linus Torvalds byl proti zapnutí -O3. Argumentuje se často horším a pomalejším kódem při použití GCC.</span>

                              <span>The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I&#x27;m honest. Even the ones I&#x27;ve enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren&#x27;t the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it&#x27;s precisely because it&#x27;s not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It&#x27;s not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it&#x27;s all the more faithful for that.

                              <span>In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I&#x27;m willing to bet that &quot;pluviophile&quot; would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I&#x27;m doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I&#x27;ll be out frolicking in the downpour before they&#x27;ve hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can&#x27;t. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It&#x27;s time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you&#x27;ll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature&#x27;s greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s time to frolick. No umbrella required.

                              <span>A pair of new hidden object games have a pleasingly straightforward name to describe their inception: I Commissioned Some Bees. The developer paid illustrators to draw pictures with bees, and you can find the bees. It&#x27;s quite fun to find the bees. I got into hidden object games a few years back with the lovely Hidden Folks and the vast 100 Hidden X series, and today have enjoyed poring over colourful and often surreal landscapes to find our striped friends.

                              <span>We finally got our first glimpse of Starfield at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase at Summer Geoff Fest, having seen lots of clips of Todd Howard speaking words with devs who nodded across tables. I partly share the same opinion as Alice Bee, who thought the game could&#x27;ve shown us anything and they chose grey rocks again.
What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was to feel a bit emotional about the game&#x27;s reveal, though. I mean, I felt this weird swell in my chest of excitement or something. Maybe it was the crushing jet lag, or maybe it was a heady mixture of nostalgia. Let&#x27;s investigate.

                              <span>Into The Breach was our second favourite game of 2018 and remains the best strategy game ever made. So it&#x27;s exciting news that Into The Breach: Advanced Edition is coming next month with new mechs, weapons and enemies to shove around in a free update.

                              <span>As odd as it might sound, there has long been an urban legend that Michael Jackson was involved in creating part of the soundtrack for Sonic 3. Now Sonic creator and Sonic 3 programmer Yuji Naka has seemed to lend credence to that legend on Twitter, as it relates to the replacement of certain tracks in the recently released remasters in Sonic Origins.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell &quot;Requiem&quot;. The second is &#x27;What would it be like if you had the power of rats?&#x27;. The third is, &#x27;What if rats had any power to have?&#x27;. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called &#x27;What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn&#x27;t delayed until next year?&#x27;.

                              <span>There are two reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

                              <span>Valve are kicking off 2022’s Steam Summer Sale today with discounts on AAA and indie games, starting at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST. It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.

                              <span>The RTX 3060 is the best value 1080p graphics card, and recently it&#x27;s gotten significantly cheaper as next-gen Nvidia GPUs have been rumoured. Right now, you can pick up a Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle 12GB for just £330 at Scan UK, a £61 reduction over the same card at Amazon UK and some £40 cheaper than the cheapest RTX 3060 we spotted last month. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new GPU and you&#x27;ve got a 1080p monitor, this is an awesome shout.

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

That&#x27;s a £50 reduction from its normal price, and some £22 cheaper than the CPU and cooler on Amazon. This would make an excellent start to a new system, with the 3600&#x27;s six cores and twelve threads pairing well with a modern RTX 20-series or Radeon RX 5000-series or later graphics card.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t tend to be biased towards games just because they&#x27;re new, so I feel it carries some weight when I say that The Sims 4 Werewolves Game Pack has immediately become one of my favourite add-ons for The Sims 4. Having been a fan of the Vampires and Realm Of Magic (a.k.a. wizards, basically) game packs since their respective releases, I can safely say that Werewolves has done an excellent job iterating and expanding on what worked from those previous supernatural outings.

                              <span>I was in LA for Summer Geoff Fest and I played a whole bunch of games. No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren&#x27;t too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

                              <span>Former Ubisoft developer Charles Randall has been spilling the beans about the original Assassin’s Creed on Twitter again. This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

One of the principles of good character design is recognizability, and part of that is what a character is wearing. Can you tell which character it&#x27;s supposed to be just based on their outfit? Better yet, can you tell who they are based on one article of clothing? It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the most iconic pieces of clothing in video games also come from some of the best titles ever made.
Fashion has been a pretty casual hobby for me, but it really is something I love — the clothes we choose to wear can tell the world so much about us, and in this case, the clothes that the developers choose for the characters in games tell us a lot about them.
Some examples that immediately come to mind for me are Chell&#x27;s jumpsuit from Portal, Clementine&#x27;s hat from The Walking Dead, or M…</span>

FTL developer Subset Games is at it again with another long-after-launch Advanced Edition, this time for its excellent tactical mech game Into the Breach. And beyond a free content update, strategy fans are also getting a physical Nintendo Switch edition of Into the Breach (via Fangamer) and an iOS and Android version (via Netflix). Busy day!
As the developers outlined on their website, Into the Breach Advanced Edition touches on &quot;nearly every aspect of the game.&quot; Notably, that means five new mech squads, including four new pilots and nearly 40 new weapons, as well as &quot;more enemies, more bosses, and more mission objectives that add additional challenge and variety to any run.&quot;

There&#x27;s been some confusion surrounding the state of the Overwatch franchise recently, especially when it comes to what will happen to the original after Overwatch 2 is released. Well, it looks like we finally have our confirmation, thanks to a Reddit AMA response from Overwatch 2&#x27;s director Aaron Keller. Yesterday, when a player asked Keller if the first Overwatch will be shut down after the sequel leaves early access, he responded that &quot;When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.&quot;
If Twitter is any indication, players are still pretty confused about what&#x27;s supposed to happen to the first Overwatch game after OW2 is officially out.
Back when Overwatch 2 was announced, former game director Jeff Kaplan had promised th…</span>

It&#x27;s that time of year again. The Steam Summer Sale 2022 is live right now, with some deep discounts on dozens upon dozens of games.
From now until July 7 at 10 a.m. PT, developers and publishers are putting their games on various levels of sales.
And of course, there is a side-game as well. One section brings up a message from time-traveler Clorthax, who has &quot;stolen the ten best games from the far future&quot; and brought them back to sell on Steam.
It&#x27;s essentially a scavenger hunt, it seems, with clues and hints for finding a game. It&#x27;s a neat little side-venture to engage with across the days of deals.

Because time no longer exists, it has already been a whole fortnight since we all sat down to watch Geoff Keighley and an array of publishers and developers showcase their wares during the Summer Game Fest live stream — and it appears that the show has been a tremendous success, breaking its own viewership records for the third year running.
According to a tweet posted by host and organizer Keighley, Summer Game Fest 2022 — which broadcast on the afternoon of June 9 — hit a peak concurrent 3.5 million viewers during the course of its 90-minute runtime. Over 6,000 accounts co-streamed the broadcast, while &quot;Twitter Conversation&quot; was up 100% on last year&#x27;s stream, with the usage of &quot;#thegameawards&quot; hashtag up by 69%. Nice.
https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1539641914810572800?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;6MQpfa6v2i_FLxnf0HoA5g
Over the course of the Summer Game Fest stream, viewers were able to check out new trailers, news, reveals, and updates on a wide variety of titles currently in development for PC and consoles.
Among the many games featured we saw a trailer for Guile in Street Fighter 6, footage of space horror The Callisto Project, a cinematic for Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, a release date for TMNT: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, campaign footage from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, footage of Nightwing kicking ass in Gotham Knights, and the long-awaited reveal of Naughty Dog remake The Last of Us Part I, which had, unfortunately, been leaked mere minutes before the show began.
Summer Game Fest will return in June of 2023. Before then, we can expect to see Keighley do his stage show thang thing at Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live stream on August 24, and, of course, at The Game Awards 2023, which is scheduled to take place this winter.

The Nintendo eShop has got a sale on, and it&#x27;s a pretty big one at that. The Big Ol&#x27; Super Sale on the eShop has some solid deals for those looking to fill out their Nintendo Switch backlog.
Running now until July 6 at 11:59 p.m. PT, several staples of the Nintendo Switch library are on sale. For Nintendo fans in particular this is a good one, as several Nintendo first-party games are seeing discounts.
Super Mario Odyssey, for example, is up for 30% off. The remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening is down 30% as well, as is Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Super Mario Maker 2.
If third-party is more your speed, there are some fairly deep discounts there too. Persona 5 Strikers and No More Heroes 3 are both 50% off, a sizable discount. And Doom Eternal rolls in at a whopping 67% off.

With its new Breaking Barriers update, Dead Cells has added a long list of granular accessibility options — including an Assist Mode — to help struggling players pummel the Hand of the King and ultimately rise the (Boss Cells) ranks. It&#x27;s been a long time coming, and for anyone who feels like they&#x27;ve peaked in the game, it&#x27;s time to circle back.
Using Assist Mode toggles, it&#x27;s now possible to reveal the biome&#x27;s map, auto-hit enemies with your primary melee weapon, auto-destroy nearby doors, give yourself more wiggle room to land parries, and make traps slower. Similar to Rogue Legacy 2&#x27;s House Rules, there are also sliders — you can lower trap damage, enemy health, and enemy damage.

The Justice Department reports that, for the first time, anti-piracy efforts were also carried out in the &#x27;metaverse&#x27;; although it&#x27;s unclear what that means exactly.

                              <span>Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.
The publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.
The result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. 
Although Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.</span>

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next hero would be Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor. A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.
Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane&#x27;s powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans&#x27; appetite for the character&#x27;s Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. 
It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane&#x27;s moveset from Thor&#x27;s. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that&#x27;s something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem finally arrives on October 18, Focus Entertainment announced today during a special broadcast. The release confirmation comes alongside an extended gameplay showing that follows Amicia and Hugo as they attempt to escape an enemy-laden quarry.
You can watch the new demo below to get an in-game look at a slice of the game’s story, as the siblings are pursued by soldiers. This leads to a good showing of the game&#x27;s stealth as the pair sneak around the quarry. Amicia also gets her hands dirty taking out enemies in a showcase of the game&#x27;s action. 


Additionally, a video showcasing the game’s previously announced $189.99 Collector’s Editon provides up-close looks at the Amicia and Hugo resin statue. 


A Plague Tale: Requiem will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also be playable on Switch via cloud streaming.</span>

                              <span>The Biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monstrous antagonists, are as mysterious as they are deadly. To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. 
Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.
“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn&#x27;t have to be real, but it has to feel real, right? That can mean many different things. But in my opinion, it has to be interesti…</span>

                              <span>Welcome back to a new episode of The Game Informer Show! We know what you&#x27;re thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won&#x27;t stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we&#x27;re brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.
Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today&#x27;s podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

                              <span>Update: Yuji Naka has, kind of, walked back his original, unintentional confirmation that Michael Jackson worked on Sonic 3 after years of vaguely proven speculation.  
In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3&#x27;s music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson&#x27;s connection to it. In a follow-up tweet, he posted: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don&#x27;t speak English and I&#x27;m using a translation tool. Sorry.&quot;

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky creator Hello Games has teamed up with Bandai Namco to bring its hit survival title to the Nintendo Switch. We knew from a Nintendo Direct that aired earlier this year the game was coming to the portable console before today&#x27;s announcement. However, the last mention of the project came with a summer release window, which has now been pushed back. But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man&#x27;s Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. 
Fans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.


Looking over the titles&#x27;s long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.
 No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Switch and PS5 remastered editions are set to release on October 7, but you can also purchase a copy of the game on all major platforms.</span>

Another long-awaited physical edition is coming to the Nintendo Switch this year, as tactical strategy game Into The Breach gets printed onto cartridges at last.
The physical edition, which is being published by Fangamer, includes a folded poster of a Rift Walker, inside cover art, a 3.3&quot; by 4.5&quot; manual, two sticker sheets, and the game cartridge, which will come with all previous updates as well as the Advanced Edition update that comes out in July.

                              <span>Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.</span>

                              <span>Sega&#x27;s Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and &quot;engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.&quot; The game&#x27;s debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet&#x27;s culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth&#x27;s poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it&#x27;s still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas&#x27; alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.</span>

                              <span>Glen Schoefield has made a name for himself, working on Dead Space, Call of Duty, and even Barbie: Game Girl. Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It&#x27;s Alex Stadnik&#x27;s turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we&#x27;ll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn&#x27;t Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You&#x27;ll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you&#x27;ll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.</span>

                              <span>Believe it or not, The Callisto Protocol is a scary game. But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs &quot;horror engineering.&quot; 
Horror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three. Imagine Disney’s Imagineering process applied to something much more gruesome. 
Horror engineering stems from the team’s desire to make The Callisto …</span>

Square Enix debuted a new Final Fantasy XVI trailer during a recent PlayStation State of Play. It was our biggest look yet at the upcoming RPG and the trailer revealed that Final Fantasy XVI is due out sometime during the summer of next year.

The director&#x27;s legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company&#x27;s claims fall flat. The Pulp Fiction film is a derivative of the screenplay, not the other way around, they stress.

Today the men pleaded guilty and both face up to 10 years in prison. Kim Dotcom - who is not part of the deal - congratulated his former friends last month but now accuses them of facilitating Chinese spying.

                              <span>When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that&#x27;s very boring, but it&#x27;s also positive, isn&#x27;t it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I&#x27;ll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it&#x27;s directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it&#x27;s going to be accessible if you&#x27;re new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it&#x27;s possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

                              <span>Now that all the unusually stressful benchmarking is out the way, let’s talk how mineral-grubbing “quest shooter” The Cycle: Frontier performs on PC. Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

However, the automatically applied update is primarily intended to sort out a variety of daft-sounding exploits. These range from teleporting back to your spawn point by changing loadout or class while touching the other team’s No Entry gate, to Spies disguising themselves and creating an invisible shield at their feet to block incoming fire.

The game soft-launched with a pre-season on June 8th, so its transition into the first season seems to consist largely of the launch of its Fortuna battle pass. Here’s a trailer detailing what the pass entails, below.

The Basilisk Ultimate normally oscillates between $140 and a sale price of $90, but today it&#x27;s gone lower - it&#x27;s $80 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a pretty solid price for what you&#x27;re getting!

It has gained even more attention in the last day or so, because its creation reunites some of the people who worked on AM2R, the well-liked unofficial Metroid 2 remake that Nintendo DMCA&#x27;d out of existence in 2016.

It&#x27;s a tycoon factory builder about forming a technology company and leading it, from product design through hiring staff and all the way to replacing those staff with robots. It looks cute and, as of its departure from Steam Early Access today, robust.

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It&#x27;s not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

                              <span>I love the name &quot;SpellForce&quot;, mid-word capital letter and all. It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

                              <span>Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

                              <span>Yesterday I wrote about eco-strategy game Terra Nil’s demo, which went gangbusters during last week’s Steam Next Fest and shot up into the top 50 most played games on Valve’s storefront. Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

                              <span>So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified &quot;violation of related laws and regulations&quot;.

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

                              <span>The Acter Nitro 5 is a strong if unremarkable gaming laptop, offering excellent performance for the money in a rather typical gamer-y design. It doesn&#x27;t look quite as cool as a Razer Blade or as beautifully thick as an XMG Apex 15, but it&#x27;s got it where it counts: inside. Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…</span>

                              <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, &quot;Chaotic Great Edition.&quot; The latter includes the game&#x27;s season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. &quot;This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,&quot; Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland is really good. As we said, it&#x27;s &quot;upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. 
Of course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there&#x27;s more to it than PlayStation&#x27;s ever-growing list of really expensive games.
I had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. 
To my delight, it&#x27;s full of weirdo games you probably haven&#x27;t heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of &quot;Does this look weird and/or interesting?&quot; It&#x27;s been a blast. 
I finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It&#x27;s also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. 
I also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It&#x27;s an objectively bad game but I can&#x27;t help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she&#x27;s evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it&#x27;s bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.
Next up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can&#x27;t wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you&#x27;re finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that&#x27;s a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.


Join Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn&#x27;s dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what&#x27;s happening on the moon.
While that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can&#x27;t go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you&#x27;ll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.
If that&#x27;s not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.

                              <span>Remakes of Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. 
According to Hawk, the &quot;plan&quot; was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. 
&quot;The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn&#x27;t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,&quot; Hawk says in the clip. &quot;Like, &#x27;What would you do with a THPS title?&#x27; And they didn&#x27;t like anything they heard, and then that was it.&quot;
You can watch the full clip below: 
Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔

At the very least, it doesn&#x27;t sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision&#x27;s interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that&#x27;s been a bad idea.  
The news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  &quot;the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.&quot; Alas, history proves otherwise. 
But actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there&#x27;s Vicarious Visions&#x27; Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater reboot. There&#x27;s also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.</span>

                              <span>Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won&#x27;t hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you&#x27;ll get his lightsaber as a reward.
Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It&#x27;ll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.
Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He&#x27;s also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. 
His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don&#x27;t know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it&#x27;s awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here&#x27;s hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!</span>

                              <span>RiotPWR has revealed a new controller specifically designed for Xbox cloud gaming on mobile devices, and it looks great. 
RiotPWR is no stranger to creating controllers with mobile gaming in mind, but today’s reveal is the result of a collaboration and partnership with Xbox. The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. 


“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” 
This controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1.

Developed by Hairbrained Schemes and Codeglue and published by Paradox Interactive, these strategic RPGs draw heavily from the boardgame universe and have great stories to tell. The trilogy consists of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director&#x27;s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition.
In Game Informer&#x27;s review of Shadowrun Returns, Matt Miller says the &quot;isometric view, turn-based combat, point-and-click controls, and text-driven dialogue deliver a jolt of nostalgia for longtime PC gamers. Fifteen years ago, games like this established the foundations of today’s Western RPGs. Even so, there’s nothing here that should turn away newcomers thanks to smart updates t…</span>

While fans often debate the merits of modern Sonic the Hedgehog video games, the consensus is that the ‘90s were the franchise’s most consistently great years. Sonic Origins gathers the four games most attributed to that notion, delivering a stellar group of classic titles at its core. But through several modernizations and updates, Sonic Origins makes a strong case for being the best official way to experience Sonic’s heyday in 2022.

Prozatím jde zjevně o řešení pro nadšence, Lenovo samo upozorňuje, že spektrum aplikací běžících nativně na ARM verzi Windows se teprve rozšiřuje. Berme ale tento model jako zajímavou vlaštovku, kterou možná PC svět reaguje na příchod Apple M1 (Pro, Max, Ultra) a M2.</span>

These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I&#x27;ve found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

                              <span>I realised earlier that today was the last day of Steam Next Fest, and I panicked. I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn&#x27;t the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I&#x27;ve left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

                              <span>The blue hedgehog is back! He goes very fast in his latest instalment, Sonic Frontiers! And lots of fans – naturally – think it looks terrible! The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I&#x27;d like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance &#x27;em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron&#x27;s tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that&#x27;s your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they&#x27;re shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

                              <span>Dinosaurs are cool and scary right? Spiders aren’t so great but they’re definitely biologically intimidating to humans too. Combine the two and you get Shantae developers WayForward’s Spidersaurs, which describes itself as a 2D co-op run’n’gun action game. It’s coming to Steam soon, say WayForward. Try not to get the theme tune stuck in your head when you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Of all the demos featured in this past week’s Steam Next Fest, indie environmental ‘reverse city-builder’ Terra Nil has performed exceedingly well for itself. The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

Details of the stipulated consent judgement between the two companies, which has yet to be signed off by the court, were reported by Torrentfreak.

While the defendants are likely to be somewhat upset, major Hollywood studios are absolutely fuming. Despite their lawsuit against Nitro being filed months earlier, it&#x27;s still not over, allowing DISH to strike first against any available cash.

                              <span>Hot off the reveal that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 is called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about remakes, their purpose in video games, and what games need and don’t need them. 
As a bottom line, I’m not opposed to any remake. If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that. 


However, all this talk and speculation…</span>

                              <span>It’s been a wild month of video game announcements, updates, trailers, and more courtesy of June’s gaming showcase schedule. Between the 2022 Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase, Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, and the third-party PlayStation State of Play, people have been expecting Nintendo to announce its own June gaming direct. 
And it finally has, but it might not be the more general one you were expecting. That’s because Nintendo has revealed that a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 direct is happening this week. 
Tune in on 6/22 at 7am PT for a livestreamed #XenobladeChronicles3 Direct presentation featuring roughly 20 minutes of information about the upcoming RPG adventure for #NintendoSwitch. pic.twitter.com/x3pRs0EYRA
June 20, 2022
As you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. 
While waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July.

What would happen to Gotham City if Batman stopped protecting it? We&#x27;ll soon find out in Warner Bros. Montreal&#x27;s Gotham Knights, a story-based action/RPG that begins with Batman&#x27;s death. As criminals try to take advantage of Batman&#x27;s absence, his understudies are trying to keep order. Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing unite to maintain order, but quickly learn Gotham now bends to the will of the mysterious Court of Owls.
I talked to Gotham Knights&#x27; executive producer Fleur Marty and game director Geoff Ellenor about what players can expect to experience from this…</span>

                              <span>Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. 
Now, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. 
Check it out for yourself below: 

As you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 
For more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West.

That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning. This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. Organi confirmed that most of the lyrics are gibberish, and they even apparently reached out to an Elden Ring music producer to verify their findings.


“I am a Latin student, and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs,” Organi writes on the PlayStation 5 subreddit. “The fir…</span>

                              <span>First-person tactical shooter Ready Or Not disappeared from Steam on June 16th, prompting a flurry of rumours as to why. Now it&#x27;s back and the developers say that the removal was because a &quot;takedown request was issued via Steam concerning a suggested trademark infringement in our recent Night Club map.&quot;

                              <span>Throwback first-person shooters are penny a bushel at the moment, but while most aim to replicate the boomsticks of Quake, Agent 64: Spies Never Die mimics the PPKs and hacking gadgetry of another 90&#x27;s classic. Maybe the name gives it away: it&#x27;s Rare&#x27;s GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64, and there&#x27;s currently a demo available to play as part of the Steam Next Fest.

Still, the Steam Next Fest is underway, with so many great demos to try out if you can maintain your corporeal form this weekend. So what are you playing this weekend?

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.
Releasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come.

                              <span>An amusing irony of working an anti-piracy job is that people immediately render themselves redundant when they&#x27;re 100% effective. With that scenario unlikely to ever raise its head, anti-piracy jobs are in abundance. Whether you prefer site-blocking,  IPTV disruption, or just want camcording movie pirates brought to justice, there is no shortage of jobs in the UK right now.

                              <span>Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot&#x27;s announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You&#x27;d be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM&#x27;s Toomgis? How about with the McDonald&#x27;s Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. 
The Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. 
Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. 
Another Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It&#x27;s far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin&#x27;s best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development.

                              <span>E3 2022, of course, didn&#x27;t take place. Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there&#x27;s something about the current setup for the game industry&#x27;s biggest info dump of the year that&#x27;s leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.
What I&#x27;d like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…</span>

The first original IP developed by the prolific studio in over 25 years, Starfield is expected to redefine science fiction RPGs with unparalleled ambition, boasting considerable customization options and scale. I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. 
Sunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets. All open for you to explore.” On cue, the camera zoomed out, revealing countless nodes on an overwhelmingly extensiv…</span>

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is coming to consoles and PC later this year as an Early Access free-to-play title. With that change in business model, Blizzard Entertainment is now offering a bundle for the unreleased game with plenty of cosmetics and extras, including beta access. However, it&#x27;s going to set you back about the full price of a game.
Clocking in at $39.99, Overwatch 2&#x27;s first content bundle, dubbed the Overwatch Watchpoint Pack, does include a game you can play right now. It&#x27;s the Legendary Edition of the original Overwatch which comes with some additional skins for characters and is probably necessary for the next piece of the bundle; purchasers will also be granted access to the upcoming Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28. When the game launches into Early Access proper in October, the Watchpoint Pack covers the cost of the initial season pass and grants skins, in-game currency, and more.
Here are the entire contents of the Watchpoint Pack: 
Guaranteed access to the Overwatch 2 PvP Crossplay Beta (Beta begins June 28th, 2022)
Overwatch: Legendary Edition (includes five (5) Legendary Skins and five (5) Epic Skins)
Additional content granted to purchasers at the release of Overwatch 2 on October 4th
Premium Battle Pass: Season 1 - Two (2) Overwatch
2 Legendary Hero Skins - Space Raider Soldier 76 and Space Raider Cassidy
2000 Overwatch 2 Virtual Currency - Overwatch
2 Player Icon (Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack pre-purchase exclusive)
The Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack is available on all platforms Overwatch 2 which will be available: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Early Access of OW2 starts on October 4, and includes a new character, The Junker Queen. Our own Brian Shea spoke with the Overwatch team about this upcoming game and shift to free-to-play, and you can read his preview of it here.</span>

                              <span>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, the 2007 prequel to Final Fantasy VII, is getting a modern facelift in the form of Reunion. 
The updated version of the PSP classic features HD visuals and updated character models. It also includes full voiceover and a rearranged soundtrack. If FFVII Remake was your first experience with this franchise and you asked yourself who the heck that black-haired guy was, this is the game you&#x27;ll want to play. 
Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion launches this Winter for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

                              <span>Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, Rebirth, during today&#x27;s 25th Anniversary presentation. It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?
It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.

The industry group filed a lawsuit against the music video maker Vinkle and sent cease-and-desist letters to nearly 100 other infringing apps. Meanwhile, Google and Apple are put on formal notice and requested to take swift action.

Cloudflare has now fired back, describing the move as a legally unstable &quot;power grab,&quot; but that&#x27;s just the beginning. Overnight, Google, EFF, and industry group CCIA intervened to express concern over the scale of the injunctions.

                              <span>Not E3 2022 is over. It&#x27;s done. I think? I mean there&#x27;s a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can&#x27;t start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point. Do you want to live in a world where Geoff Keighley
 is allowed to drop a World Premiere at 4PM on Christmas Day? It doesn&#x27;t bear thinking about, really, does it.

                              <span>There&#x27;s something so intriguing about a new survival game. You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

                              <span>As I might have mentioned once or twice, one of my joys in life is dipping and drifting around rivers and ponds, lochs and seas. I am delighted to see some of the gentle pleasure and wonder of that captured in Naiad, an upcoming game about a water spirit adventuring downstream. It has a free demo in the Steam Next Fest, and it is quite lovely. I believe it to be what the youth call &#x27;wholesome&#x27;.

                              <span>I confess, I was worried about revolutionary robot Soulslike Steelrising. I&#x27;d seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it&#x27;s all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

Thank you once again from the bottom of our massive elephant hearts to our lovely supporters, who let us have lovely silly chats like this.

He went with DMC. But that punchfest has been out for years so...? Yes! Capcom last night announced Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, following a nice presentation where the devs reminisced about making the first game.

                              <span>Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that &quot;an objective review&quot; from external advisors &quot;determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence &quot;suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board.&quot;
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that &quot;there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units&quot; in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, &quot;based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.&quot; You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.

                              <span>Square Enix’s 25th anniversary livestream for Final Fantasy VII played out in almost textbook fashion for the JRPG giants, starting and ending with the two most important pieces of news for PC players. First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part. Gawp at Sephiroth’s broad shoulders from behind by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Resident Evil modders have had an eventful week. First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All&#x27;s well that ends well, though. In response to &quot;overwhelming community response&quot;, Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

                              <span>I am, at present, the world record holder on one level in Neon White. Admittedly, &quot;world record&quot; is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I&#x27;ve had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I&#x27;ve stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

                              <span>My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it&#x27;s a little short on narrative flavour, unless you&#x27;re really into exploring the setting, it&#x27;s got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

Imogen (RPS in peace) spoke with him earlier this year about the game&#x27;s gaslamp fantasy setting and why they chose to enter the survival genre gauntlet, among many other things. At this year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game&#x27;s recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

Rebecca from our guides team has been doing exhaustive work doing live chats and roundups for almost all the streams, and Edders was actually out in Los Angeles to play some games and chat to people.

It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it? Anger Foot is a game about kicking doors at muppet men. That’s it. That’s the pitch. It rules.

                              <span>Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

                              <span>DDR5 RAM arrived late last year, but it&#x27;s taken until now to see the first semi-reasonable prices for a kit of next-generation memory. CCL are currently selling a kit of Crucial DDR5-4800 for £89.94, more than £30 cheaper than the same kit is on Amazon. 
This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a DDR5 kit of any description under £100, so if you&#x27;re considering a 12th-gen Intel (or AMD Ryzen 7000) build, then this might be just what you need.

It has a demo in the Steam Next Fest and I think I want more? I was drawn in by screenshots of vast Gothic architecture, put off by frustrating slowness, then kept interested by the mysteries of our fella adrift in his former home. It does, at the very least, have pleasingly giant buildings rising from fog.

We touched on the game&#x27;s &quot;beta paths&quot;, its gore system, upgrades, and batteries. There was a lot of chat about batteries. Forgot to ask if they were AA or AAA, though.

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a sidescrolling beat ‘em up that aims to recapture the spirit of the TMNT arcade games from decades past, is both incredibly simple and a breath of fresh air. It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn&#x27;t know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

                              <span>Retro-futuristic RPG pentequel Fallout 5 will be Bethesda’s next project after they complete work on The Elder Scrolls 6, development leader Todd Howard has confirmed in an interview with IGN. You might have to wait for some years to see anything from it though, as The Elder Scrolls 6 is only in “pre-production”. We’ll all be sporting Methuselah-length beards and have popped all the achievements in Starfield’s umpteenth DLC by then.

                              <span>V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

                              <span>First released in 1987 - back when Games Workshop were, arguably, much more fun than they are today - Rogue Trader was the first edition of what would eventually become tabletop miniature megachonker Warhammer 40,000. Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting&#x27;s first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

                              <span>How much should a 1440p 144Hz monitor cost, a good one, when it&#x27;s on sale? Normally the answer is around $300, but today Monoprice have gone one further. Their Zero-G 27-in 1440p 144Hz curved monitor has dropped from $250 to $190 - mere pocket change*! 
Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

                              <span>The RTX 2060 isn&#x27;t the new hotness that it was a few years ago, but a global pandemic and chip shortage means that the card is still a surprisingly capable option three years later. The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you&#x27;re willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That&#x27;s a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

A well-considered and highly logical decision handed down by a judge in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court this week will also be of interest to those facing Voltage lawsuits elsewhere, the UK in particular.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
