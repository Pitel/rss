                              <span>Roblox annually ends with a wintery celebration commemorating all the popular festive events. This year&#x27;s extravaganza places every hit game into one place, where you can earn holiday-themed items for the season. Here&#x27;s everything you need to know about the Roblox Winter Spotlight event, including games, token quests, and an end date.


All Roblox Winter Spotlight games and Token quests


When you first slide down into the Roblox Winter Spotlight event, you&#x27;ll discover a Token for the Winter Skies Beanie. From then on, you can earn rewards the old-fashioned way by completing quests in various games. There are two types of Tokens you&#x27;ll encounter: Regular and Elite. While you&#x27;ll collect Regular types through each game&#x27;s standard missions, the Elite aims to challenge you with more difficult …</span>

                              <span>If the rumors are to be believed, Winter Wildcards is coming soon to EA FC 25, and Ultimate Team players can expect plenty of festivities over the next couple of weeks.


As of writing, the Globetrotters promo is life in Ultimate Team, but it&#x27;s going to be a one-week affair from the looks of it. Based on the social media rumors, the Winter Wildcards promo is going to be released this Friday. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about which players will feature in it.


EA FC 25 Winter Wildcards promo player leaks


As of writing, only one player has been leaked, but it&#x27;s safe to expect new names to appear as we get closer to the release. It will be interesting to see which footballers will be included in this promo and if it will be a two-team affair. If we get two teams, it means that the Winter Wildcards promo will last for two weeks.



Erling Haaland (expected to get two cards with two positions). 



Interestingly, there have been a couple of rumors doing the rounds as we wait for the names of the footballers to appear. A new card design called &quot;NumeroFUT&quot; has reportedly been added to the card database. The design seems completely different from anything we have received in Ultimate Team in the recent past.


Winter Wildcards is also expected to have its version of Heroes and Icons. Last year, Winter Wildcard Icons had different positions on them, which really made the promo interesting. Whether EA Sports does something similar this year remains to be seen.


EA FC 25 Winter Wildcards promo release date


The upcoming promo is expected to go live on Friday, December 20, right ahead of the Christmas season. The cards will be available at 6 p.m. UTC, which is the usual time for all promo releases. Apart from new cards in packs, promo items will be available in Objectives and SBCs, so make sure to be on the lookout for them.

Is Armour or Evasion better in Path of Exile 2?


While it would be very easy to give you a direct answer to this question, the truth is: Path of Exile 2 is a complex game, and there is no clear-cut answer thanks to the sheer volume of options available to you. There are countless scenarios where Armour is better than Evasion, and Evasion is better than Armour, so rather than directly comparing these two defensive stats, I&#x27;ll explain their use cases along with their strengths and weaknesses, for your information.

Before you dive into the new game modes, though, check out the new frame, Cyte-09, how to build him, and how his sniper rifle works. Then, it&#x27;s time to sink your teeth into the 1999 game modes.

Hell-Scrub is, essentially, a new version of Survival in Warframe. It comes in two flavors: Scaldra and Techrot. These play the same, just with enemies of each respective faction.

Warframe: 1999&#x27;s calendar and seasons explained


The calendar in Warframe: 1999 is basically a to-do list of tasks you can complete over the course of a month. Each real-time week is its own &#x27;season&#x27; that&#x27;s divided into three in-game calendar months. A real-time month, then, comes out to a year on the calendar.

                              <span>Having a powerful fishing rod is important for your in-game progression in Fisch, and using Enchant Relics will help you to empower them.


Every rod has certain attributes that determine how well it works, and some of them also have unique passive abilities that help you with certain catches. Using an Enchantment Relic will help you boost the existing stats of the rods, and you can choose them to strengthen a specific aspect of a rod you own.


How to buy Enchant Relics in Fisch


There are two main ways to get Enchant Relics - buy it or fish it out of the water. If you opt for the latter, you won&#x27;t need to spend any extra resources. However, you can&#x27;t rely on this process, as the odds of getting a Relic are low. Secondly, the one you get might not be what you&#x27;re looking for.


If you want a more foolproof procedure, you can buy Enchantment Relics from Merlin. You can find the NPC at Sunstone Island, and buying a Relic will cost 11,000C$. While this process has no reliance on luck, it can be expensive if you&#x27;re just starting to play Fisch. You&#x27;ll also have to reach level 30 before you can use this function inside the game.




To complete the Enchantment process, you&#x27;ll have to stand at the platform situated at the Keeper&#x27;s Altar when it is night. Make sure you have equipped the rod that you want to enchant. Once the process is complete, you&#x27;ll have a random enchantment on the equipped rod.


This Altar can be found at The Statue of Sovereignty, which can be accessed from both the starter island and Sunstone Island. You&#x27;ll need a boat to travel to the place, and a small amount of in-game credits is also needed to begin the Enchantment process.


If you&#x27;re a beginner, you won&#x27;t need to worry too much about getting the relics, as they&#x27;re best suited once you have a few mid and endgame rods in your inventory.

                              <span>As video games have been getting bigger and bigger, the overall cost of their development has also been increasing as well. This is something that has been affecting almost every big gaming company, and Nintendo is obviously no exception. 


In a recent Investors Q&amp;A, several key figures at the company discussed different topics regarding the current state of the gaming industry and the future of the company. The second question was all about the rising costs of game development, which Shigeru Miyamoto, one of the most important developers and designers in video game history, answered. &quot;Our research and development expenses have been increasing each year. Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable,&quot; he said.

How to open the Memorial Gate


In order to open the Memorial Gate in the Cemetery of the Eternals you need to defeat two specific bosses and obtain their key pieces. Both key pieces are required to actually open the Memorial Gate and proceed further into the cemetery.

                              <span>Developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Ciri has indeed been recast for her leading role in the upcoming The Witcher 4. 


In a message to TheGamer, the Polish company revealed that Ciara Berkeley will play Ciri. She&#x27;s taking over for Jo Wyatt, who voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3. 


&quot;Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for The Witcher IV Cinematic Reveal Trailer,&quot; a representative from CD Projekt Red told TheGamer. &quot;Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series.&quot;




Ciri gets recast for The Witcher 4, as some were assuming


Fans began speculating over the change following the release of The Witcher 4&#x27;s cinematic trailer during The Game Awards 2024 last week. Even though it&#x27;s been roughly a decade since the game, sharp-eared players pondered over Ciri&#x27;s possible voice change. I also felt she sounded a bit off, but I chalked it up to the possible span of time between each game&#x27;s story.


I can get by the change, though. The cinematic trailer showcased what looked to be a more experienced Ciri, who passed the trial to become a full-fledged witcher. She seems older, more experienced, and perhaps as fed up with the superstitious common folk as Geralt. No wonder he took up the wine-making business. Berkeley gives the Lion of Cintra a harder edge to her voice, which makes sense considering the aforementioned.


Berkeley is a fairly new actor, beginning in 2020 with three productions to her name. She&#x27;s appeared in Swing Bout (2024), The Deceived (2020), and Normal People (2020). The Witcher 4 will be her first video game role.

Overwatch 2 launched in 2022 as a successor to the genre-defining Overwatch. Rather than the standard team shooters, the hero shooter gives different player characters different powers, strengths, and weaknesses. The free-to-play title racked up 25 million players within 10 days of its la…</span>

                              <span>The Globetrotters Challenge 2 SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete a new fodder challenge to earn a free pack in Ultimate Team.


This is the second fodder challenge that has been released as part of the Globetrotters promo. As usual, the SBC can be completed using low-rated items that might already be present in your Ultimate Team inventory. That said, there are certain requirements that you&#x27;ll have to follow, and let&#x27;s take a look at how you can finish the challenge at the lowest possible cost. 


EA FC 25 Globetrotters Challenge 2 SBC tasks


The Globetrotters Challenge 2 SBC has a single task, and here are the requirements. 


Task - Globetrotters Challenge 2 SBC



Max. Nationalities in Squad: 5


Min. 3 Players from the same Club


Min. 10 Players: Rare


Min. Team Rating: 70


Min. Squad Total Chemistry Points: 31

The primary objective is to use items that are already available in your Ultimate Team inventory. That will help you to reduce the cost of completing the challenge, and increase the potential valuation of the rewards. As an alternative, you can use the following solution to solve the SBC quickly, and get all the available rewards. 


Task - Globetrotters Challenge 2 SBC



Scarlett ST 64


Morris ST 74


Grant LM 64


Richards CM 56


Rowe CM 62


Skoras RM 72


Morgan LB 74


Boyata CB 69


Brunt CB 64


Siquet RB 72


Palmer GK 72



You&#x27;ll get a Rare Gold Pack after completing the challenge. The pack includes 12 Rare Gold Player and Club items, with 3 guaranteed to Player items. Any one of those player cards will be rated 81 or higher, so there&#x27;s a chance for getting a Walkout/promo item from opening the pack. Make sure to complete the challenge before it expires from Ultimate Team.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s specialists are occasionally life-saving, giving you that little bit of extra firepower you need to turn the tides of a stalemate or catch someone persistently running away. For the most part, you and other players will outperform them, but they&#x27;re still worth having for weekly quests.

How to hire a specialist in Fortnite Chapter 6, Season 1


Hiring specialists in Fortnite involves visiting any NPC that appears with a square dialogue icon on your map. As you land or travel to a landmark, you&#x27;ll notice these appear, indicating someone is nearby to hire or purchase weapons from. 


Fortnite Chapter 6, Season 1 has four specialists in the following locations:


NPC Name
Specialist Type
Location




Cinder
Heavy Specialist
Open-Air Onsen, south of Demon&#x27;s Dojo


Vi
Scout Specialist
Rolling Blossom Farm, south of Seaport City


Mizuki
Supply Specialist
Lost Lake


Helsie
Medic Specialist
Canyon Crossing






Each specialist costs 250 gold bars to hire, making them inexpensive if you&#x27;re only hiring them once or twice for some quests. Nonetheless, if you recruit them during every round, these costs will add up, so be sure to pick up as much gold as possible from eliminations and chest loot.

How to collect ammo in Fortnite


Fortunately, collecting ammo is much easier than hiring a specialist. You can collect ammo by opening chest loot, picking it up off the ground, or eliminating other players. You can also find ammo boxes around the Fortnite map in every landmark and POI, giving you plenty of chances to stockpile some for your next fight.

                              <span>The Nahuel Molina Globetrotters SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete it to unlock a special card for your Ultimate Team squad.


Molina becomes the latest footballer to become a part of the Globetrotters promo, and he can be a great fit for beginners and veterans alike. To play with the card, you&#x27;ll need to complete all the tasks that are part of the SBC before it expires. Let&#x27;s take a look at the cheapest way to complete the full SBC. 


EA FC 25 Nahuel Molina Globetrotters SBC tasks


The Nahuel Molina Globetrotters SBC has two tasks, and here are the conditions. 


Task 1 - LaLiga



Min. 1 Players from: LALIGA EA SPORTS


Min. Team Rating: 82



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 83



EA FC 25 Nahuel Molina Globetrotters SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a set of solution you can use to complete the challenge, and unlock the new Molina card. 


Task 1 - LaLiga



Any 9 82-rated item


Any 78-rated item


Remiro 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Any 10 83-rated items


Any 81-rated TOTW item



The SBC can be completed for basic fodder, and hence, the completion cost is really low. However, you shouldn&#x27;t complete the SBC only for its low completion cost. Molina&#x27;s Globetrotters item can play as a RM as well, although his best fit is as a RB. 


His primary role is Attacking Wingback++, but he can also operate efficiently as either a Falseback or a Wingback. The Pace (90) and Defending (86), but there is a shortage in base Physicality. At the low price, however, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Additionally, there&#x27;s a high chance that he could fit in a future evolution, which will allow you to improve him further and erase the weaknesses that he has at the moment.

The two footballers are among the biggest superstars of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s football, and their base items are still used heavily by the community as of writing. Of course, both Aitana and Jude have promo cards as well, but you&#x27;ll have to be really lucky to pack them in the first place (their prices in the market are very high). 


Thankfully, EA Sports has a novel solution to all those problems, and the community is going to be the biggest benefactor. 


Update: The pack is now available if you&#x27;re eligible to receive the pack in Ultimate Team.

What is Jingle Hells mode in BO6 Zombies?


The Jingle Hells limited mode transforms Zombies&#x27; Liberty Falls into a winter wonderland. Despite the undead still roaming the map, the festive ambiance with its adorned Christmas trees, snow, and zombie costumes will surely get you in the holiday mood. However, this also presents some challenges, as the Mystery Box, Crafting Table, and Arsenal Machines are inaccessible due to the winter storm, adding an extra layer of difficulty to the Main Quest.

Jeff is one of the cutest characters to come out of Marvel Comics, and Rivals is fully aware of this.


If you&#x27;re among the folks who love Jeff and wish him happiness with everything he does, this festival gives you the chance to do so. It adds a new game mode with him as the main character and exclusive costumes to unlock. Let&#x27;s dive into the details of Marvel Rivals&#x27; Jeff&#x27;s Winter Splash Festival.


What is Marvel Rivals Jeff&#x27;s Winter Splash Festival?


Jeff&#x27;s Winter Splash Festival is a festive, limited-time game mode that plays similar to games like Splatoon. You, playing as the titular character, Jeff the Landshark, run aro…</span>

                              <span>The competition for the best PlayStation game of 2024 sure was fierce. But, at the end of the day, it had to come down to at least one winner. For Destructoid&#x27;s choice of the best PS4/PS5 game of the year, we have Astro Bot, the beloved platformer that&#x27;s become a tremendous ode for PlayStation players.


It may come as no surprise to see Astro Bot at the top of the list. I mean, it did take home the winner of the best game of the year at The Game Awards. And, as someone who&#x27;s poured a ton of hours into this platformer, I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better pick. It&#x27;s one of the first times where the game of the year is actually my personal game of the year, and it&#x27;s incredibly satisfying.




Astro Bot brought back such a simple concept to games: fun. There are so many titles out there that are all …</span>

Can you play Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo Switch?

The simple, sweet answer is yes, Ocarina of Time is available on the Nintendo Switch. You can’t buy an Ocarina of Time Switch cartridge, but you can play the game on the Switch if you’ve got a subscription to the Expansion Pack tier of Nintendo Switch Online.


This improved version of Nintendo Switch Online allows you to play Nintendo 64 games on the Switch’s virtual console. Because it&#x27;s the Nintendo 64’s most highly rated game, the Expansion Pack…</span>

Well, there are a lot of difficult fish to try and catch in this classic Roblox game, but what would be the rarest? In this article we&#x27;ll look at the ten rarest fish in Fisch ranked, both in the Mythic and Legendary rarity brackets. How many of these can you catch?


The rarest fish in Fisch by ranking


1. Emperor Jellyfish (Mythic)


The stuff of dreams for many Fisch players, this huge Jellyfish can only be found at the Desolate Deep. Do not be mistaken, as they will put up a fight and even use stalactites to defend themselves. Not only that, but they will also inflict a hefty 75% speed decrease while moving around quite fast themselves. You can find them in rainy weather, and you should use a magnet as bait. They&#x27;re also worth 450…</span>

More than 21 years later, we&#x27;ve seen a franchise that had its ups and downs but always seems to find a new gear and improve upon old formulas. At this point, we don&#x27;t know exactly what we&#x27;ll be getting in Doom: The Dark Ages, but we&#x27;ll sure be there to find out.

                              <span>Judero developer Talha and Jack Co. has announced its next game with a brief teaser trailer. Mashina will continue the crafted stop-motion aesthetic, adopting a more sci-fi theme. A Kickstarter to fund it will launch sometime in January.


If you’re not familiar, Judero is a bizarre stop-motion game maybe about Scotland, but also not entirely? You play as a dude trying to climb the glass mountain because the game world compels him to do so. It’s hard to describe. I don’t fully get it myself, but the vibes are immaculate. I’ve got a full review of it over here if you’re interested.




Information on Mashina is pretty sparse. It seems to be named after how people commonly mispronounce “Machina” (it’s mahk-ee-na rather than mash-ee-na), and it seems to star a rotund little robot. The teaser trailer provides us with shockingly little information. The Kickstarter and YouTube description simply say, “A little robot digs to repair her world. Dig, build, discover and mend in a chill, stop-motion world.” That’s all the information in its entirety.


I’m sure more details will be given out when the Kickstarter launches. Judero’s Kickstarter had plenty of information, and, looking back, had a lot of stuff already complete and ready to go. But I think you already have an idea of what you’d be getting from Talha and Jack Co. I wouldn’t need to see a design document, just completely unmoored creativity.


Mashina doesn’t currently have an announced release date. The Kickstarter for funding it is launching sometime in January.

News about the Nvidia App&#x27;s performance problems broke thanks to Tom&#x27;s Hardware. There, Jarred Walton discussed a curious set of findings that suggested that having the App installed and using some of its features could incur a frankly massive 15% performance loss in video games. &quot;Thankfully, the performance decrease isn&#x27;t universally 15%, but we tested with the 4060 and saw a 2–12 percent drop in framerates across the five games that we tested,&quot; says the article.

What do you need to reset skill points


Screenshot by Destructoid


You need an item called Crystal of Rebirth. You can buy this item (crystal) from Shodo. Shodo is one of the three vendors in the starting area, and there is a feather above their head. 


You can buy the Crystal of Rebirth for 1,010 gems.


How to reset skill points

Once you buy Crystal of Rebirth, open your backpack. Navigate to Misc / Crystals, and you should see the item in your backpack. Select it and click on USE. Needless to say, this will consume the item.

                              <span>Over the past few generations, Nvidia has consistently launched a new generation of GPUs every two years, with the 4000 series arriving in October 2022. Well, we&#x27;re due for the RTX 5000 series and while the tech giant is keeping things under wraps for now, it looks like the lid was well and truly popped off recently.


As spotted in a report from Videocardz, Hong Kong-based manufacturer ZOTAC seemed to have accidentally listed an Nvidia RTX 5090 in a drop-down menu on its website. Not only that, screenshots also show a 5080, 5070 Ti, 5070, and even the Chinese-specific 5090D.

Suffice it to say, it looks as though ZOTAC has been quick to remove these, so you won&#x27;t find them on the website now. However, it does all but confirm that the RTX 5000 series is imminent, as well as giving us a quick glimpse into some of the next generation&#x27;s details.


A blunder or a publicity stunt?


As well as showing us a list of what could well be an initial line-up of Nvidia&#x27;s next-gen GPUs, the report from Videocardz also shows a couple of screenshots that suggest the 5000 series will have upwards of 32GB of RAM and will run on GDDR7 memory. 


Given that the RTX 4090 – currently the world&#x27;s most powerful graphics card – uses GDDR6X and has 24GB of RAM, we can ascertain that Nvidia will be upping the ante for the 5000 series. Of course, this would make sense for new-gen hardware, so it&#x27;s probably not too surprising.


However, we don&#x27;t appear to have gotten any confirmation about any of this at the time of writing. Nvidia will be attending CES 2025 between January 6 and January 10, so the company will almost certainly be giving us more on the upcoming GPUs during this time. Until then, Jensen Huang and his team may have to do a little bit of damage limitation as these screenshots circulate further.

If you follow the marker, you&#x27;ll end up at the door to the Whispering Webs (the first dungeon), and there&#x27;s a good chance you won&#x27;t know what to do next.


We&#x27;ve been in this situation, and that&#x27;s why we made this guide.


How to enter Whispering Webs

You need a key, the Mysterious Key, to be more specific. For some reason, the game will tell you &quot;Oops... it seems like something is missing...&quot; which, OBVIOUSLY (not) means, you need a key for the dungeon door that clearly doesn&#x27;t even have a keyhole.


So, where do you get the key? From the Giant Spider boss, nearby, which you fought a few times for your previous quests. So, how co…</span>

The Intel Arc B580 graphics showed some nice generational uplift under Linux for most workloads but there were some anomalies where clearly the Intel Linux graphics driver had room to better optimize the new Xe2/Battlemage graphics support. Windows benchmarks of the Intel Arc B580 also showed it performing more competitively to the likes of the GeForce RTX 4060 compared to what I was seeing under Linux. Thus I spent the past few days working on some Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux graphics benchmarks for both Intel Arc Graphics of Alchemist and Battlemage GPUs to see how the performance compares.</span>

Publisher Bandai Namco has released the opening cinematic for the upcoming Freedom Wars Remastered on Switch.
Launching on 10th January 2025, the game is a revamped version of the 2014 original on the PS Vita. In what is either a remarkable coincidence or a calculated effort, the reveal of the opening movie also comes exactly 13 years after the Japanese launch of the PS Vita on 17th December 2011. Bravo!

Kato founded the company back in 1981 and, as highlighted by our friends over at Time Extension, chose the name &#x27;Falcom&#x27; as a play on the Millenium Falcon from Star Wars, ultimately adding in &#x27;Nihon&#x27; as he felt the single word title wasn&#x27;t quite enough on its own.

We had a great time with the Lucasarts-inspired point-and-click adventure Loco Motive when it arrived at Switch station last month, but there was no denying that the whodunnit suffered from a fair number of pesky bugs. Fortunately, said bugs have been the target of Robust Games&#x27; latest update.
The Loco Motive ver. 1.0.4 patch arrived on Steam earlier this month, and the dev took to BlueSky today to announce that it has finally made its way over to Switch. The update is all about those aforementioned technical issues, with Robust Games making a good number of changes across the game&#x27;s stability, dialogue, visuals, gameplay and more.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a Wanda-ful Life.
The free-to-play hero shooter Marvel Rivals has made quite a splash since it landed on PS5, Xbox Series and PC earlier this month — like, a 10 million players in its first three days-sized splash — and now, as the live-service title gears up for its first festive period, an upcoming new game mode has our Nintendo radars a-beeping.
You see, as noted by our friends over at Push Square, the soon-to-be-added &#x27;Jeff&#x27;s Winter Splash Festival&#x27; (arriving on 20th December) bears a striking resemblance to Nintendo&#x27;s squid-based shooter, Splatoon. This game mode swaps out the usual PvP shooting and healing for a Turf War colour-spreading objective, where opposing teams will use the adorable Strategist&#x27;s spray abilities to paint the surrounding area.

We are speeding ever closer to the worldwide release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in cinemas from 20th December, so, naturally, spoilers are already popping up online. Tut.
Select pre-screenings of the movie have taken place in recent weeks, and it appears that some naughty customers whipped their phones out during the post-credits scene to grab some footage of the final sequence. Of course, we&#x27;re not going to be linking the video here, but the post has already spread its roots online.

Game developer Hideki Kamiya is well known for his remarkable contributions to the industry and has personally overseen some of the most critically-acclaimed titles of all time, including the likes of Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Bayonetta, and of course, Ōkami.
He&#x27;s also pretty notorious, however, for his harsh remarks on social media, often directed at fans who respond to his posts in English. Indeed, although most people have often approached the creator in good faith (and yes, a few like to just provoke him for the fun of it), many have wound up being outright blocked as a result of simply asking a harmless question.

If you love cats (and there are plenty of us here at Nintendo Life who do), then you might be interested in checking out this upcoming open-world title known as Catly.
There&#x27;s no release date just yet, but during The Game Awards this year it was confirmed for the Nintendo Switch and multiple other platforms. It will apparently feature some MMO aspects, according to its Steam listing.

The order was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by Netflix, Bell, and several major Hollywood studios alleging copyright infringement.  The operators of the associated Soap2Day domains must pay millions of Canadian dollars in damages.

Spain&#x27;s LaLiga is already mailing out &#x27;fines&#x27;, ostensibly to people who simply watched pirate streams. Predictably, there&#x27;s more to it than that.

Battlemage v testu doprovodily starší modely předchozí generace Alchemist. Výsledky jsou k dispozici v testu, obecně lze konstatovat, že jsou značně nevyrovnané. Jednou je karta viditelně rychlejší pod Windows, jindy zase na Linuxu a někdy jsou výsledky víceméně vyrovnané.</span>

                              <span>Toy Box sounds like a very Xmassy game, but then you watch a trailer, and realise that it is not very Xmassy at all. It&#x27;s a free visual novel with a macabre puzzling element. The setup is that you&#x27;re a toy inspector working for a jovial Grand Toy Maker, his face hidden above the top of the screen. Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either &quot;salvage&quot; them or &quot;sentence&quot; them to the incinerator.

                              <span>Great was the adulation last week when FromSoftware announced a new Elden Ring game, Elden Ring: Nightreign - and great the lamentation from certain quarters when it was revealed to be a co-op-focussed experience. If you missed the reveal, perhaps because you value sleep over the spectacle of Geoff Keighley&#x27;s fashion friends, let me catch you up: in Nightreign, you pick one of eight preset characters and explore a parallel-universe version of Elden Ring&#x27;s Limgrave map, fighting lesser foes and levelling up quickly so that you can battle a boss at the end of each 15-minute in-game day.

Oh, you&#x27;re sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You&#x27;re playing a card game with a dude called &quot;Aldert&quot;. The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you&#x27;re just sitting there. Playing another &quot;cow&quot; card. Okay.
Guess you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that the Witcher 4 developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the recently trailered Ciri-led sequel.

Před tím totiž bylo zvykem měnit vedoucího projektu po zhruba dvou letech. Matthew doufá, že se podaří jeho nástupce najít na začátku roku 2025. On sám se přesouvá do manažerské role v Community Linux Engineering v Red Hatu a bude novému FPL nablízku.</span>

The same applies to BitcoinTorrentz, which once charged today&#x27;s equivalent of $8,000 per gigabyte transferred.

Earlier this month, operators of pirate anime sites in Brazil received in-person visits from CODA, acting on behalf of three major Japanese anime producers. CODA reports that Bakashi.tv, the third most-visited anime site in Brazil, shut down among 15 in total. No other sites are officially named, but our unofficial list provides a few pointers.

And yes, we said &quot;thousands&quot;. Indeed, there are so many games currently seeing a price cut on the eShop that it can be difficult to know where to start, but that&#x27;s where we come in. Below, we&#x27;ve laid out every game in the Nintendo Holiday Sale that we&#x27;ve awarded 9/10 or higher, so you can filter through to the cream of the crop in no time.

                              <span>You been living under a Sarlacc Pit?
Chances are you&#x27;re probably reasonably familiar with Capcom&#x27;s acclaimed action role-playing franchise Monster Hunter, even if you don&#x27;t necessarily play it. If, however, you&#x27;re completely new to the whole thing and would perhaps benefit from a bit of an introduction, then a new overview video presented by none other than Daisy Ridley (Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, Chaos Walking, Magpie) should give you exactly what you need.
Clocking in at just over 10 minutes in length, the video is clearly designed to bring newcomers into the world of Monster Hunter ahead of the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds on 28th February 2025, a game that sadly won&#x27;t be gracing the Switch.

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s been over two weeks&quot;.
We&#x27;ve talked about copycats and scam games on the eShop many times — with a multitude of games using keywords and AI-generated screenshots and key art flooding the eShop, it&#x27;s a huge problem for devs.
And now, the creative director of indie hit Unpacking has called Nintendo out on the lack of response to these games (via Eurogamer). Specifically, this follows on from a number of games and DLC sharing the same name as Witch Beam&#x27;s beautiful puzzle game appearing on the eShop in late November.

After just scraping through a successful Kickstarter campaign, developer GameAtomic now has the Nintendo Switch in its sights for its upcoming pixel art metroidvania sequel, Kraino ReBirth.
We reviewed Kraino Origins for the Switch and awarded it a coveted score of 9/10, noting the game&#x27;s excellent level design and appealing visuals. If you thought that one looked good, though, then you&#x27;re in for a treat with ReBirth, as the pixel art design has been given a significant overhaul to really highlight the gorgeous gothic environments and enemies.

Off the back of its launch in October, Square Enix has today released an all-new update for Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, bringing the remake up to ver. 1.0.2.
A decent helping of new additions makes its way into the game this time around, including the ability to restart battles, quickly navigate menus via a shortcut button, display formations and adjust camera speed. There&#x27;s also a good amount of bug-squashing, so the whole experience should play that bit better.

Following on from accessory makers such as iVolver and Dbrand putting out images and dimensions of the Switch 2, NextHandheld on Reddit claims to have seen and handled (though not played) the final retail hardware and has been fielding questions from curious fans.

As spotted on the r/GamingLeaksAndRumours Reddit forum by user Joseki100 (off the back of an initial post by PlatinumGamesFanboy), four key players in PlatinumGames development have recently updated their social media bios to remove all mention of the company.

In the UK this week, familiar faces make up the majority of the top ten boxed charts as customers look to get their preparations in order for Christmas Day. As such, we&#x27;ve got EA Sports FC 25, Hogwarts Legacy, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 all standing proud atop the podium with no alterations to their positions from last week.
In fact, other than newcomer Black Myth: Wukong and Black Ops 6, the rest of the top ten are all games that can be played on Switch, with Super Mario Party Jamboree and Nintendo Switch Sports swapping positions, and Sonic X Shadow Generations falling down two spots to land at number nine.

                              <span>At 9 years old, in the plastic seats of a Sega Rally arcade machine, I quickly learned that &quot;automatic&quot; is better than &quot;manual&quot; without understanding why. And now I know: changing gears is a fucking chore. This year, in my mid-thirties, I finally learned to drive. And weirdly, a racing game about destroying clapped-out old bangers helped me along.

If you don&#x27;t have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I&#x27;ve had a word with Santa&#x27;s elves, and they say it&#x27;s permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll feed him to the Maw.

                              <span>Minulý týždeň Meta vydala novú verziu svojho vlajkového jazykového modelu Llama 3.3. Nová Llama 3.3 70B ponúka výkon porovnateľný s väčším modelom Llama 3.1 405B. Nový model je výrazne menší, rýchlejší a lacnejší. Model je optimalizovaný pre nákladovú efektívnosť, čo ho robí prístupnejším pre vývojárov a výskumníkov. Ak máme veriť oficiálnym údajom, Llama 3.3 70B model je 25-krát lacnejší ako jeho konkurent GPT-4o mini. Llama 3.3 v súčasnosti podporuje len textový mód. Jazykový model Llama 3.3 70B je možné si vyskúšať na high-endových notebookoch a desktopoch.</span>

Well, sort of - Crimson Desert is out sometime in late 2025.

Employees at Zenimax Online Studios launched their union with 461 members, as announced on social media site Bluesky last night.

The big new angle is that it&#x27;ll be a third-person shooter and you can play in online co-op as a team of T-rex wreckers. You then slurp up their dino DNA to upgrade your character. Come and watch these crimes against nature in the trailer below.

                              <span>Earlier this week we heard rumblings of a new character announcement for Tekken 8, and at the same time a trailer dropped a big unmistakable hint for red-dressed rabble rouser Anna Williams. Turns out that unmistakable hint was mistakable. My mistake. At last night&#x27;s Game Awards we learned that the next fighter to come to the game will be... Clive? From Final Fantasy XVI? Sure. Why not.

Dispatch is a story-focused strategy game where you’ll play a broke superhero trying to get himself a new mech suit by working at a hero dispatch center. Having trouble tracking a trailer down for this one, but you can find it here on Steam.
Wait. I’ve found it! Leaving that last bit in though. Consider it my gift to you reader. The gift of visible workflow at 4am.

                              <span>Back in the mid &#x27;90s, I was hooked on an PC racing game called Screamer. It got a sequel a couple of years later, and then the series went dormant. Until now, when it&#x27;s seemingly returning as a foreboding, anime-infused racer about defying death, once again called simply Screamer. Huh! Huh. You&#x27;ll find a trailer below.

It&#x27;s called Onimusha Way Of The Sword, and is the first new entry in Capcom&#x27;s samurai action-horror series since... well, that upcoming VR game doesn&#x27;t count, and nor does the Warlords remaster in 2018. So, 2012? Maybe 2006, if you rule out the Unity browser sim? Cor.

                              <span>Arrowhead and Sony have released a new Helldivers 2 update that introduces the long-rumoured third faction, the Illuminate. Titled Omens of Tyranny, the update also stirs in city maps and a driveable jeep with a mounted gun that immediately reminds me of Halo&#x27;s Warthog, and is hopefully just as fragile and bouncy. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

Thankfully this year he also had a game to show: Split Fiction, a new co-op action adventure.

Now we have both, plus some punching. Here’s that trailer.

It’s just been announced at Wrasslin&#x27; Geoff’s Winter Hootenanny, aka the Game Awards, and there’s a 10 day PC playtest underway right now. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched on console back in February, and if I&#x27;d had to guess, I&#x27;d say it would arrive on PC about a year later. Hey - guess what! Square Enix just gave Rebirth a PC release date: January 23rd, 2025.

                              <span>CD Projekt have screened the first trailer for The Witcher 4, the next instalment in their fantasy monster-slaying series. It’s another single player open world RPG, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Ciri is the protagonist. In fact, she&#x27;s the protagonist for a whole new Witcher saga, though there’s a tease at the end of the footage that crusty old Geralt may return as well.

Like its predecessor, this one’s a party-based CRPG with tactical combat, featuring single player and online co-op. Here’s a trailer. Warning: it has shiny rock people in it, the worst videogame enemy.

                              <span>Sifu and Absolver developers Sloclap have announced Rematch, a 5v5 multiplayer football game with a gentle dusting of science fiction, out in summer 2025. If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers&#x27; previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It&#x27;s like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.
I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it&#x27;s due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It&#x27;s also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it&#x27;s a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.

                              <span>A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.
Until, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”
Back in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”

We get to see wise guys swinging knives, riding horses and glowering silently at sun-baked Sicilian countryside.

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s &quot;embarrassing&quot; shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.
Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen.

                              <span>At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it&#x27;s a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.
The more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it&#x27;s specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman&#x27;s back. I understand why it&#x27;s supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don&#x27;t.

                              <span>After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.
Also, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.

                              <span>In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.
When Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That&#x27;s a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.
Aldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (&quot;The goal is to do everything, right?&quot;). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it&#x27;s ever been.

                              <span>If Space Marine 2&#x27;s wanton devil-mulching left you hungry for more fantastical depictions of medieval zealotry, maybe take a look at Band Of Crusaders, an open-world party-based RPG in which you are the Grandmaster of a knightly order, trying to keep a bunch of wily Archdemons out of Europe. It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends &quot;inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore&quot;. Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

                              <span>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve&#x27;s new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it&#x27;s only going to be an option - not the new default.

                              <span>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don&#x27;t even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can&#x27;t be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it&#x27;s your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.

Friends, it&#x27;s time to play Skeal.

                              <span>Infamous evolutionary flop Spore, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.

Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It&#x27;s a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There&#x27;s an explanatory video below.

The differences are myriad, given that Breaker is also 3D, open world, co-op and a roguelite. It also now has a release date for its launch into Steam Early Access: January 14th, 2025.

It&#x27;s about steering a tank through a desolate sci-fi landscape, blasting similar tank and mecha enemies to bits, then scavenging them for parts using a drone.

It&#x27;s been in quiet development for years, but it got a big reveal during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream. It was also released during tonight&#x27;s Day Of The Devs stream, so you can buy it from the Epic Games Store now.

Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the best beginner POE2 class - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.

Sampling the demo, I was immediately enflamed by the orchestral score and placed in a mood of white-gloved sophistication only slightly spoiled by the familiarity of the underlying platform moveset, and by my repeatedly falling into pits.

                              <span>First covered by Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2017, Short Trip was a chill hand-drawn game about driving a tram through a mountain populated by cats. Back then, it was only available as a free-to-play browser or itch.io experience. Seven years later, though, and on this very day, it&#x27;s out on Steam. Not only that, it&#x27;s arriving with all the tramming of the original, with an added &quot;scheduled mode&quot; that adds more charm to an already lovely game.

                              <span>Ever wondered what the intro cutscene to Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver would sound like voiced by Solid Snake actor David Hayter? Quite specific of you, but a new documentary from Noclip might just have what you’re looking for. The Past, Present &amp; Future of Soul Reaver interviews key developers from the action adventure game, and about halfway through host Danny O’ Dwyer gets hold of some archive materials, including old audition tapes. These include Mark Hamill reading for Janos Audren, and Jennifer Hale for Ariel.
The biggest treat, of course, is hearing Hayter read for Raziel, especially as it’s that excellent opening monologue. You’ll find the video below, with Hayter around 37:30.

                              <span>The Steam Deck OLED has joined Valve’s Certified Refurbished programme, offering a much cheaper way of getting your hands on the best handheld PC around. Provided you don’t mind it being in someone else’s first, anyway. As with official refurbs of the original Steam Deck, &quot;certified&quot; Steam Deck OLEDs are formerly-broken models that have been returned to Valve, fixed up and tested in-house, then put back on the market at steep discounts. You’re looking at £389/$439 for the 512GB spec and £459/$519 for 1TB, down from £479/$549 and £569/$649 respectively.

                              <span>I am a Winter baby. My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.

                              <span>While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say &quot;his own choomba shot him!&quot; for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it&#x27;s ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.

On Monday night, yet another CDN IP address was added to the blocklist rendering innocent sites unavailable. Italian tech news site DDaY, a long-standing critic of Piracy Shield&#x27;s indiscriminate blocking, was among those affected.

                              <span>Ooh, this feels like the biggest news out of this evening&#x27;s Wholesome Snack showcase: nourishing photography adventure Toem is getting a sequel, appropriately called Toem 2. It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

                              <span>Pity the &quot;relaxing&quot; games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. 

Yet here&#x27;s the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn&#x27;t make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.

Whichever it is, Little Rocket Lab is a factory-builder about efficiently placing conveyors and robot arms, and is drawn in the warm, pixel art small-town of a Stardew-like. That sounds like a fitting combination, although it does mean you&#x27;re building a NASA-sized rocketship on the outskirts of your quaint hometown. That can&#x27;t be good for noise pollution. There&#x27;s an announcement trailer below.

The results were seemingly delightful, and here comes a sequel.

Duck Detective: The Ghost Of Glamping will offer a further 2-3 hours of mystery-solving and is aiming for release in 2025.

                              <span>Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It&#x27;s currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it&#x27;s free-to-play with the usual comet&#x27;s tail of microtransactables 2) it&#x27;s third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I&#x27;m not going to share pictures. You&#x27;ll have to google that filth yourself.


But perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You&#x27;re more interested in hearing how they&#x27;re patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here&#x27;s what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.

                              <span>I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it&#x27;s an appalling bait-and-switch. It&#x27;s like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It&#x27;s like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don&#x27;t want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. 


Being a &quot;true&quot; 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it&#x27;s nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they&#x27;re threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>London Gatwick Airport is a rare shade of brown, known to neither science nor art. A brown that doesn’t appear on the light spectrum. No easel contains it. It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.

                              <span>Among my last-resort tactics for generating precious PC gaming news is to go on holiday - for as sure as toast lands buttered side down while cats always land on their feet, as sure as the number 13 breeds calamity and Star Citizen committing to a release date guarantees a delay, myself going on holiday will always, somehow, conjure a big story from the crevices. It&#x27;s basic physics. In this case, I was on holiday from Friday through Monday, and this fact and this fact alone appears to have coaxed some toy manufacturer into taking the internet&#x27;s most cherished indie gaming platform offline by means of a &quot;bogus&quot; phishing report, sent by &quot;AI-powered&quot; brand protection software.
The situation has now been resolved, thankfully, and you can access Itch.io as normal, but I will never pass up the opportunity to cast shade on Funko Pop, whose NFT-garlanded bobbleheads I hate as I do veruccas and forest fires. So here&#x27;s a quick recap if you, too, missed the drama.

                              <span>Goblin-hitting bonanza Path Of Exile 2 launched into early access last weekend and the devs Grinding Gear Games have dropped some big patch notes that outline some things they&#x27;ve updated already, or things they plan on updating in a future patch. Things like dodge-rolling, checkpoints, items, currencies, and other stuff I can&#x27;t list here because the intro to this article would expand and pop into a flurry of common rarity boots and bones, maybe with the odd purple rarity sword mixed in.

It mushrooms in our peripheral vision and drifts towards us as we batter out advent calendar posts, hoping we can finish writing and beat a tactical withdrawal to the kitchen before the accusatory phantom overwhelms us. It’s a game about sin and projectile patterns and llamas. It’s...

                              <span>I’ve got a strange relationship with the stealth sandbox murderbox that is Hitman: World of Assassination. If you were to ask me to list my favourite games, the latest Hitman trilogy would be in the top five, no question. And yet, I must have gotten intimidated at some point with the amount of new updates and all the spiffy unlockable suits I was missing out on, and just haven’t touched it in a couple of years now. Is the appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the game’s newest elusive target enough to reel me back in? I&#x27;m not sure, but I will say that I doubt Sean Bean can stretch his legs like that, even with the legendary flexibility offered by O2&#x27;s famously variable plans. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of Cyberpunk 2077’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.
I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.

                              <span>I’m quite smitten by the Nintendo DS stylings and traditional roguelike charms of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island, but I’m having real trouble summoning up the motivation to repeatedly grind through its opening levels to get to the interesting stuff. Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.

                              <span>Fancy taking the piss out of video games? Here you go, a fun little tool you can run in your browser easily lets you rewrite famous game quotes. The Death Generator offers a gallery full of (mostly) retro games and a simple text box that will replicate the exact font used by those games, all so you can make the little shopkeeper in Zelda say rude words, or entirely rewrite the pre-mission dossiers of Goldeneye 007. There&#x27;s a lot more than that though. I&#x27;ve done a bunch, come see what I mean and have a go yourself.

                              <span>The big question a Tekken player always wants to know is: which DLC character is coming next? Well, you&#x27;ll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley&#x27;s winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they&#x27;ve just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not just because he&#x27;s a Nazi. It&#x27;s because he&#x27;s a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there&#x27;s something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you&#x27;ve probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.
Warning: Here be spoilers.

                              <span>The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. &quot;It’s fine&quot;, I decided. &quot;It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of&quot;. Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. &quot;If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.&quot;
So starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.

                              <span>“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.
(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)

It&#x27;s almost time to give 2024 the finger, swallow a flagon of mince pie formula and tapdance backwards into the holiday, but the Maw still needs a little feeding and it has no appetite for mince pies. Nor will it eat tinsel, candy canes, mistletoe, snowmen or reindeer, though goodness knows we&#x27;ve tried. So much screaming. No, the Maw&#x27;s penchant remains for new PC game releases, and thankfully, they are as thick on the ground as reindeer pelts.

Everyone knows about ‘hardback’ and ‘softback’ books, but have you heard of the quickly discontinued ‘rice puddingback’?

                              <span>There&#x27;s no perfect time to release a video game, but if I were deciding when to release one, do you know when I&#x27;d do it? Alongside the largest blockbusters of the year, at a time when everyone is broke from buying presents, and on the same day as a huge awards show is distracting the industry&#x27;s media. 

Ballionaire apparently shares my thinking. The pachinko-inspired roguelike is launching on December 10th.

                              <span>Greece is buzzing with news of a historic, landmark decision by a local court, to imprison a person for five months for subscribing to a pirate IPTV service. The news warrants an informed conversation about creators&#x27; rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped &quot;propaganda&quot; and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

                              <span>I had a few merry evenings playing Escape Simulator back in 2022. Of the co-op escape room games I&#x27;ve played, it was the best, both in terms of its relatively neutral framing (with little heavyhanded storytelling) and its pretty solid puzzle design. The game was expanded in the time since with a versus mode and several crossover DLC, and now there comes a sequel.

Escape Simulator 2 will explore &quot;darker escape room themes&quot;, looks visually more detailed, and comes with a new editor for those who wish to design their own escape rooms.

                              <span>Morning, all. Hope you&#x27;re keeping those game-playing hands nice and toasty this winter. You can do it however you like. Wear gloves, huff on them, sit on them, give a fluffy cat a good squeeze. I personally like to clasp a mug of almost-too-hot coffee while I gaze at my Steam library wondering where the hours have gone. To each their own. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend!

I&#x27;m looking at attempting the surging sparks collection, are there some cards that aren&#x27;t available in booster packs?

So far I can see magnatron in an elite trainer starter box.

                              <span>The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.
The set contains &quot;over 400 cards and a playmat&quot; for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:

                              <span>Where were you during the Summer of Doronko Wanko? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.
It stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.

                              <span>Every fascist in this game has a cold. The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games&#x27; clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it&#x27;s a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch &#x27;em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they&#x27;re both still Indiana Jones.

                              <span>When last we left myself, on a mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 by weaponising its monsters instead of shooting its guns, my one-with-nature experiment was yielding mixed results. At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.
Now, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.

                              <span>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.
Total Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.

Taiwan&#x27;s Criminal Police Bureau recently busted three individuals promoting unlock instructions for these apps to roughly 400,000 users.  Surprisingly, this tech-savvy scheme was orchestrated by a group whose combined age totals 215 years.

While these conversions don&#x27;t knowingly violate any law, Spanish music industry group Promusicae reportedly labeled the service an audio download tool. In response, Google removed the URL from its search engine and banned the associated AdSense account.  However, after the MP3 site involved its lawyer, Google reversed its decision.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!
