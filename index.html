                              <span>Internet provider WOW has asked a Colorado federal court to dismiss an expanded piracy liability complaint filed by several film companies earlier this year. The ISP says there is no evidence to show that it received any piracy notices for the 300 new works added to the lawsuit. In addition, it believes that recent court verdicts support a dismissal of at least some of the claims in the multimillion dollar lawsuit.

Jesse Martin, former senior attorney at The Software Alliance (BSA), joins the MPA with a brief to combat and disrupt pirates&#x27; use of intermediaries. The MPA speaks of &quot;intermediary outreach&quot; and &quot;voluntary initiatives&quot; but if cooperation isn&#x27;t forthcoming, preparations will have been made.

For a level 90 Baizhu, you‚Äôll need 46 Evergloom Rings. You should expect to fight the Iniquitous Baptist an average of 18 times, or spend about 720 Resin at World Level‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>While the increasingly bizarre operator skins in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 have been divisive, I&#x27;ve been a fan of them. It makes matches more fun when my nemesis is Snoop Dogg or Discount Bobby Flay, but none of that matters now. Gundam is coming to Modern Warfare 3, and Raven Software has direct access to my wallet.


I fully support Gundam cosplay in Modern Warfare 3


Announced today on the Call of Duty blog, three tracer packs are coming alongside a Gundam-themed event in Season 4. The packs include operator skins for OGs RX-78-2 and the Zaku II alongside a more recent Gundam, the Aerial. 


There&#x27;s not much information outside of that, but I&#x27;m desperately hoping the exclusive mode pits the Principality of Zeon against the Earth Federation via the RX-78-2 and Zaku II operator skins. I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing Suletta going up against her own ghosts, but there (sadly) isn&#x27;t any word on a Gundam Calibarn operator skin.

Sledgehammer Games has consistently delivered a healthy dose of content for each seasonal update. After launching with 20 6v6 maps in November 2023, that count is now up to 33, with three more coming throughout Season 4. On top of that, a consistent offering of new game modes, events, and features makes it a great time to be a multiplayer fan. Season 4 is no different, as the devs offer up a package that will give players plenty to sink their teeth into.

Warlocks are one of the most customizable Dungeons &amp; Dragons classes, with a patron at level 1 and the actual subclass (the all-important Pact) at level 3. While patron choice has a huge impact on the flavor of your warlock, the mechanical meat of this layered and rewarding class lies in your choice of Pact.


I&#x27;ve been using this Pact of the Chain build in my own game, and I can thoroughly recommend it! The Pacts all have their own playstyles to recommend them, and the Pact of the Chain might seem underwhelming at first glance, as wizards already get the find familiar spell. However, the warlock familiar is an entirely different animal. Quite literally.


The Pact of the Chain allows the warlock to cast the find familiar spell as any run-of-the-mill wizard can, but ‚Ä¶</span>

That said, there are some things you can do to make life easier for yourself and this far past the Heavensward expansion, during which these relics became available, some of the steps can pretty much be steamrollered relatively quickly.¬†

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima is a great game in its own right. It&#x27;s got some beautiful visuals to appreciate, its combat is difficult but satisfying, and it&#x27;s got a great story about reclaiming your home from invaders. 


This sounds exciting, but numerous technical problems can hold you back from your enjoyment. Here&#x27;s how to fix the &quot;Failed to Initialize PlayStation PC SDK&quot; error in Ghost of Tsushima.


Ghost of Tsushima Failed to Initialize PlayStation PC SDK error solution


The most common solution for this issue involves the game&#x27;s files. To access them, you can do the following based on your storefront:



Steam

Head to the game in your Steam Library.


Right-click Ghost of Tsushima and select Properties.


Click Installed Files.


Click Browse.




Epic Games Store

Go to the game in your Epic Library.


Right-click it and select Manage.


Next to Installation, click the small folder icon.

Once in the game files, locate and run the file PsPcSdkRuntimeInstaller.msi. Once done, head to the drive you have Ghost of Tsushima installed on (most commonly the C drive), head to Program Data, followed by Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc, PSPC_SDK, S22, and finally 2.13.00.01. From there, run the program PsPcSdkAppMgr.exe. Once both these programs are run, Ghost of Tsushima should work.


In the event the above doesn&#x27;t work, there are a few other tricks you can try. Some people have suggested that deleting the Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. folder entirely fixed the issue for them. You could also try uninstalling and reinstalling Ghost of Tsushima, though given the download size, this should be considered a last resort.

Ahead of the upcoming Season 4 update on May 29, fear started seeping in for a segment of the Warzone player base that Ranked Play would not be added to Urzikstan. Those worries turned out to be justified, as the devs ignored traditional battle royale and brought Ranked Resurgence back for a third straight season. 


Urzikstan fans will understandably be disappointed by this revelation, but Raven Software made up for that by spicing up the experience with changes to bunkers and the gulag. Additionally, the devs made an unlimited-tac sprint perk permanent after players pleaded for the change and added the Speci‚Ä¶</span>

While they can get wacky sometimes, it is still fun to grind away and get Mastery bit by bit. One such weapon can be a little annoying to obtain but does have a unique quirk in where its parts drop. Here&#x27;s how to get the Stropha in Warframe.


Where to get the Stropha&#x27;s blueprint and parts in Warframe


The Stropha&#x27;s main blueprint is acquired as a possible drop from the Jackal at 15%. You can fight the boss on the node Fossa, Venus. On average, you should get the Stropha blueprint in about six attempts. As for the parts, these can all be acquired from differing levels of the Granum Void. Those parts, and the diffic‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Gaming is no stranger to bizarre food and drink promotions. In an effort to capitalize on its continued popularity, Stellar Blade has teamed up with Gami Chicken &amp; Beer and is offering the &quot;Stellar Blade burger&quot; at the latter&#x27;s Sydney and Melbourne, AU locations.


It comes from the Land Down Under


The partnership was officially announced by the PlayStation AU account on X. Upon checking Gami Chicken &amp; Beer&#x27;s website, it appears this is part of a larger promotion between the restaurant and Sony where patrons can enter a contest to win prize bundles.


By visiting a participating location and purchasing the Stellar Blade burger, patrons can use the receipt code to explain why they want to win the PlayStation 5 prize pack. Five winners of the grand prize will win a PlayStation 5, a Cobalt Blue controller, and a voucher for a digital copy of Stellar Blade. Additionally, there are 50 runner-up prizes for the aforementioned voucher.




As for what&#x27;s actually on the chicken sandwich, it&#x27;s described as a &quot;golden crispy chicken fillet, topped with coleslaw and rich Gami cheese sauce on a slightly toasted blue bun.&quot; It retails for $13.20 AUD ($8.81 USD) and is available for a limited time, which I would imagine ends at the same time as the promotion, on June 16, 2024.


I&#x27;m curious about the taste as I&#x27;m not opposed to a good chicken sandwich. However, I am a bit more curious as to what effect the bun dye has once it&#x27;s passed through the human digestive system. Will it be negligible or will it rival the Halloween Whopper and its Incredible Hulk poo? Time, and the Internet, will tell.

One of these mounts is the Centurio Tiger, which according to FFXIV Collect, is only owned by a miniscule 0.5% of players. So how do you get it?


Well, not easily.¬†


The Centurio Tiger is the reward for getting an achievement called ‚ÄúYou Got Game‚Äù. It‚Äôs a hunt achievement, which is always pretty difficult to achieve, but this one is special. To get ‚ÄúYou Got Game‚Äù, you‚Äôll need to complete two other staggeringly difficult achievements:



Bring Your A Game V

Slay 3,000 rank A elite marks




Bring Your S Game V

Slay 2,000 rank S elite marks





So, in total, you‚Äôre going to have to take down 5,000 marks in The Hunt, but not just any marks. A rank and S rank m‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Mods are everything to your success in Warframe. You won&#x27;t be able to succeed beyond the earliest levels without them, and you&#x27;ll find yourself severely underpowered if you don&#x27;t learn how to best utilize them. 


The right mod build can take a weapon from barely dealing with level 10 enemies to demolishing level 200 enemies like they&#x27;re paper. One such mod is useful for your companion but has a weird way to get it. Here&#x27;s how to get the Synth Deconstruct mod in Warframe.


Where to get the Synth Deconstruct mod in Warframe

The Synth Deconstruct mod is exclusively available through Fortuna bounties. More specifically, it&#x27;s available from the final stage of the Level 20-40 Fortuna bounty as a rotating reward. This means you may need to wait for another rotation before Synth Deconstruct is a possible reward. Bounties will cycle new rewards every 150 minutes, which itself is a double-edged sword.


Alongside Synth Deconstruct, you can earn yourself a small handful of Endo, Garuada&#x27;s Neuroptics, Aya, Medical Debt-Bonds, and various other resources. If you don&#x27;t score Synth Deconstruct immediately, you&#x27;ll at least be saving yourself some time elsewhere.


Is Synth Deconstruct worth using?


At max rank, Synth Deconstruct will cause enemies injured by your companion to have a 25% chance to drop a Health Orb when killed. It gains additional bonuses when run with other Synth mods, causing your holstered Primary and Secondary weapons to reload their magazines passively. While Synth Deconstruct isn&#x27;t great on its own, several mods and Arcanes benefit from the increased Health Orb drops. Most notably, the Health Conversion mod causes Health Orbs to grant stacking Armor.

Not to be confused with Trogdor the dragon, Trogs are humans degenerated by the TDC which puts them somewhere in between feral ghouls and super mutants.¬†


Trogs are an enemy that was first introduced in The Pitt, a Fallout 3 DLC. They‚Äôre hairless, crawl on all fours, and share similar attack patterns with feral ghouls. The most disturbing part about a Trog is that they are capable of partial speech. Hearing their voice lines as a pack of them gallop around you can quickly turn Fallout 76 into a horror game.

                              <span>Now that Diablo 4 has a loot system that&#x27;s way less about micromanagement and way more about customizing your gear, we&#x27;ve all run out of excuses for neglecting our defenses. Sure, &quot;Shadow Resistance&quot; is a lot less exciting of an affix than &quot;+% Damage,&quot; but when Varshan smacks your poor little health globe for all it&#x27;s worth, your damage isn&#x27;t going to matter too much.


Sources of resistance


There are several &quot;sources&quot; of Diablo 4&#x27;s various resistances, so let&#x27;s look at these first:



Natural affix rolls: These come on gear &quot;as is,&quot; or they can be Enchanted onto gear by replacing an existing affix


Tempering affixes: Using the &quot;Natural Resistance&quot; Tempering Manual, you can roll for a random elemental resistance affix at the Blacksmith

                              <span>Playing multiplayer games on your own is, in some ways, self-defeating. Why on earth are you even trying to do that, when you&#x27;re self-flagellating yourself into sub-par performance and progression? Well, if you&#x27;re anything like me, that doesn&#x27;t matter, and you too play Helldivers 2 solo all day long.


Before moving onto the discussion of whether playing Helldivers 2 on your own is a fool&#x27;s errand or not, there&#x27;s some context I need to share: yours truly has been doing this well before Helldivers 2 was even on the docket. Heck, I spent a non-insignificant amount of time playing the first Helldivers game solo. Payday 2, too, as well as Destiny 2, Warframe, and a downright ridiculous number of other games that specifically bill themselves on being dedicated co-op experiences.

In XDefiant&#x27;s first year, Ubisoft plans to add four factions, 12 weapons, 12 maps, private matches, and a ranked mode. For the first six weeks, XDefiant will be in a preseason period, and then Season 1 will add the first batch of new content. In the absence of new weapons and maps, Ubisoft introduced Twitch Drops as an alternative method to earn cosmetic items.

ML - SPF


First things first, if you find yourself struggling to run Manor Lords on your PC, you&#x27;ll want to try installing the ML - SPF mod by xowny.

You can fast travel to any landmark you&#x27;ve visited on the map, you can pick up resources while on horseback, and unlike every other open-world game, you aren&#x27;t faster or slower than the person you&#x27;re trailing. 


One common feature however is only present in a limited capacity. Here&#x27;s whether you can change the time of day in Ghost of Tsushima.


Can you change from day to night in Ghost of Tsushima?


It&#x27;s sadly impossible to pass the time in the conventional way in Ghost of Tsushima. There&#x27;s no Skip Time button or key, and you can&#x27;t go to a location to sleep and wait. That being said, there are other ways you can do it depending on your use case. Fast traveling to a location will pass some time, though the amount isn&#x27;t predetermined. If you want it to be a specific time of day or night, you&#x27;ll have to keep fast traveling until it is.

Alternatively, there&#x27;s an easy way to change the time if you&#x27;re trying to set up the perfect photograph. Activate Photo Mode, then scroll down until you reach the Time of Day setting. Here you can use a slider to select the exact time of day you want for your photo. It&#x27;ll go back to the time it was when you left Photo Mode, but it&#x27;s enough to get the picture just right. You can change a host of other settings here too, like Jin&#x27;s emotion, the contrast, and so on.

Fantasia allows you to make changes to your character, from simply changing the shape of your eyes to changing your race entirely. It‚Äôs a good way to switch things up, but it can be a little complicated if you‚Äôve never done it before.¬†

There is currently a single quest in Final Fantasy XIV which rewards a Phial of Fantasia, the level 50 MSQ quest ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Weapon‚Äù.

                              <span>There&#x27;s nothing more exciting in the world of Fortnite than a new seasonal update, and if you&#x27;re looking forward to the battle royale&#x27;s Chapter 5, Season 3 patch, we&#x27;ve got a countdown timer that will tell you exactly how long you have left to wait. 


The good news is that we&#x27;re just days away from the Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3 update, which is currently scheduled to launch on Friday, May 24, 2024. 


The game will go into downtime at around 4 am ET / 1 am PT / 9 am BST and will remain offline for around five hours. During this time, Epic will be adding all the new content to the game, and making sure the game is stable enough for you to enjoy. Fortnite should come back online at around 9 am ET / 6 am PT / 2 pm BST, and we&#x27;ve set the countdown timer below to that time. 



Should the update get pushed back due to glitches, issues, or any unforeseen circumstance, we&#x27;ll update this article accordingly.

What to expect in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3


Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t know a lot about what&#x27;s confirmed for the new Fortnite season just yet, but we do know for sure that a special Fallout crossover is coming, perfectly timed following the success of the Amazon Prime TV show. 


We also expect that a new Battle Bus will be added this week, as the old one got smashed to smithereens by a real-life monster truck this past weekend, and Fall Guys assets should finally arrive here too.


As for leaks, there have been rumors of Klombo, the Fortnite mascot, coming to the game&#x27;s LEGO mode, and claims of both Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Four crossovers. Those are unconfirmed though, so take them with a pinch of salt.

In a recent CNBC interview (spotted and shared by Twitter user Dyllie), Zelnick was asked about the decision-making behind choosing a release window.


&quot;Well, there is slippage in the industry, and we&#x27;re not immune from that,&quot; said Zelnick. &quot;However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing.&quot;

                              <span>At the end of last week, Ghost of Tsushima was released on Steam, bringing with it additional content in the guise of it being the Director&#x27;s Cut. Since then, the PlayStation exclusive game has been doing pretty well for itself, and has become one of the console&#x27;s most successful ports on PC.


As of right now, Ghost of Tsushima has beaten out God of War ‚Äì another PlayStation exclusive title ‚Äì in terms of concurrent players. According to SteamDB, the former registered 77,154 players over the last 24 hours, while the latter achieved 73,529 players at its peak a couple of years ago.




Additionally, Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered shows 66,436 players from two years ago. At the time of writing, Sucker Punch&#x27;s samurai warrior game is the top-selling game on Steam, being just behind the Steam Deck handheld system.


Note the words &quot;single-player&quot;


However, there is one PlayStation-to-PC release that Ghost of Tsushima is probably going to struggle to keep up with, and that&#x27;s Helldivers 2. However, Ghost is still proving itself to be a mighty singleplayer game to make the leap from Sony&#x27;s console to Steam.


That&#x27;s fair, though. Helldivers 2 has been a phenomenal hit since launching earlier this year, becoming one of PlayStation ‚Äì and therefore Sony&#x27;s ‚Äì most lucrative new release in a good while. As of three months ago, the game registered a whopping 458,709 concurrent players.


Ghost of Tsushima was originally a PS4 title, releasing in 2020, before making its way onto PS5 in 2021, so it&#x27;s taken about three years for it to arrive on PC.


Although it&#x27;s been getting some pretty good feedback from the community, more than a few have been showing concern about players needing a PlayStation Network account in order to play online through Steam.

Where to watch online: Not officially available for streaming in the US.



Let&#x27;s be honest, the &#x27;90s were the golden era for Capcom anime. Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge is a four-part OVA series that covers the events of the second game of the Darkstalkers franchise. Although not without flaws, the series offe‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ve likely heard the joke conspiracy theory that birds aren&#x27;t real and/or are government drones (if you haven&#x27;t, please treat yourself). Well, one Fallout 4 modder wondered what it would be like if that was a reality in the dystopian RPG.


Perhaps more out of general annoyance for the flying critters rather than confirming to an online joke, Nexus Mods user Capra has turned Fallout 4 into a birdless paradise. Specifically, the mod takes aim at crows and &quot;seagulls&quot; (though they&#x27;re likely referring to radgulls).

After getting frustrated with them, Capra decided to take action, removing them from the game. It doesn&#x27;t affect gameplay or lore in any way, and chances are many of us who play can easily ignore any and all birds, but it&#x27;s there if you want it.


Birdemic, or lack thereof


Technically, the modder hasn&#x27;t actually deleted the birds from Fallout 4. What they&#x27;ve actually done is replace both the crows and gulls with &quot;empty textures,&quot; made them unkillable, and basically muted their sounds. In summary: they&#x27;re there but not there at the same time.


Now, I&#x27;m wondering whether the concept of irradiated birds that are invisible, indestructible, and silent is actually more of an issue than them just not being in the game at all. I&#x27;ll leave you to ponder that.


I looked into it, and apparently, Fallout 4 only has these two types of birds throughout the whole game (with a brief mention of sparrows during some dialogue). This means you can wander the wastelands of Boston City assuredly confident that birds do not, in fact, exist.*


*as good as.

Join Wesley LeBlanc, Marcus Stewart, and me for a look at the game&#x27;s opening moments on Xbox Series X and a discussion about the state of the genre that System Shock arguably invented.

                              <span>Developer Player First Games and publisher Warner Bros. Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, MultiVersus, seemingly revealing¬†Friday the 13th&#x27;s¬†Jason Voorhees and The Matrix&#x27;s¬†Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week.¬†
After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on¬†the Iron Throne of¬†Game of Thrones¬†fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster.¬†
Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below:¬†


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.¬†

                              <span>Larian Studios, the team behind last year&#x27;s Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, has opened a new studio in Warsaw, Poland. Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher&#x27;s seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec.¬†
&quot;With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland&#x27;s lively gaming scene,&quot; the company&#x27;s announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads.¬†


As for what those two RPGs are, don&#x27;t expect a sequel to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian&#x27;s CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 ‚Äì so no expansions ‚Äì and the Baldur&#x27;s Gate series in general.¬†
Over on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now.¬†
&quot;Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world ‚Äì Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers; that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.&quot;¬†

Its strategy fundamentals were already strong enough to impress me in 2022 that it&#x27;s been quite tricky to even remember what&#x27;s changed. But there&#x27;s more of it, and although after much reflection I think it&#x27;s not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

                              <span>Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee‚Äôs choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it‚Äôs a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that‚Äôs outright good fun in itself.

                              <span>There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

                              <span>You remember the ending of 2011&#x27;s first-person bullethoser Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, right? Everyone does! A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

All very upbeat. Well, hold that thought, because on the 21st, it&#x27;s time for Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2, another slice of Celtic sort-of-psychosis from Ninja Theory, which is as grim as the accompanying Paper Trail is *checks Nic&#x27;s review* incredibly annoying?

The developers behind the iOS app Delta, which lets users emulate thousands of Nintendo games on iPhone and iPad, have hastily updated the app&#x27;s logo after receiving legal threats from Photoshop creator Adobe (thanks, The Verge).
In an update via the App Store, the notes simply state &quot;Adobe threatened legal action unless we changed our app icon - so we did! Hope y&#x27;all like it :)&quot;. The new permanent logo is yet to be revealed, but for now, the old logo has been humorously amended to avoid any potential similarities.

Super Smash Bros. developer Masahiro Sakurai has frequently demonstrated his desire to make game experiences as smooth and accessible as possible for the player.
In a recent livestream event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Hamster&#x27;s Arcade Archives series, he talked on-stage with fellow creator Hideki Kamiya (Bayonetta, Resident Evil 2) and spoke of how the GameCube title Kirby Air Ride was originally meant to include Dolby Surround, but he abandoned the idea in favour of cutting down player wait time (thanks, Automaton).

Capcom is one of the titans of the gaming industry, and among its most successful and powerful franchises is Monster Hunter. Yet it‚Äôs easy to forget that, for many years, the series was exclusive to one platform holder ‚Äì first Sony systems and then a spell with Nintendo starting with Monster Hunter Tri on Wii. On top of repeated exclusivity, it took a while to establish much of a footing outside of Japan, and even then it was still impenetrable and inaccessible for a lot of gamers. Too difficult, demanding, time-consuming, or downright unintuitive ‚Äî outside of a dedicated base of fans (this scribe included), it was largely ignored.
Gradually, oh so gradually, Capcom decided to make the series more accessible. The mainline games began to add more mobility and gameplay styles in the Nintendo era, nowhere near as open to a wide audience as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, but on the way to reaching more players. The 3DS entries in particular started that push but still eventually beat up hunters that dared to reach the endgame; then Monster Hunter Stories arrived on Nintendo‚Äôs little system and offered an alternative, a gentle hug as an introduction to the series.

Atari has announced that NeoSprint, the first &#x27;Sprint&#x27; entry since 1987&#x27;s Championship Sprint (well, technically 1989&#x27;s Badlands), will be racing onto the Switch eShop next month on 27th June, 2024.
As detailed in the newly released trailer, the game will feature modernised visuals with an updated isometric view of the action. You&#x27;ll also be able to build and completely customise your own tracks, adding in ramps, jumps, and decorative items across four biomes: forest, desert, winter, and city.

                              <span>Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.
As reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It&#x27;s not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year&#x27;s highest-grossing horror film,¬†Blumhouse‚Äôs highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days.¬†
The tagline for Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s 2 reads, &quot;Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.&quot; The sequel‚Äôs cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles.¬†
FNAF 2 won&#x27;t be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a great time to be a Fallout fan, thanks to its excellent Amazon Prime series and the next-gen update for Fallout 4. But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn&#x27;t died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite&#x27;s official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon

May 17, 2024
The teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there&#x27;s not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite&#x27;s current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it&#x27;s anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.
It will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it&#x27;s unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.
For more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with¬†Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its¬†huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.

                              <span>Yesterday, EA Sports College Football 25‚Äôs cover athletes and release date were revealed. Today, the game‚Äôs first full trailer provides the look at it in action.¬†
The trailer shows that EA is seemingly going all out to replicate the pomp and passion of college football, with over-the-top team entrances, marching band performances, and mascots galore. It remains to be seen how fun or different the on-field action is compared to its Madden counterpart, but the game at least seems to capture the school spirit.¬†


EA also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in this gallery.¬†

EA Sports College Football 25 launches on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can learn more about its various editions, pricing, and features here.</span>

                              <span>Hades II has taken the gaming world by storm, and I&#x27;m not just saying that because it&#x27;s the subject of our current cover story. But while many have been surprised by the sheer volume of content available so far, it&#x27;s still in Early Access, so the team at Supergiant will be updating and patching it for the foreseeable future. The first of those patches came today, and it adds a few small quality-of-life improvements.
Our first Early Access patch for Hades II is out now on Steam and the Epic Games Store!! We&#x27;re very grateful for all the feedback so far, which inspired this first set of targeted improvements and fixes.

                              <span>Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year&#x27;s Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to¬†The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales.¬†
After acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year ‚Äì save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown ‚Äì and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers.¬†


However, this new report from¬†The Wall Street Journal¬†seemingly clears the air around that topic.¬†
&quot;Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,&quot; the story reads.¬†
Of course, things could change so we&#x27;ll see what happens. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.

                              <span>2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K&#x27;s biggest franchises are prime for a new game.¬†
As for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That&#x27;s less than a month away so we don&#x27;t have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be.¬†

May 16, 2024
While there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock.¬†
The last mainline Borderlands entry ‚Äì Borderlands 3 ‚Äì hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action¬†Borderlands¬†movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you&#x27;re looking for something to play through in that universe.¬†
On the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition ‚Äì a remake ‚Äì in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement.¬†
BioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It&#x27;s been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here&#x27;s what we want in a BioShock 4.¬†
SGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†summer gaming showcase schedule.¬†

                              <span>As you might‚Äôve heard, Hades 2 is out in early access, offering up the much-anticipated sequel to Supergiant‚Äôs mythical (and delightfully thirsty) roguelite. Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can‚Äôt be too far down the line, the game‚Äôs creative director reckons we‚Äôve still got around a year to wait before it‚Äôs considered all finished up.

Details and screenshots for Deadlock, a third-person hero shooter with MOBA elements, have seemingly leaked out of a recent closed playtest, revealing a blend of Overwatch, Dota 2 and Valve‚Äôs own Team Fortress 2.

Working on a new series of story-driven, triple-A games.

                              <span>I love building games, but it&#x27;s not that often that put one down and feel particularly tempted to get straight back into it again. Of Life And Land is one of those, but thankfully not so much so that it threatens to consume my every waking moment.
It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead. In a word: it&#x27;s lovely.

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It‚Äôs far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What‚Äôs really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.

                              <span>You might remember Enotria: The Last Song as the Italian-inspired Soulslike that shifted its release date from June to August to avoid Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree... but found itself nestled next to Black Myth: Wukong. Well, scratch that August release, as now it&#x27;s been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there&#x27;s a demo coming out real soon that&#x27;ll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game&#x27;s like. I imagine it&#x27;ll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they&#x27;ve decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls&#x27; bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man&#x27;s stats were specced high.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare&#x27;s big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I&#x27;m particularly proud of. I&#x27;m not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there&#x27;s a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.
I find this list of mods interesting! It&#x27;s a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it&#x27;s very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there&#x27;s at least one item on there I&#x27;d push back on, but also this isn&#x27;t really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.

                              <span>Hell-wandering roguelike Hades 2 has received its first proper patch, and it does everything the developers said it would. You now sprint faster and, significantly, you can gather more than one type of crafting resource per run (as long you&#x27;ve unlocked the tool that lets you gather that resource). This  means Melino√´ can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night&#x27;s work. There is a catch though.

                              <span>Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you‚Äôre saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the Principality of Sealand, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude‚Äôs Endless Legend, which is 100% off on Steam  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.

Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has opened a new student-taught class which delves into the game design of the Fire Emblem series. Yes, Fire Emblem. At university. And there we were thinking that &#x27;Film Studies&#x27; sounded cool.
&#x27;Fire Emblem Design and Analysis&#x27; will be getting underway at Carnegie Mellon in the Fall semester of this year and promises to help students &quot;gain a deeper understanding of the game design, mechanics and writing of the Fire Emblem series&quot;. To do this, the class will be examining such topics as the evolution of game mechanics (durability and the weapon triangle both get a shoutout), unit archetypes and series lore before being graded via in-class quizzes and projects.

The years straddling the turn of the millennium were tumultuous for Sega and its fans. The launch of the Dreamcast in 1999 following a series of hardware missteps and company infighting was exciting, but the system failed to gain sufficient traction despite its innovations and array of patented blue-sky software. News in early 2001 that Sega would quit the hardware business to develop games on other platforms rocked fans to the core, but within a matter of months the company&#x27;s debut GameCube title ‚Äî adapted from the arcade original that debuted in June &#x27;01 ‚Äî would demonstrate that, despite Dreamcast&#x27;s demise, Sega&#x27;s inimitable arcade style and spirit was alive and well.
Super Monkey Ball felt like a mission statement when it arrived as a GameCube launch title. With a premise as zany as it was instantly understandable, you shift a free-floating course below the feet (well, ball) of your monkey to guide them to a goal while collecting bananas. Simple! The game was a blast of colourful arcade fun from Sega veteran Toshihiro Nagoshi and signalled to fans not to worry, everything was going to be just fine.

Here are some initial benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen 5 8400F in putting it up against 230+ benchmarks under Linux while also monitoring the CPU power consumption and comparing it to Intel&#x27;s closest contender as the Core i5 1440F that retails for just under $200.</span>

                              <span>Grand Theft Auto VI&#x27;s reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we‚Äôre nearly midway through 2024, it appears we‚Äôll have to wait another full year before playing it.
Publisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher‚Äôs upcoming releases, posted below.
Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, ‚ÄúWe are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.‚Äù The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned.¬†
Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise&#x27;s parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record.¬†
As we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI‚Äôs launch, check out our video of Game Informer‚Äôs two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer.

                              <span>Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director&#x27;s Cut, is out on PC today. It&#x27;s a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve&#x27;s handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It&#x27;s not without its shortcomings ‚Äì a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game ‚Äì but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that&#x27;s your only option or you want a portable version.
You can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.

Shortly after Carpenter reported that, Phoenix Labs released the following statement:¬†


Phoenix Labs released its latest game, Fae Farm, back in September, and Dauntless before that in 2019.¬†
These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year.¬†

                              <span>EA Sports College Football finally has a release date, cover stars, and two different editions. The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.
Gracing the cover of the game‚Äôs Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.

The cover reveal comes a day before the game&#x27;s full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it&#x27;s being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.
Both editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.¬†
The $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.
Lastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.</span>

                              <span>Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new &quot;narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.&quot; The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from¬†IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project.¬†
This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today&#x27;s public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It&#x27;s why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs.¬†


&quot;Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,&quot; a blog post reads. &quot;The team&#x27;s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision&#x27;s resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development.¬†
&quot;Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.&quot;¬†
Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division, and Far Cry.¬†

                              <span>Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024&#x27;s surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.
Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.¬†¬†


Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city‚Äôs community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way.¬†
Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game‚Äôs 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It‚Äôs off to a great start, though, and we‚Äôre curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.</span>

                              <span>You will need an internet connection to install Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, but after that, the entire experience can be played offline, Ubisoft has announced. The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game.¬†
Following the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we&#x27;ll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that&#x27;s not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air.¬†


&quot;Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, following some questions we&#x27;ve noticed in the community,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection.¬†

&quot;We are super excited to bring Assassin&#x27;s Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.&quot;¬†

As you can see, it&#x27;s clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG.¬†
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S,¬†Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.
For more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†ranking of the entire Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

Some games provide you with abstract titles that don&#x27;t fully explain the breadth of the tasks you will be required to complete to reach the end. Please Fix The Road does not suffer from that problem. As you play through 160 bite-sized puzzles, each one simply asks you to do exactly what this game&#x27;s title says: fix the road, path, sidewalk, or river so that vehicles and animals can reach their d‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>There are exactly one million metroidy rogueishy action platform games and that is okay. There&#x27;s no such thing as too many of an entertaining thing in a world with, god I dunno, at least thousand humans in? Maybe more? Who knows.
They are rarely my thing, though. I try more than I really want to, for you, and games like Biomorph give me the energy to keep going through the many that leave me indifferent. This isn&#x27;t one of my grudging admissions that a subgenre isn&#x27;t all bad; it&#x27;s a game that I can&#x27;t even think of a way to complain about.

                              <span>Fans of odd games with multiple endings and themes of identity and oppression, rejoice! Or, maybe, not rejoice. Time will tell. In the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, Yosuke Saito, the series producer for Nier, teased that he might be working on something new with Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe, the director and composer for the Nier series, respectively.
Via Gematsu and PCGamer, Saito said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I‚Äôll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) That‚Äôs about all I can say for now.‚Äù Thanks for the clarity, Saito.

That&#x27;s according to recent job listings on Absurd&#x27;s website (cheers Gamesradar for the spot), which mention such a thing. And to be honest, are any of us surprised? Not really. Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.

Having recently cleared up the question around whether you‚Äôll need to sign in with a PSN account after the Helldivers 2 debacle - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won‚Äôt work on Steam Deck.

One of those heroes will also be the series‚Äô first playable real-life figure: the African samurai Yasuke.

Come on, Terry. No you haven‚Äôt. You spend weekends eating custard creams and watching Bake Off. You haven‚Äôt thought about brutalism since undergrad, be honest. Anyway, my version of that is Starship Troopers. As in, I‚Äôve been waiting for a videogamey excuse to bang on about it in public for ages. Helldivers 2 is obviously as good an excuse as any, but really, I needn‚Äôt have waited so long. Official offerings like strategy game Starship Troopers: Terran Command and FPS Robocop: Rogue City aside, I reckon you can find Paul Verhoeven‚Äôs fingerprints all over games.

I promise, I approached Little Kitty, Big City with an open heart, because I do really like cats. But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough. This is a bold claim, because there are more than 40 to collect.

                              <span>Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.
Once a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3‚Äôs performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.

                              <span>The characters in Read Only Memories: Neurodiver are deeply into anime. They love manga and figurines and trashy movies and horror novels. The interests of the game&#x27;s creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel&#x27;s loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime&#x27;s commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game&#x27;s name (&quot;Neurodiver!&quot;). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.

                              <span>Last week, I watched one of my favourite badminton players Kento Momota play his final match. As he stepped off court for the last time, I found myself welling up. He doesn&#x27;t know me - of course he doesn&#x27;t - and I don&#x27;t know him. But for ten years I&#x27;d watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn&#x27;t only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a &#x27;game&#x27; of badminton uniquely his. And for a magical two years, he had the best game in the world.

                              <span>I have a couple of takes on Nico Papalia&#x27;s new RPG Athenian Rhapsody, which launched on Steam yesterday and still has a demo. The first is that it&#x27;s a brighter, glitzier version of Toby Fox&#x27;s Undertale that looks like it belongs on Gameboy Advance - a retro parody created in GameMaker whose turn-based combat houses many an inventive minigame, and whose writing doesn&#x27;t so much break the fourth wall as moonwalk along the parapet, showering the player in poop, anime tropes and off-colour mental health advice.

                              <span>Wayfinder, currently a free-to-play RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, is undergoing a pretty drastic change in its upcoming Echoes patch. Right now it&#x27;s a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it&#x27;ll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that&#x27;s alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It&#x27;s often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.

                              <span>The Sims 4 is nothing if not a teetering jenga tower of updates and add-ons and DLC packs, and the latter half of 2024 will be no exception for EA&#x27;s life sim king. Yesterday saw the release of an update to the base game&#x27;s swimwear, kicking off the updates teased in the recently-revealed new roadmap, Season Of Love. The roadmap video&#x27;s vibe is that it and its partner saw you from across the bar and wondered if you&#x27;d be interested in joining them, and it kind of weirds me out.

                              <span>I think most would agree that the artist formerly known as Twitter has never been in more need of a thermonuclear cleansing. The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you&#x27;re talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm&#x27;s perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.
Still, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to &quot;take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results&quot;. Other developers have heeded the call. Here&#x27;s a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0&#x27;s (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.

                              <span>Old-school FPS adventure The Explorator contains much more intense shooty violence than the adorable lizardy folk that populate it might immediately suggest. I really want to use the word ‚Äòzany‚Äô without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I‚Äôm afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I‚Äôll go with ‚Äòcaffeinated‚Äô I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it‚Äôs got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you‚Äôre here for the violence.

Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it&#x27;s finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders. And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.

                              <span>Do you love the smell of napalm in the morning? If so, you&#x27;ll probably love the smell of Valheim&#x27;s Ashlands biome, which has just launched for all players after a period of beta testing.

                              <span>Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.
Ubisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,
‚ÄúAs part of Ubisoft‚Äôs efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.‚Äù


The Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination.¬†
Despite the cancellation, we know it doesn&#x27;t mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window.¬†
Heartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.</span>

As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan&#x27;s first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.
This dual protagonist approach isn&#x27;t too surprising given it&#x27;s Ubisoft Quebec developing the game ‚Äì it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey¬†and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate¬†‚Äì but it&#x27;s exciting nonetheless.

Last month, I had a chance to play Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble, the first all-new entry in the Super Monkey Ball (SMB) franchise in more than a decade. While I went into the demo skeptical that the series, which experienced its best years in the early-to-mid 2000s, could feel like a modern experience in 2024, I emerged from the demo impressed by the gameplay improvements, single-player level design, and the game&#x27;s approach to multiplayer (you can read my full preview here).¬†

                              <span>HBO/Max has released the first look at Pedro Pascal&#x27;s Joel and Bella Ramsey&#x27;s Ellie in Season 2 of The Last of Us, and the scenery looks familiar. As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today&#x27;s images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year.¬†
Pascal&#x27;s Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game&#x27;s beginning where snow is abundant.¬†

This update from the Hi-Fi Rush X account comes roughly one week after Xbox shut down the game&#x27;s developer, Tango Gameworks, alongside Redfall studio Arkane Austin, and two more Bethesda teams. While there won&#x27;t be any more Hi-Fi Rush content coming from Tango Gameworks, hopefully today&#x27;s patch puts the game in the best playable state possible so that future players can enjoy the 2023 hit.¬†
Thank you all for your continued support.

The closure of Tango Gameworks arrived roughly a year after the team delivered the extremely well-received Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox&#x27;s own admitted metrics, was a big success. A few days after the closure of these studios, Xbox president Sarah Bond addressed the situation, stating that it&#x27;s about keeping the business healthy in the long-term.¬†

The first Mortal Kombat movie in this rebooted film series hit theaters on April 23, 2021, and¬†Game Informer¬†had a great time with it ‚Äì read our 8 out of 10 review to find out why here. Here&#x27;s hoping we enjoy the sequel just as much, if not more.¬†
Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid will return to direct Mortal Kombat 2, and it will be written by a new writer, Jeremy Slater (alongside McQuoid), who wrote Disney&#x27;s Moon Knight series. Alongside returning cast and characters,¬†The Boys¬†Karl Urban will join the fight as Johnny Cage.¬†
For more Mortal Kombat, read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†Mortal Kombat 1 review, and then check out John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker debut in the game here.¬†¬†

Apparently each day will offer up &quot;a new free Character Creator item representing a different year of Minecraft history.&quot;

This also means I&#x27;ve been playing Minecraft for nearly fifteen years. Do I care for Character Creator items? No. Will I be signing in each day on my son&#x27;s account to get him the free thing? Absolutely.

Nagai Industries founder Dima Shen has been obsessed with that unassuming Tomato Convenience Store since he was a teenager, partly for the contrast it offers to the rest of the game. &quot;Shenmue was a really depressing game, I would say - your father is killed, it&#x27;s always raining,&quot; he tells me. &quot;But there&#x27;s one kind of super-healthy place in the whole game: a convenience store!&quot;

                              <span>My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam&#x27;s acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He&#x27;s a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I&#x27;ve been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I&#x27;d say I got my teeth into it, but I&#x27;m not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it&#x27;s release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it&#x27;s drawn for itself.  

It&#x27;s balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam&#x27;s first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I&#x27;d feared, when you&#x27;re playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.

                              <span>I booted up Dread Delusion and fell 30 feet to my death. This throwback first-person RPG is hazardous, and not only due to the dreamlike islands floating in the sky. My leg-snappin&#x27; plummet may be down to early access changes, causing the ground to be updated from right under my feet. Far from being a nuisance, meta-jank like this only endears me further to Dread Delusion. It is an RPG from the other side of some attic mirror, an Elder Scrolls from a parallel 2002. It has, somehow, slipped into our reality and is seeing its full release today. There are gods you can thank for this, but we dare not speak their names.

A bunch of players are competing to cross the finish line of a brutally difficult tower of racetracks in racing game Trackmania, with a prize pool of $30,000 waiting for the first three drivers to reach the top. The course is a huge, winding gauntlet made of pieces suspended in midair, and even expert players have fallen from their positions over 1000 times, their cars hurtling back to the bottom of the tower to start again. The top contenders are currently trying to crack a difficult spot to reach the 12th floor, at which point the course will reveal unknown territory. They seem a little tired, which is not surprising. They are 11 days into the event.

A puzzle game named Paper Trail that has you solve discrete head-scratchers by folding the screen like a piece of paper in different ways to create new paths, I might even say, if I were trying to cram a bunch of information right at the top without breaking theme. Let‚Äôs talk about it.

It&#x27;s set in a vaguely ancient Rome-inspired fantasy world brought to life through intricate and inventive ASCII, and scored with homages to the classics. Ah, but how does it play? You exclaim with evident interest, I assume.

                              <span>Genuinely legendary game designer Ron Gilbert ‚Äì whose works include the classic adventure game Monkey Island, the RTS Total Annihilation (as producer), and the term ‚Äúcutscenes‚Äù ‚Äì is making a new game.
The Terrible Toybox website describes it as ‚ÄúClassic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park‚Äù, and one of the other people working on it is Elissa Black, co-designer and writer of the wonderful Objects In Space‚Ä¶ who is also, I‚Äôve just learned from her personal website, working on a retro 90s style turn-based spaceship command game influenced by the 1971 mainframe adaptation of Star Trek. Argh, so many good things in one article.

                              <span>As promised and/or threatened, depending on your perspective, open world game Fallout 4 has gotten some new graphics tweaks and bug fixes to smooth out the bumps caused by its previous ‚Äúnext gen update‚Äù. The update broke a bunch of mods, delayed a few interesting overhaul projects like Fallout London, and generally made everyone shake their fists at the sky and shout ‚ÄúHowaaaard!‚Äù Remember folks: auteur theory unduly credits a single creative for a group effort - the dice that Todd rolls every time he decides whether or not to break the game are also clearly to blame here.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played little of legendary survival sim The Long Dark, or The Short Dark, as I guess it has proven for me. I fell off the game after succumbing to my first wolf. But I&#x27;ve sampled enough to know that adding a &quot;Misery Mode&quot; to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that&#x27;s just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what&#x27;s this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you&#x27;re fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.


It&#x27;s not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It&#x27;s not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you&#x27;ll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.

                              <span>Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch &quot;later this month&quot;, say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melino√´&#x27;s dash and sprint work. We don&#x27;t know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer&#x27;s &quot;distinct style&quot;.

                              <span>A while back Ubisoft revealed about a billion Assassin&#x27;s Creed projects. The first of these to leap into the carefully placed haystack of release was Mirage, which I liked. Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it&#x27;s an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, and it&#x27;s getting an &quot;official cinematic world premiere trailer&quot; debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.
Also, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.

And seemingly by Mullet Mad Jack, the protagonist of a single-player roguelike FPS who would shove draft beers into the skull of a billionaire robot, then shoot him in the gonads. What I&#x27;m trying to say is, Mullet Mad Jack is fashionable and no-nonsense, which makes for a great hang if you&#x27;d like to burn some aggression once in a while.

                              <span>The Casting of Frank Stone, the upcoming narrative horror game set in the Dead By Daylight universe by Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games, has its first gameplay trailer. The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards.¬†
The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you‚Äôd imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters‚Äô relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies.¬†


Similar to Supermassive‚Äôs previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills
The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

From providing the voice of Rucks in Bastion to Red&#x27;s titular Transistor to Hades himself, Cunningham has played a vital part of every Supergiant title. In this rare interview, we ask Logan how he entered the world of voice acting, how he joined Supergiant Games, and which characters are his favorites to play (and which he&#x27;d want to redo).¬†
Game Informer: When did you first discover that you were good at creating or imitating voices?
Logan Cunningham: I don&#x27;t think there was ever a moment that I discovered that. I always did that. From when I was a kid, my brother and I, we would record stupid little...‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by¬†Fleabag¬†star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year&#x27;s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon&#x27;s¬†Fallout¬†series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world.¬†
This series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a &quot;single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft&#x27;s story in the Tomb Raider series.&quot;¬†
&quot;With great IP, the possibilities are endless,&quot; Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. &quot;The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft&#x27;s adventures. We&#x27;re honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we&#x27;re looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.&quot;¬†
This is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix&#x27;s animated series¬†Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider.¬†
If you&#x27;re curious about Crystal Dynamics&#x27; recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

                              <span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game&#x27;s core rules, including the Player‚Äôs Handbook, Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.
The books aren‚Äôt far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.

Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by¬†VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn&#x27;t hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark.¬†


At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4&#x27;s 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told¬†VGC¬†that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation&#x27;s fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks.¬†
On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year.¬†

                              <span>Jake Solomon, former long-time Firaxis designer and director who spearheaded Marvel‚Äôs Midnight Suns and was a lead designer on XCOM: Enemy Unknown, has announced he‚Äôs formed a new company following his departure from Firaxis last February. Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers.¬†
Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They‚Äôre joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims.¬†In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.


The company‚Äôs debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, ‚Äúemphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.‚Äù¬†
‚ÄúThe best stories in games are written by the players,‚Äù said Solomon in the press release. ‚ÄúAt Midsummer we‚Äôre making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.‚Äù
Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.</span>

                              <span>Paper Trail is a neat upcoming indie game, especially if you&#x27;re into papercraft. The adventure stars Paige (get it?), a young girl with the power to fold reality like it&#x27;s made out of paper. She uses this ability to run away from home in pursuit of her dreams, with players solving origami-focused pathfinding puzzles to get her from one scenic locale to the next. Join editors Marcus Stewart, Kyle Hilliard, and Wesley LeBlanc as they take a look at the opening chapter of this pleasant and mind-bending journey.¬†

                              <span>Helldivers 2 is PlayStation&#x27;s fastest-selling game ever, the company has announced in its latest financial earnings call. It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnar√∂k, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle.¬†
Developer Arrowhead Game Studios&#x27; live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game&#x27;s console release ‚Äì Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation.¬†


Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement.¬†
As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!
@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,‚Ä¶
May 14, 2024
Notably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent ‚Äì PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella.¬†

                              <span>Last week, The Joker was announced as the first new fighter joining MultiVersus ahead of its upcoming relaunch this month. The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today‚Äôs new trailer shows off his gameplay.
The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill‚Äôs new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn.¬†


MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.</span>

                              <span>Atlus has announced that the original version of Shin Megami Tensei V will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13. That‚Äôs one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.
On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V‚Äôs Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it‚Äôs been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the best-selling game in the series in January 2022.
The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.
May 13, 2024
Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it‚Äôs likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game (including all DLC) but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons. Think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V. Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.
Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game here, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V here.</span>

The Rogue Prince of Persia, the upcoming roguelike from Dead Cells developer Evil Empire, will double-jump into Early Access on May 27. This new release date follows a delay from the original May 14 release date as a result of Hades II, which is gracing the latest cover of¬†Game Informer, launching into Early Access last week.¬†
Evil Empire delayed The Rogue Prince of Persia&#x27;s Early Access launch to give its team members, their mothers, and players around the world more time with Hades II. The team said at the time The Rogue Prince of Persia would still hit Early Access this month, and now we know it&#x27;s May 27.¬†
The Rogue Prince of Persia&#x27;s new release date is 27th May! If you didn&#x27;t see our previous post, the TLDR is to give people time to play Hades 2, including usüòÑ

Layoffs such as these were suspected following Square Enix&#x27;s latest financial earnings report, which includes a three-year company reboot plan with an &quot;aggressive&quot; multiplatform release strategy¬†after a slide mentioned &quot;structural reforms.&quot; You can see the slide below:¬†

Ubisoft announced on X that the game‚Äôs cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft‚Äôs use of the word ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that‚Äôs the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its Ubisoft Forward presentation less than a month later, on June 10.

Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate &quot;shinobi fantasy.&quot; It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.</span>

                              <span>After rebooting Final Fantasy 7 as the trilogy of Remake, Rebirth and Really, You Went With That? (TBC), Square Enix are now planning to reboot themselves. Among the publishers‚Äô revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on ‚Äúwin[ning] over PC users‚Äù.

                              <span>The story of Manor Lords‚Äô soundtrack begins, as all inspiring tales do, with hunched-over late-night doom scrolling. It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios‚Äô composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He‚Äôd never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.

On the other hand, Google‚Äôs algorithms don‚Äôt like it when you spend whole intros handwringing about Google‚Äôs algorithms, either, so let‚Äôs stop, er, faffing around and speak of Doom. Id Software parent company Zenimax recently trademarked ‚ÄúIDKFA‚Äù, a string of letters that will be of deep significance to original Doom players, and which may therefore be evidence of an impending announcement.

                              <span>Like with getting fancy polyhedral dice sets full of all glitter and wool, buying and owning are two different hobbies when it comes to books. I think this has gotten worse (if that&#x27;s the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It&#x27;s really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption&#x27;s sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).

                              <span>The former lead writer of charming super-fascist simulator Helldivers 2 is working on a strategy and tactics RPG in the vein of Nintendo and Intelligent System&#x27;s Fire Emblem games, which aren&#x27;t available on PC and as such, are a complete mystery to you, a lifelong desktop warrior who would sooner cut their hand off than suffer it to brush against one of those filthy Nintendo witches, I mean Switches. 


To fill you in, Fire Emblem is known and sort of celebrated for being a rich ensemble fantasy story with character permadeath. Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that&#x27;s what. Beyond that, we can only dream.

The concept evidently appeals to me enough to try out those other two, but I guess that I‚Äôm simply too much of a rebel-maverick-disruptor to play to the stiflingly enforced rhythms of somebody else‚Äôs drum. Something about ROBOBEAT‚Äôs roguelike shooting feels different though.

Much like Scorn, Necrophosis is also part-inspired by the dystopian surrealist works of Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, which means lots of plucking brains out of sinewy bodies and plopping them into fleshy receptacles. There&#x27;s a demo out now and while it&#x27;s not outstanding, it tickled my curiosity more than I thought it would.

                              <span>Back in the late 90s when all of you NORMIES were playing Diablo, I was playing a little-known Konami ARPG called Azure Dreams, which has alas never escaped PlayStation prison. It&#x27;s a grid-based, upwardly mobile roguelitey dungeon crawler set in a big tower, each floor a semi-randomised maze of monsters (which you can capture), traps and pick-ups, where player and creature actions happen simultaneously.
Effort Star&#x27;s Enter The Chronosphere doesn&#x27;t have grids or monster capturing, that I know of, but it taps into a comparable vein of diorama-sized frantic-yet-laidback challenge, with characters, foes and projectiles frozen in time till you give a command. There&#x27;s a demo on Steam as part of the platform&#x27;s Endless Replayability Fest, which I encourage you to try, whether you are one of the COOL KIDS who played Azure Dreams or not.

                              <span>Cheese and loyal pets (two important items on Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs) have been added to the co-op survival crafting game Abiotic Factor. The dairy product manifests as various suspiciously coloured cheese wheels which you can cook and eat, while loyalty comes in the form of freakish pets that can now follow your every move. The pets themselves are technically not new to Abiotic Factor, but their player-tracking behaviour is. &quot;There is, as far as we know, no limit to how many pets can follow you at once,&quot; say the devs. Hmmm. I wonder if any scientifically minded folks will test such a hypothesis.

                              <span>There aren&#x27;t many ways left to put a twist on Stardew Valley, but suffixing it with &quot;in space!&quot; oughta do it. Little-Known Galaxy is out in a week, and currently has a demo on Steam, where you can sample many of the delights that you&#x27;re used to from a Stardewlike when you&#x27;re new in town: meeting the locals, growing potatoes, and tidying up the place. Also, raising alien pets, seeking out new life, and new civilisations... It all takes place on a spaceship, you see, and this has some ramifications to playing the game beyond reskinning everything to be shiny metal instead of picturesque mud. It&#x27;s an intriguing proposition.

                              <span>Brass-blasting rhythm game Trombone Champ honked its way into our hearts when it released in 2022. Since then, it&#x27;s garnered a dedicated fanbase that have kept its spit-valve full to bursting with creations like this Final Fantasy 7 mod. Trombone Champ mods are special among rhythm games for consisting of two elements: the button-tapping composition of the song itself, and the background visuals. You honk-tap away while unicorns or giant close-ups of full English breakfasts cavort in the background. Although, if your breakfast is cavorting, you probably want to cook it a bit longer.

                              <span>Some fresh astral god trivia from my accidental molar expedition a few weeks back: each of the Maw&#x27;s teeth is different. Some form a fractal baleen network of crosshatched layers disappearing backward into the vanishing point; others are shaped like lockpicks, raccoon heads and semi-detached houses. This week&#x27;s new game releases are no less motley and misshapen, though thankfully not quite as heavily varnished with plaque: there&#x27;s something in the shop for everyone, I think.

                              <span>Instruments Of Destruction goes to the trouble of having a voiceover offer a preamble to each of its missions, but I don&#x27;t need it. Its launch trailer knows I don&#x27;t need it, as its own voiceover makes clear: &quot;Take this vehicle, destroy those buildings. Do I really need to explain why?&quot;

Nope! You don&#x27;t. And the smashing simulator&#x27;s 1.0 release is out now.

                              <span>Samurai action-adventure Ghost Of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut is due to launch on PC this coming Thursday, May 16th - but it&#x27;ll be available on Steam in nearly 180 fewer countries than expected. That&#x27;s because its online features will require players to sign-in to a PSN account, and PSN accounts are not available in those countries. This is effectively the same issue that recently enraged Helldivers 2 players.

                              <span>Warner Bros., owners of the now-defunct Adult Swim Games publishing label, have contacted some developers about returning ownership of their game&#x27;s Steam pages. The developers of both Small Radios Big Televisions and Duck Game shared the news on X yesterday. It&#x27;s a seeming reversal of Warner Bros. stated policy back in March, when all Adult Swim Games seemed destined to be delisted.

                              <span>At various times, most social media platforms have received criticism for alleged failure to prevent distribution of copyright-infringing content. Few, however, have been threatened with widespread blocking more often than Telegram.

The film is due to be released in 2025 but the allegedly leaked material, posted in an Instagram story by a well-known &#x27;scooper&#x27;, clearly has Disney and Marvel concerned. Through a DMCA subpoena, the movie companies aim to find out who&#x27;s behind the social media account.

Indika is bizarre, surprising, and captivating. It made me question its reality almost as often as its titular protagonist, a young nun tormented by the Devil, doubts her faith. This odd adventure from its aptly named developer Odd Meter may lack some design polish, but the fascinating tale at its core instilled enough faith in me to see it through to the end.¬†
The game unfolds in early 19th-century Russia. Indika is treated as an outcast at her monastery, and, for some reason, she‚Äôs re‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Ever since it came to Switch at the tail end of last summer, Vampire Survivors has been my plane game. Sure, other run-based indies like Balatro and Dead Cells, all-encompassing triple-A titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and retro compilations like Sonic Origins and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, have shared that title, but I always know that when I need to pass time on a flight, no game does so as effectively as Vampire Survivors. Logically, I know that each run will last, at most, 30 minutes, but for some reason, it never feels that way. And because of that, I look down for what feels like 20 minutes, and when I look up, 2 hours have passed.
I travel a lot, so I play Vampire Survivors fairly regularly. Still, each time I turn on the game, developer Poncle ha‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Marvel Studios has cast Ralph Ineson as the planet-eating Galactus for The Fantastic Four.¬†PlayStation 5 players might recognize that name as the voice of Cidolfus Telamon, aka Cid, in Final Fantasy XVI. This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England.¬†
Ineson, whom you might also know from¬†The VVitch,¬†The Northman, and The Creator,¬†joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s first film about Marvel&#x27;s First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).


Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed.¬†
If you&#x27;ve played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can&#x27;t wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four¬†hits theaters on July 25, 2025.¬†

                              <span>Earlier this week, Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks, the team behind last year&#x27;s Hi-Fi Rush. While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent.¬†
However, four days later, Bloomberg&#x27;s Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods.¬†


Here&#x27;s what Bond said:¬†
Bass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox&#x27;s own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond&#x27;s answer here was less straightforward ‚Äì you can read it below in full:¬†
While it&#x27;s great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you&#x27;d expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.
For more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike.¬†

                              <span>Spacefaring RTS Homeworld 3 is good sci-fi. Monolithic structures scorched with plasma burns. Sleek spacecraft. Alien sunrises.  It‚Äôs also good sci-fi because its characters converse through reams of inscrutable but cool-sounding space science, and at no point does a grinning quipster tell a scientist: ‚ÄúWhoa there, professor. Why don‚Äôt you try saying that again... but in English!‚Äù Basically, if your wishlist for Homeworld 3 has tone and atmosphere at the top, rest easy.

                              <span>What is it Wendy Cope wrote? ‚ÄúBloody Fallout 4 patches are like bloody buses. You wait half  a decade for one, and as soon as that one breaks everything, Bethesda releases another just days later.‚Äù Yeah, pretty sure that‚Äôs it. Anyway, Fallout 4 will get another patch for the near decade-old game next week, presumably to help fix a lot of the problems its long-awaited ‚Äúnext-gen update‚Äù introduced two weeks ago.

                              <span>The Rogue Prince of Persia, a game that is pleasingly candid in choosing its name for a roguelite Prince of Persia spin-off, has been delayed. It turns out that developers Evil Empire - they of very good roguelite platformer Dead Cells - saw the Hades 2 train steaming down the tracks, and decided to sensibly dodge-roll out of its way.

                              <span>Copyright holders can claim damages for copyright infringements that occurred years or even decades ago, the U.S. Supreme Court has clarified. In a majority decision, the Court rejected the lower court&#x27;s argument that there&#x27;s a three-year time limit for damages. Older claims are fair game, as long as the lawsuit is filed within three years of &#x27;discovering&#x27; an infringement.

One of the targets is SportsHub, a site that&#x27;s now generating enough traffic to make it one of the UK&#x27;s top 1,000 most-visited sites, period. The surge in traffic coincides with a UK anti-piracy campaign that aims to deter consumption of pirated football streams.
