                              <span>Team Ninja has been back, but I think a lot of folks are just now realizing it
While From Software typically dominates the modern action-adventure conversation (especially after the more considerable success of Elden Ring), many other games are vying for attention. As most of my colleagues know, I constantly sing the praises of recent works from Team Ninja: including both Nioh games.
While there&#x27;s still a lot more of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty for me to see, I&#x27;m two demos in; and I&#x27;m just ready for the thing to come out already.

Skybound Entertainment has made a committed financial investment in indie studio MegaCat Studios, the developer working on fun-looking, ring-rocking RPG WrestleQuest.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Skybound Entertainment has not released a figure for its investment, but the site&#x27;s sources believe it to be in the &quot;multi-million&quot; region. As a publisher Skybound currently holds IPs such as The Walking Dead and Escape Academy, while also owning physical distribution rights for titles such as Cuphead, Psychonauts 2, Untitled Goose Game, Gang Beasts, and more recently Striking Distance Studios&#x27; The Callisto Protocol.

Pittsburgh-based MegaCat Studios has released several low-key titles in its young life, including games for retro platforms such as the NES and the Sega Mega Drive. WrestleQuest represents the indie outfit&#x27;s biggest and most promising title to date, blending strategic RPG combat with the Day-Glo, territory-era world of pro wrestling. Alongside a roster of original characters, WrestleQuest will also star real-world grapplers such as The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter,  Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, Andre the Giant, and Macho Man Randy Savage.
It is reported that MegaCat intends to use Skybound&#x27;s investment to help with the financial side of project development, while also noting that the partnership will give the small studio access to IP and publishing resources. With the release of WrestleQuest just four months away, this exciting venture looks set to propel MegaCat well into 2023 and, hopefully, beyond.
WrestleQuest launches May 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

It&#x27;s Friday, and thus digital retailer Epic Games Store has announced two new titles that it will be offering up to all of its users next week, absolutely free of charge — And it&#x27;s not a bad showing at all this time around, as EGS will be offering its customers Dishonored: Death of the Outsider and City of Gangsters.

                              <span>I asked for no onions on this
The first time I laid eyes on Onion Assault was on the outskirts of GDC back in 2019. I was having a lunch interview with Bertil Hörberg, the solo developer behind the Gunman Clive series and Mechstermination Force. We were there to talk about Mechstermination’s impending release and how its development differed from the Gunman games. In the midst of our conversation, he decided to give me a sneak peek at something else he was working on. It was a new game influenced by the NES classic Super Mario Bros. 2, which I’m sure most of you know was a reskinning of Doki Doki Panic.
This brief, off-the-record preview was merely a morsel, but as a long-time champion of SMB2, I couldn’t wait to see one of my favorite indie developers find inspiration in it.

                              <span>I hope you like pins
Whenever a new first party Nintendo game creeps up, you know it&#x27;s time for a physical My Nintendo reward. Whether it&#x27;s a towel or a keychain (which it is in most cases!), something typically is dumped on the My Nintendo system for people to spend their points on. For Fire Emblem Engage, that physical reward is a pin set.
This is in addition to the current sweepstakes they&#x27;re still running.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Nintendo:
&quot;This reward contains 16 button pins with these iconic heroes from past Fire Emblem series: Emblem Marth, Emblem Celica, Emblem Sigurd, Emblem Leif, Emblem Roy, Emblem Lyn, Emblem Eirika, Emblem Ike, Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Lucina, Emblem Corrin, and Emblem Byleth. The pin set also includes new characters from Fire Emblem Engage: Veyle, Alear, and the adorable Sommie! The reward size: 8&quot;x 8&quot; and each pin size is 1.5 inches.&quot;

Pin set price points typically vary, with the WarioWare set going for 500 Platinum Points (for four larger pins), and the heavy-duty Gold and Platinum point pins going for 800. If you really want these as soon as they&#x27;re available (which is roughly a wait time of 1-2 weeks, sometimes more), aim for having around 1000 points as a buffer.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.
[Update: Nintendo has released the reward on their storefront for 700 Platinum Points. You can find the listing here.]

The developer announced that the Edo-era epic will feature a selection of new &quot;Trooper Cards&quot; — affording our hero new abilities to utilize in battle. The first two of these cards feature video game-loving pro-wrestler Kenny Omega, and charismatic actor Rahul Kohli (Midnight Mass, iZombie).

                              <span>Get your Greninja while you can!
In case you missed it, the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Greninja event is underway, and there are two opportunities to catch it. Once you do get one just like the prior event Pokemon, they can be bred! Here&#x27;s what you get when you do it.

Bring Greninja and Ditto to a picnic
Just like Charizard and Cinderace, you can hatch an egg with a Ditto and a Greninja at a picnic and create a Froakie. This effectively gets by the &quot;only one Greninja can be caught per save file&quot; restriction for the Tera Raid event.
If you need a refresh, we have a full guide on where to find Ditto here, and a comprehensive guide on egg hatching here. All you need to do is wait and you can create multiple eggs to trade away to folks, or keep for yourself.

In Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, Froakie still evolves into Frogadier at level 16, and Greninja at level 36
The evolutionary methodology is the same as the old game line, so you can evolve Froakie into Frogadier (level 16) into Greninja (level 36) on your own terms, and completely raise a brand new Pokemon.
By default, a hatched Froakie comes with the following moves:
Pound (35/35)
Growl (40/40)

                              <span>The road trip adventure gets a musical follow-up
Road 96 was originally released back in 2021 by the creators of Valiant Hearts and 11-11: Memories Retold with its big selling point that it was a procedurally generated narrative game. The story took place in the mid-90s, as characters hitchhiked across the fictional nation of Petria in order to escape its authoritarian regime. While the game didn&#x27;t always stick the landing, it was generally well received, and was considered a successful experiment in trying something totally new when it comes to storytelling in games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3fYO2XC33tQ
Now, two years after Road 96&#x27;s release, developers Digixart have announced that they&#x27;re working on a prequel, which is titled Road 96: Mile 0 and will take place right before the events of the first game. The story will follow two teenagers, Zoe and Kaito (the former is a character players will recognize from the original Road 96), and will switch between them as their journey challenges &quot;their friendship and everything they believe in.&quot;
Mile 0 will also deviate from its predecessor in that it will include playable musical sections, and if that music is anywhere near as catchy as the song playing over the announcement trailer, we&#x27;ll be in for a treat. Road 96: Mile 0 will release on April 4 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

                              <span>There&#x27;s still time
This is your chance to find Greninja in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, as the weekend events have begun. You&#x27;ll have two chances in total, so don&#x27;t miss your opportunity to grab it! Here&#x27;s how to start (and finish) the process of unlocking it, and how to locate it.
Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Greninja events start
January 27-January 28, 2023
February 10-February 12, 2023
First you need to unlock high-end raids
If you haven&#x27;t already, finish up the game (quick, you only have a few more days!), and clear the required post-game questline. This will enable seven-star raids, which can be found on the world map or joined via online play.
We have a full guide on how to unlock them here.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360012,360014&quot;]
Locate the Greninja raid on the main map, and host a raid yourself
When you have the proper requirements unlocked, seven-star raids will appear on your map. You can locate them via flashing poison icons (more info on how to discern specific icons here).
Just head there and interact with the raid den to start a Tera Raid battle. You&#x27;ll want to go online, and use strong Pokemon for seven-star raids: preferably at level 100.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;large&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360010,360011&quot;]
Search for a Greninja raid, even if you don&#x27;t have one available
Alternatively, if you don&#x27;t want to host a raid (or don&#x27;t have any available to trigger), you can search for them online.
Connect to the internet, then select the Poke Portal in the main menu. Select Tera Raid Battle, then search for a Greninja on the list (image silhouette above). As soon as you see it click it: as you&#x27;ll get a lot of competition from would-be players trying to join. If no Greninja raids show up, wait for the &quot;check for new postings&quot; sign to light up: then press X to search again.

My partner is the most patient man I&#x27;ve ever met. It&#x27;s one of the things I appreciate about him the most — especially since I&#x27;m the opposite. He&#x27;s the Lawful Good to my Chaotic Neutral. I&#x27;m a cyclone and he&#x27;s calm waters. Opposites attract, right?
For most of our relationship, this dynamic — his patience, combined with my spontaneity — has made us a pretty great team, able to support each other in exactly the ways that we ourselves are lacking.

For many, the Wario Land games can feel like something of a fever dream today. It&#x27;s been almost 15 years since the last title in the series, Wario Land: Shake It!, came to the Wii and now the thought of Nintendo&#x27;s treasure-obsessed anti-hero getting another platformer of his own seems about as likely as us getting any news on Metroid Prime 4.
However, the fading memories of the series have not stopped developers Tour De Pizza (a fantastic name, we might point out), as it has this week released its debut title Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer inspired by the Wario Land games!

We are used to finding game glitches at a pretty early phase in our playtime (heck, opening week for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet saw our Twitter feeds flooded with &#x27;em), but this isn&#x27;t to say that there aren&#x27;t more out there. One such example has been brought to our attention today and it is, predictably, to do with Super Mario Sunshine.
Anyone who has played Sunshine is bound to have come across the odd glitch once or twice. Perhaps you saw Mario fall through a floor and plummet to his death, or maybe you found yourself leaping in and out of walls like Marvel&#x27;s Nightcrawler. Fortunately, most of these are at the &#x27;freaking annoying&#x27; end of the glitch spectrum; the other end is reserved for those like the Gelato Beach softlock glitch which was recently demonstrated by YouTuber Gaming Reinvented.

One of the most surprising additions to Bayonetta 3 (and for some, one of the most divisive) was the inclusion of Viola, a brand new playable character that looks and feels completely different to the titular heroine we&#x27;re all familiar with. Alongside Viola is her trusty companion, Cheshire, an Infernal Demon who is permanently bound to Viola&#x27;s sword.
Boasting wild visuals and a comical, care-free personality, Cheshire is undoubtedly one of the coolest additions to the franchise (even though it technically appeared in doll form prior to Bayonetta 3) and the good news is that we&#x27;ll be becoming even more acquainted with the character when Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon launches on Switch on March 17th, 2023.

This review originally went live in 2011, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Highly revered by countless N64 owners, GoldenEye 007 is often credited with kick-starting the first-person shooter craze on consoles. It not only showed that a good first-person shooter could be crafted for a machine other than a high-spec PC, but arguably also created the multiplayer FPS phenomenon on consoles. In fact, if it weren&#x27;t for GoldenEye, it&#x27;s quite feasible that franchises such as Halo and Call of Duty might never have experienced the intense popularity that propelled them into the gaming lexicon.

Fire Emblem Engage has been out for one week now and it is fair to say that we loved it (it did get a 9/10 in our review, after all). While many of us who like to have our games in boxes found no issues with getting our hands on the physical edition, it seems that the popular demand of the title meant that not everyone has been quite as lucky, including the game&#x27;s lead voice actor.
Brandon McInnis voices the male version of Alear (&#x27;The Divine Dragon&#x27;) in Engage. If you have played the game already or indeed watched anything from the massive pile of promotion that came in the run up to its release, then you will know that this is a pretty big part. The biggest part (if you play with a male protagonist) in fact. Yet the actor recently took to Twitter to share his difficulties in getting his hands on the game&#x27;s special &#x27;Divine Edition&#x27; come release date.

GoldenEye is now available to play on Nintendo Switch. Ah, how long we&#x27;ve waited to type that sentence! After 25 years as an N64 exclusive, Rare&#x27;s seminal first-person shooter has finally escaped from its 64-bit confines and is now playable via a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription, or on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox.
However, anyone who has tried the game already on Switch may well have run into control issues. Frankly, the way the N64 pad inputs map to a modern dual stick controller is a bit messy to say the least, and the default layout is almost guaranteed to have you pressing the wrong buttons and pulling the wrong trigger — at least to begin with. On Xbox, it seems, the controls have been tweaked for dual-analogue control by default, but not on Switch. It&#x27;s possible to remap buttons at a system level, of course, (and check out the video above to see Alex explain the simple steps), although remapping can be a minor hassle.

Remember in 2020 when the spoon-bending magician Uri Geller publicly apologised for getting Kadabra banned from the Pokémon Trading Card Game and asked Nintendo to bring it back? Well, it seems like it could finally be happening.
According to a story on PokeBeach, a new &quot;sell sheet&quot; for the &quot;Pokémon Card 151&quot; set mentions how the original 151 Pokémon will feature. An &quot;Alakazam ex&quot; card is also named in the set. Geller has shared the following voice message with the source in response to this news - admitting he &quot;was a fool&quot; to sue when Kadabra was &quot;basically a tribute&quot;. Here&#x27;s exactly what he had to say:

                              <span>There was a time, not that long ago if you can believe it, when Microsoft could publish a news blog talking about its plans to make Xbox more environmentally friendly and nobody would really bat an eye. The world would move on, perhaps a little bit less polluted, and that would be that. But those days are gone. Now,…

                              <span>Dead Space returns today with just a few tweaks from devs Motive Studio, and among these are a bevy of accessibility options. One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.

You might think &quot;Alice, it seems like you&#x27;re making the time a guy shouted at you and threw jeans on the floor because they were too long for him everyone else&#x27;s problem, do you think you have some lingering resentment?&quot;, and my response is that you&#x27;ve made a really specific assumption there, I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Anyway, if working in retail was like running the shop in Kardboard Kings, then everyone would love it.

                              <span>You know what’s guaranteed to make me laugh every single time? A good visual gag in a cartoon. A little freak reading a newspaper, for instance. A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that&#x27;s jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

                              <span>Ubisoft are working on two new Far Cry games, according to a new report, including the next mainline entry, Far Cry 7, and a standalone multiplayer offshoot from the series. Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

                              <span>It turns out Forspoken has bigger problems than some badly-landing bantz. The PC version absolutely brutalises low-end hardware, an issue compounded by its high yet often unhelpful system requirements, and framerate drops and stuttering remain common even on some of the best graphics cards around. Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

That&#x27;s right, Hayden gets genuinely excited over a couple of his most anticipated FPS games of the year, and I realise that I&#x27;m less &quot;excited&quot; and more &quot;intrigued&quot; by what&#x27;s on offer. The consensus? We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we&#x27;ve started two new things! We&#x27;re breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

                              <span>Ooh, I&#x27;m glad this made it to a full release. Power of Ten has rattled around my PC since ... I want to say &quot;a year ago&quot;, but that could turn out to be any time in the last three years if I actually check. It didn&#x27;t quite push me over the &quot;Article Threshold&quot; back then, but having given it a proper go now it&#x27;s out of early access, it&#x27;s time.
You&#x27;re a little spaceship, with a simple but intriguing backstory, who&#x27;s appeared near an inhabited planet. A transmission asks you to repair their defensive shield before &quot;the Deadeye&quot; arrives to genocide them, which, uh, okay I think I know whose side I&#x27;m on here, game.

                              <span>Our Dead Space remake review and the associated excitement has me wanting to check out the sci-fi survival horror again, but not quite enough to pay £50 for a new version of a game I already own. So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable. If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here&#x27;s how to get the original working well on PC.

                              <span>Spooky indie pinball hit Demon’s Tilt passed me by in 2019, so I’m pleased the devs have decided to build on their bumper success with a sci-fi-flavoured sequel. Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Above the Berlin Samurai Museum&#x27;s gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I&#x27;ve come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I&#x27;ve played of the game&#x27;s earliest portions, it&#x27;s Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don&#x27;t expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you&#x27;re a fan or a newcomer, it&#x27;s looking like it&#x27;ll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.

Craig Mazin discussed his hopes for the TV version of The Last Of Us while guesting on an upcoming episode of The Playlist Podcast. Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

                              <span>Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he&#x27;s recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac&#x27;s many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

The post-apocalyptic survival MMO was delayed from March to November this week as it turned out the devs hadn&#x27;t actually got the game trademarked, prompting accusations from within the game’s Discord and Reddit communities that it might not exist at all. Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

                              <span>An ancient piracy battle has reached its final verdict at the Dutch Supreme Court. After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

                              <span>Someone claiming to be Elon Musk has bombarded Google with takedown notices recently. The requests urge the search engine to remove listings for T-shirts emblazoned with memes shared by the tech billionaire. Other targets include a copy of a Tesla AI Day t-shirt. While Musk can certainly be unpredictable, there might be an imposter at work.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn&#x27;t surprising because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network.

As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it&#x27;s likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

Linux kernel developer discussions fizzled out last year over handling this DOIT functionality for what is described as a CPU vulnerability with recent Intel CPUs. However, now a Linux kernel patch from a Google developer would enable this change unconditionally for newer Intel CPUs but raises performance concerns.</span>

Meziroční srovnání kvartálů ukazuje, že došlo k velkému propadu prodejů o 18,3 %, což je nejprudší zaznamenaný propad za jedno čtvrtletí a zároveň to stahuje celkové meziroční prodeje o 11,3 %. Za celý loňský rok se prodalo 1,21 miliardy telefonů, což je nejnižší číslo od roku 2013. Ars Technica to označuje za katastrofu pro trh s telefony a jako příčinu uvádí celosvětově rostoucí inflaci a nezaměstnanost.</span>

                              <span>I am fond of Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a trilogy of cooking games which became increasingly ambitious until the third was about operating a food truck on a post-apocalyptic road trip.

Cook Serve Forever looks more ambitious again. It&#x27;s a new game from the same developers with similar combo-tapping food prep at its core, but set in a new solarpunk city. As of today, there&#x27;s a demo you can play and an early access release date set for April.

Hitman 3 is also now called Hitman: World Of Assassination and its multitude of editions, bundles and DLCs have been combined and simplified. As a result, every Hitman 3 owner now has access to all the levels from Hitman 1 and 2, if they didn&#x27;t already.

Today they launched I Commissioned Some Bunnies, where once again they have commissioned artists to draw pictures with hidden animals to find. Still a big fan of that casual descriptive naming scheme. And yup, the pictures are nice, and the rabbits are hidden, and I&#x27;m happy to have spent £3 on it.

                              <span>Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;, which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie&#x27;s treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: &quot;Wooooaaaah.&quot;
Consider the progress of information. It&#x27;s a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It&#x27;s mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

Patrick Mills was a quest designer on The Witcher 3 and senior quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077 for CD Projekt RED, and shared a neat bit of trivia about The Witcher 3’s wandering merchants on his own account this week. Mills revealed that the script for these lads would dish out fixes whatever stage you were at in the game.

                              <span>Well. They certainly remade Dead Space. With some small but welcome exceptions, Dead Space is a one-to-one remake of the 2008 original.


Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

There’s nine games up for keepsies over the course of the month, with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind GOTY Edition standing out at the front of the pack from February 2nd. Members will also get to claim the bathhouse management game Onsen Master, futuristic 3D runner Aerial_Knight&#x27;s Never Yield, and chibi god-brawler Divine Knockout in the first half of the month.

                              <span>After a mysterious delay from December, arcade racing game Hot Wheels Unleashed will finally arrive on PC Game Pass in early February. I hear it&#x27;s pretty good! It&#x27;s one of the small handful of games Microsoft have confirmed as coming to PC Game Pass in the next fortnight, which also include the JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure fighting game and a return to the subscription service for Darkest Dungeon. Alas, games coming mean games going. Do check out Donut County before it&#x27;s swallowed by the abyss.

                              <span>Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you&#x27;ll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Naughty Dog’s co-president Neil Druckmann commented in a Buzzfeed interview that the company is “moving on” from the Uncharted series, and that they’re not feeling pressured into making The Last Of Us Part III.

Earlier this week, I reported on the possibility of this new take on Dead Space getting an alternate ending. The Reunion ending was leaked by an achievements list for the remake, but now the Dead Space Twitter account has confirmed that the game does indeed feature a secret ending. That’s not all, either.

The post doesn’t go over incoming maps, modes, and features that players can expect to see in Season 02, but the devs say they’ll be sharing more on those nearer to the new season’s kick-off time.

                              <span>The Ender Lilies team&#x27;s tactics title aims to launch next month
Redemption Reapers, the new tactical RPG from collaborators behind 2021&#x27;s Ender Lilies, is arriving fairly soon. Developer Adglobe and publisher Binary Haze Interactive announced today that Redemption Reapers will launch on February 22, 2023.
This tactical approach is a fair bit different from the Metroidvania style of Ender Lilies. Redemption Reapers follows a mercenary group called the Ashen Hawk Brigade, fighting as part of humanity&#x27;s last stand against the evil Mort army. It&#x27;s a brigade made up of despised warriors who are nonetheless masters of their craft. And as the commander, the player will try to navigate tactical battles and achieve victory, or fail.
Today&#x27;s gameplay overview goes over just how the Ashen Hawk Brigad…</span>

If you&#x27;ve yet to play Giant Squid&#x27;s gorgeous action-adventure title The Pathless, now&#x27;s your chance, because it&#x27;s finally getting a port to the Nintendo Switch and Xbox next week on February 2. The game is already available to play on pretty much every other platform, including PlayStation, Steam, Epic Games Store, and Apple Arcade. Porting it out to the two remaining major consoles will make The Pathless as widely accessible as it gets, which is a pretty big deal for an indie game.

In the game, the player takes on the role of the Hunter, &quot;a master archer who travels to a mystical island to dispel a curse of darkness that grips the world.&quot; There&#x27;s an emphasis on smooth, acrobatic-like platforming and making slick trick shots alongside an eagle companion who will help you along on your journey. The game even offers some boss fights to add a bit of challenge, but overall, exploring the open world entirely uninhibited will lull you into a soothing flow state in no time.
Giant Squid is also the developer behind the calming diving game Abzû, and they&#x27;ve managed to further build upon their gameplay systems to create a relaxing yet engaging experience with The Pathless. If you&#x27;re looking for a short experience to dive into for an evening, The Pathless is a great bet with the average playthrough coming in at around five hours.

                              <span>The Last of Us is still a little up in the air, though
It sounds like Naughty Dog could be getting past Nathan Drake. In a new interview, co-president Neil Druckmann says the studio is &quot;moving on&quot; from the Uncharted series.
Speaking to Buzzfeed, Druckmann started off discussing a potential The Last of Us Part 3. He says Sony has supported the studio in following its passions. Despite the success of certain games, Druckmann says, there hasn&#x27;t been pressure to keep a series going.
&quot;That&#x27;s not the case,&quot; said Druckmann. &quot;For us, Uncharted was insanely successful—Uncharted 4 was one of our best selling games—and we&#x27;re able to put our final brushstroke on that story and say that we&#x27;re done. We&#x27;re moving on.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hh5HV4iic1Y
For Naughty Dog at least, that sounds like a lid on the Uncharted series, or at least for Nathan Drake&#x27;s portion of it. Though, for The Last of Us, the situation&#x27;s a little different. The team is currently working on its multiplayer experience set in The Last of Us universe, which it plans to share more info on this year. But The Last of Us Part 3? That&#x27;s a different question.
&quot;Likewise, with The Last of Us, it&#x27;s up to us whether we want to continue it or not,&quot; said Druckmann. &quot;Our process is the same thing we did when we did Part 2, which is if we can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love—just like the first and second game did—then we will tell that story. If we can&#x27;t come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end.&quot;
The last Last of Us
While Druckmann&#x27;s comments indicate Naughty Dog is moving on from Nathan Drake, it could still leave the window open for other studios to pick up the series. Either way, The Last of Us multiplayer is what we know Naughty Dog is working on for sure, as its adaptation keeps rolling on over at HBO.

                              <span>Still waiting on that Annette comeback...
Stalk &#x27;n&#x27; slasher Dead by Daylight is getting set to celebrate the suitably spooky Lunar New Year, and will do so via a new limited-time event, bringing with it new in-game decorations, a slew of limited cosmetic items, and brand new skins for its Resident Evil heroes Jill Valentine and Ada Wong.
The Resident Evil x LNY collection will give players the opportunity to bedeck Jill Valentine in her battlesuit, perhaps best remembered for its appearances in the Resident Evil Revelations series, while Ada Wong takes a trip back in time for her iconic split-legged cocktail dress and heels combo, which the sultry spy wore for her debut appearance in 1998&#x27;s Resident Evil 2, and is easily the most iconic of her looks to date.

Speaking of which, in addition to these new outfits, a new skin for killer &quot;The Blight&quot; will see it transform into the warped and tragic visage of Dr. William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist responsible for the creation of the devastating G-Virus, who ultimately succumbs to its own horrifying mutations. While most of the Lunar New Year cosmetics are time-limited, these three skins are permanent additions to the Dead by Daylight catalog.
Aside from the Resident Evil content, Dead by Daylight will also be celebrating the Lunar New Year with the new Moonlight Burrow event. This will see the realm decorated in creepy, rabbit-themed iconography, while affording players boosted Bloodpoints and themed rewards. Be sure to keep an eye out for the returning Red Envelopes, which will feature a variety of rare prizes and in-game bonuses. For full details on this new event, check out Behavior Interactive&#x27;s official blog... Or Look to la Luna.
Dead by Daylight: The Moonlight Burrow is now live on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>They&#x27;re heads down on Witchbrook
At this point I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Witchbrook is my most anticipated game of all time. I&#x27;ve been following its development for years at this point, and have become a regular lurker on the Witchbrook subreddit, which mostly exists to speculate about when the game will be coming out.  The title is basically a combination of Stardew Valley and the wizard school franchise that shall not be named, and as a fan of cozy simulation games, that&#x27;s a match made in heaven for me.
Today, the team at developer and publisher Chucklefish — who was also the original publisher of Stardew Valley — took to Twitter to let us know that yes, they&#x27;re still working on Witchbrook. They also made sure to emphasize in the thread that their in-house studio has a no-crunch policy, hence the long development time. Hey, if waiting a little while longer means no one is pushing themselves too hard trying to get the game out, I am perfectly happy to wait.
https://twitter.com/Witchbrook/status/1618646484601405441
The most recent update we got was in June of last year with some new screenshots and a Steam listing, and even that was the first news we had heard about the game in two years. We still don&#x27;t have any idea how far out Witchbrook really is, but thankfully I have some other cozy games like Disney&#x27;s Dreamlight Valley to tide me over for a while. If you&#x27;re interested in checking it out, you can wishlist the game on Steam and follow along on Chucklefish/Witchbrook&#x27;s socials to keep up with any more news that might be coming our way.

You gotta hand it to the Fallout 76 development team. Despite each new patch adding its own set of bugs, and the incredibly rocky launch, they&#x27;re still plugging away with updates. And sizeable ones, too! If there isn&#x27;t a major content patch in any given month, typically some other large update will go live to spruce things up: including this one for January 2023.
Live now on all platforms (including Steam, where the game shifted over to instead of the Bethesda Launcher), the patch has over 100 art and animation, audio, mechanical, and quality of life adjustments. One core focus is a weapon change that removes &quot;illegal attachment combinations that violate the EULA,&quot; which is an incredibly rough spot to be in! That fix (which impacted the PC community, and dealt with …</span>

As more and more studios actually release all the delayed projects from the past few years, Nintendo is sitting comfortably with just Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom alone. That will easily dominate the vast majority of May and beyond (years beyond, if Breath of the Wild is any indication), but there&#x27;s other stuff in tow, too.
Just this month, Nintendo sent out an email directly to folks to remind them of the upcoming 2023 slate. We&#x27;ve already seen a bit of it shake out in the form of two Persona ports and Fire Emblem Engage, and the rest really highlights how busy the next few months are going to be: just in the Nintendo space alone. While a few of them are ports and re-releases many multiplatform owners will still spring for the Switch edition, and there are ex…</span>

Things have been pretty crazy in the gaming sphere as of late (take your pick!): but there&#x27;s great news to report on the Destructoid front. Our owners — the GAMURS Group — are looking to expand the site and provide us with the tools we need to grow. As a result, we have a bigger freelance budget!

It&#x27;s finally time for GoldenEye 007 to come home to the Nintendo eShop. After months of waiting, Nintendo decided to drop GoldenEye 007 (also known as GoldenEye 64) on January 27: as part of the Switch Online Expansion Pack service.
While the jury is still out on whether or not the Expansion Pack premium upgrade will be remembered fondly long term, this is a great addition and one folks have been wanting for a long time (the best part is that it&#x27;s also on Xbox, so the love is being spread a bit). I&#x27;m sure anyone who grew up with the Nintendo 64 in their orbit spent at least one sleepover entirely playing this one.
There aren&#x27;t too many other big-ticket items this week, but OddBallers is out today, and SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake is due out on January 31. A few …</span>

It’s no secret that games are getting longer and bigger than they ever have been. “Hundreds of hours of content” is now a selling point for some of the biggest AAA titles, and as someone who’s already struggling to get through their backlog in a timely manner, huge, multi-week/month endeavors can sometimes be more overwhelming than they are exciting. Take God of War Ragnarok, for example. It’s not a game I really have the capacity to play right now, but my roommate, on the other hand, just finished a playthrough.
We’ve both worked in the industry for a while, so gaming is something of a communal activity in our house. Our shared PS5 is in the living room, so it’s common that we’ll sit together to watch the other one play the game du jour. I was …</span>

Pokémon GO takes player engagement to another level. Since its launch in 2016, players have been wowed by their favorite Pokémon seemingly all around them — all you need is a phone to see them and catch them. Years later, the mobile game keeps itself relevant by always adding new creatures to catch and plenty of events to get you out there. I talked about what Spotlight Hour is in Pokémon GO in a recent post where I mentioned that these one-hour events every Tuesday highlight one Pokémon, which is basically just a smaller, weekly Community Day. Well, the next Community Day coming our way is Sunday, February 5 from 2-5 PM, and it&#x27;s all about that Noibat.
Community Day is a three-hour long event that will highlight one Pokémon, making them more abundant i…</span>

It’s been 15 years since Dead Space first hit the Xbox 360, and a lot has happened since then. Survival horror and action games have evolved a lot in that timeframe. With the prospect of reviving a dormant but well-remembered franchise, EA Motive has quite a task.
For the most part, though, Motive has managed to revive the spirit while reimagining the container. The Dead Space remake frequently surprised me, both in how it put twists on familiar moments and still held true to the spirit of the original. Those fans who have been hoping for their limb-cutting, boot-stomping blend of action and body horror to arrive should be satisfied in Motive’s take on Dead Space.

A change of the seasons is usually a time for celebration. Whether you’re going from the dead cold of winter to the crisp dew of spring or leaving behind the dog days of summer for the kaleidoscope of autumn colors, the dawn of a coming season can bring with it fresh perspective and rejuvenation. At least, that’s what the changing of seasons is in our world. In SEASON: A letter to the future, seasons don’t necessarily abide by the calendar. People can’t assume they know when a season is going to end, but when it does, far more than just the temperature will change.

Developer CyberConnect 2 has announced a release date for its turn-based strategy sequel Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2, this highly dramatic tale of war will open fire on PC and console platforms from May 11.
Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 is the sequel to the tightly-held cult hit from 2021, and represents the fifth chapter of the Little Tail Bronx franchise, which details the trials and tribulations of an anthropomorphic cast of characters, waging war in a troubled steampunk universe. Melodies of Steel 2 will see the surviving crew members of the first title as they continue their journey through the battlefields of an alternate World War II — living out their lives in and around the aging battle tank, Taranis.

The original game was highly praised for its grim themes of loss, bravery, and sacrifice, portrayed by a cast of interesting characters and daubed in a fanciful art style. It is expected that Melodies of Steel 2 will retain the taut drama and never-say-die spirit of the original game, bolstered by improved and expanded combat mechanics, new characters, and hazardous new locales. One can likely assume that the powerful, all-consuming Soul Cannon will once again be ready to lock &#x27;n&#x27; load. Wanna draw straws?
Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 launches May 11 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. It will arrive on Xbox Game Pass on launch day. In addition, a Digital Deluxe Edition will feature a selection of bonus items, including a digital art book and soundtrack and a variety of alternate skins, in-game items, and a &quot;Dummy Soul&quot;, allowing for a single stay of execution when matters look bleakest.

                              <span>And all because the lady loves...
Nintendo has announced the next topic of discussion set to cause a helluva lot of mess in colorful arena shooter Splatoon 3 — Set to kick off on the weekend of February 11, the next Splatfest will ask squid kids and octolings everywhere to pick their favorite form of chocolate: Dark, Milk, or White.
As always each choice will be captained by one of our three lovable splatfest hosts, with Shiver representing Team Dark, Frye representing Team Milk, and Big Guy lumbered with absolutely-not-going-to-win Team White. Players can participate in a public vote for their team of choice before fighting it out for Clout Points in a weekend of super-sticky mayhem. Our hosts will then reveal the grand winner when the curtain falls on February 13. Who you got? Don&#x27;t bet on white. It&#x27;s not going to win.

I&#x27;m a Dark chocolate fan, myself, though that&#x27;s more of a medicinal thing — my stomach hates milk, y&#x27;see — but I can imagine this particularly sweet battle could be fairly heated. And it will also be interesting to see how global tastes differ from each other. To celebrate the announcement of this new splatfest, I&#x27;m probably going to eat some chocolate every day in the lead up to the event, and during, and then after.
We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a reminder when the big weekend approaches. Until then, take a look at the results for the last splatfest, which saw Frye bag her first-ever victory, after campaigning for Team Sweet.
Splatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>They later become the Doom Illuminati
The retro-inspired shooter genre is really in high gear. Following in the wake of the big-budget revival of Doom in 2016 and the indie hot flash of Dusk in 2018, there are now a tonne of indie games vying for recognition in the genre. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. It’s a favorite genre of mine, but it seems hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. My current approach is to just dump milk over all of them and dig in.
Dread Templar is in the bowl. Having entered Early Access back in August 2021, it’s finally time for it to get its 1.0 and get kicked out the door. I wasn’t quite sure what would make it stand out back in its initial test period, and now I’m even less sure.

                              <span>The Steam store page has also disappeared
Zombie survival MMO The Day Before was due to launch fairly soon. But now its developer Fntastic has pushed the launch back into November and delayed a gameplay showcase, citing concerns over the trademark of the name.
In a statement from the developer, Fntastic says that Steam has blocked The Day Before&#x27;s page at the request of a &quot;private individual&quot; because of the game&#x27;s name, The Day Before. Fntastic claims that sometime after The Day Before was announced, someone filed an application to register the trademark for The Day Before in the United States, linked here.
Fntastic and publisher Mytona claim they were not aware of this, and only found out on January 19, when they received a complaint from the trademark holder.

Update #2 : GoldenEye 007 is now live on the Nintendo Switch Online service and it seems there&#x27;s no need to worry. Sound the gong — everything sounds as it should!

Update : Digital Foundry’s John Linneman has stressed that while he &quot;doesn&#x27;t know&quot; the exact details, as speculated elsewhere, this could be down to emulation issues.

The latest Japanese charts are here and there are a couple of major changes to note this week.
First, looking at software, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have finally been knocked off the top spot by none other than Fire Emblem Engage, with the latter selling an impressive 144,558 copies. It&#x27;s a strong start for the tactical RPG, which also performed well in the UK, earning the second highest boxed launch of the entire franchise, just behind Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

Featuring both narrative driven storytelling and psychedelic musical &quot;rides&quot;, the game stars Zoe (a character from the original Road 96) and Kaito (from DigixArt&#x27;s debut title, Lost in Harmony) in the luxury community of White Sands, just prior to the events of the main game.

The online &#x27;mon battler Pokémon Unite has been consistently expanding its roster of fighters ever since its launch back in 2021 and this looks to continue into 2023. Comfey has today been announced as the year&#x27;s first addition and will be available in the game from 2nd February.
This news was shared by the @PokemonUnite Twitter account, though there was very little information given about the fighter itself, simply making the announcement that it is coming and providing the release date. Many of the other reveals have been accompanied by a fighter introduction video or some stats about their abilities, so perhaps we will learn more about the game&#x27;s freshest face in the coming days.

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake (THQ Nordic, 31st Jan, $39.99) - Wish-granting Mermaid’s Tears are in the hands of SpongeBob and Patrick. What could possibly go wrong? Sure, the very fabric holding the very universe very together could come very undone, opening portals into Wishworlds full of knights, cowboys, pirates and prehistoric snails.

With the closure of the 3DS eShop fast approaching, it&#x27;s got us feeling a little bit nostalgic here at Nintendo Life — particularly for games that we never got our hands on here in the West.
It&#x27;s a tale as old as time at this point. Many Japan-only games never get localised, and that&#x27;s been the case for a long time, but the 3DS has some truly special and unique titles that we&#x27;ve been begging for over the years. We&#x27;ve talked about Virtual Console games in Japan before, but now it&#x27;s time to look and pine after those that were available both on the shelves and on the eShop, but that we were never lucky enough to see get an official English release.

In a recent interview with Nintenderos, Vanillaware president George Kamitani admitted that he wants to bring Wii Metroidvania Muramasa: The Demon Blade to modern consoles one day. However, there are things stopping it.
Vanillaware has been on a bit of a roll lately with Switch ports. In 2022, the critically acclaimed sci-fi adventure game 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim got a near-flawless port on the console, and in a few months&#x27; time, PS2 RTS GrimGrimoire is getting an enhanced rerelease called GrimGrimoire OnceMore. And while Kamitani wants the beautiful Edo Japan-set Metroidvania to join those two titles (Odin Sphere and Dragon&#x27;s Crown have both also received ports on other consoles), it&#x27;s not so easy.

The &#x27;Maxwell Character Update&#x27; brings the game up to ver.1.4.0 and adds in a whole new &quot;Encore&quot; storyline to the game alongside the titular character.
This addition comes in amongst a fair few tweaks and changes to help improve the play experience. The patch notes were shared by the developers on a recent blog post and you can check them out in full below:

                              <span>Cuddly on the surface.
CyberConnect2 has revealed that it&#x27;s bringing the surprise sequel to its hit RPG Fuga: Melodies of Steel to Switch on 11th May 2023 (thanks Gematsu!). Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2, and its predecessor, are part of the Little Tail Bronx series, and both games act as prequels to the PS1 game Tail Concerto and its DS spiritual successor, Solatorobo: Red the Hunter.
Fuga: Melodies of Steel traded the previous games&#x27; action-based combat for an on-rails turn-based take on strategy RPGs. The sequel uses the same system and looks to build on the same emotive story that the first game employed.

Well folks, Splatoon 3&#x27;s next Splatfest is set and it looks like this is going to be another tasty one. After asking us to choose between taste sensations last time around, the next competition is about to get a whole lot more personal as we are going to have to pick sides on a much bigger debate: &quot;What&#x27;s your favourite chocolate?&quot;
Shared via @NintendoEurope, this theme will be giving us the options of Team Dark Chocolate, Team Milk Chocolate and Team White Chocolate, with the three factions battling it out for sweet supremacy in Turf War Battles from the 11th-13th February.

Na konci roku 2022 bylo evidováno celkem 1 463 116 domén. Průměrně bylo měsíčně zaregistrováno 17 193 domén, přičemž nejvíce registrací proběhlo v listopadu (23 581) a nejméně pak v červenci (13 199). Na rozdíl od předchozích let byl poprvé v historii zaznamenán propad v počtu domén zabezpečených technologií DNSSEC, který klesl o 1,77 procenta na celkových 844 615; tato skutečnost souvisí především se změnou politiky na straně jednoho z velkých registrátorů.</span>

Like a necromorph reanimating the dead, Motive Studios has revived Dead Space and made it stronger and more terrifying than before. This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…</span>

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us this morning on Twitch at 10 a.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Sega has announced that “The Cleaner” will assist players as one of the game’s many Trooper cards.
The centerpiece mechanic of Ishin, these cards grant special attacks and bonuses thanks to the help of several fan-favorite characters, including the likes of Ichiban Kasuga. Omega’s card, aptly named Essence of the One-Winged Angel after his Final Fantasy-inspired finishing move, can slice foes with a powerful, wide-reaching attack using his angel wing. 
To learn more about the announcement, I sat down with Omega to chat about his Trooper card’s origins, his long-standing love of the series formerly known as Yak…</span>

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>Last summer, Turn 10 Studios and Xbox announced a new entry in the esteemed Forza Motorsport series, built from the ground up for Xbox Series X/S. The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry &quot;a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series.&quot; For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

                              <span>During Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer_Direct live stream, Tango Gameworks surprise announced its next title, Hi-Fi Rush. And if you know anything about the studio&#x27;s previous games, it&#x27;s a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. 
Hi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games&#x27; Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango&#x27;s other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year&#x27;s Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. 
Check out the trailer below:


Hi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It&#x27;s directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we learned a ton of new information about Minecraft Legends, Mojang&#x27;s latest Minecraft spin-off. In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.


If you&#x27;re unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. 
In the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team&#x27;s base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.
A blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.</span>

Revealed during today’s Xbox Developer Direct, a new games showcase event from the company, The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom brings players to eastern Morrowind, a location studio head Matt Firor says hasn&#x27;t been in an Elder Scrolls game since 1994. 


Players will encounter Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince last seen in the Dragonborn DLC for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in Necrom. Firor also revealed that Necrom will add the Arcanist class to the MMO, which allows players to channel different types of magic, like destructive, restorative, and defensive magic.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed back in September that the classic N64 game, GoldenEye 007, was coming to Switch, complete with online play. Microsoft announced that same day that GoldenEye 007 was coming to Xbox as well, although this version of the famed game would not feature online multiplayer like its Switch counterpart. 
Neither announcement included a release date, but today, developer Rare revealed that GoldenEye 007 launches this week, on Friday, January 27. The Switch version will be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack memberships, but you can purchase GoldenEye 007 individually on Xbox and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass as well.


Interestingly, the Xbox version, despite not featuring online functionality, will include improved control options (like dual analog stick support), native 16:9 resolution up to 4K Ultra HD, a consistent refresh rate, and full achievement support. 
If you own Rare Replay on Xbox, you will gain access to GoldenEye 007 for free.
&quot;Enter a world of espionage as Bond in GoldenEye 007,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Your covert operation to stop the GoldenEye weapon satellite spans the globe – you&#x27;ll infiltrate underground bases, charge through a military train, and slink around the depths of a jungle. Along the way, M will brief you on your objectives and Q Branch will support your efforts with an array of gadgets, but the ultimate success of this mission is yours alone.&quot;

Microsoft released its second quarter financial results for the 2023 fiscal year yesterday, and it revealed that Xbox gaming revenue declined 13% overall. Xbox content and services, such as first-party software and monetization in third-party games, declined 12%, but Microsoft notes that this decline is up against a &quot;strong prior year comparable.&quot; Given that Xbox&#x27;s 2022 was lackluster compared to the prior year, this isn&#x27;t surprising.
However, the financial results state that this 12% decline is &quot;partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.&quot; Xbox hardware revenue has also declined 13%. During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Xbox&#x27;s monthly act…</span>

                              <span>Justin Roiland has resigned from Squanch Games following domestic abuse charges. 
The High On Life Twitter account released a statement yesterday, revealing that the studio received Roiland&#x27;s resignation on January 16. Squanch says it will &quot;keep developing games we know our fans will love while continuing to support and improve High On Life.&quot;

This statement came just a couple of hours after the official Rick and Morty Twitter account posted a statement revealing that Adult Swim has ended its association with Roiland. However, Rick and Morty will continue and the current talent and crew is currently working on Season 7. 
The titular charcters of the show will be recast as Roiland provided the voice for both of them.

All of this comes after news broke on January 12 that Roiland had been charged with domestic violence charges in Orange County, California, in relation to an alleged 2020 incident. As reported by The Hollywood Reporter, a May 2020 felony complaint reveals Roiland has been charged with one count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud or deceit. The complaint says these charges come from a Jane Doe &quot;who was in a dating relationship with the defendant.&quot; 
Roiland pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond in August 2020. During a pre-trial hearing that happened earlier this month, Roiland&#x27;s attorney said Roiland heard a plea offer, but not other details regarding it or whether Roiland was taking it have been revealed. 
Squanch Games was co-founded by Roiland in 2016 and in its tenure thus far has developed Accounting+, PlayStation VR game Trover Saves The Universe, and last year&#x27;s High On Life.</span>

Pokémon is owned by a number of companies, leading to a complicated relationship for the valuable brand and its parents. When asked if he could explain the relationship between Game Freak, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company, while visiting Game Freak in 2017, co-founder Junichi Masuda turned to a white board behind him to draw out his explanation.
After drawing circles for Game Freak, Nintendo, and former producer Creatures, Masuda explained. “Game Freak? We develop all the main Pokémon games. Originally, Creatures, they were the producers of the game. Nintendo was the seller of the games – the distributor. So that was the original structure of Pokémon games. In terms of who owns the rights to the games, it’s these three companies.”

                              <span>Xbox&#x27;s spring plans are set in motion
The curtains have closed on Xbox and Bethesda&#x27;s Developer Direct. The roughly 45-minute showcase spotlighted a taste of the year ahead for Xbox studios, running the gamut from updates on big launches to an out-now surprise.
It was, I think, a pretty solid showcase. Direct and to-the-point, the studios under Microsoft&#x27;s banner showed off just what&#x27;s in store in the coming months and year. Granted, this isn&#x27;t all that Xbox has in store; we didn&#x27;t see Starfield, though we knew we wouldn&#x27;t going in.
This felt like a nice check-in for the new year. A few games finally locked in their release dates, the Forza team at Turn10 got to show off their rad tech, and Tango Gameworks dropped a surprise. Here&#x27;s the rundown.

Disney&#x27;s Dreamlight Valley has taken over my free time. I was looking for a cozy new simulator to play, and so far this title has ticked all the boxes for me. I found it to be a bummer that I was nearing the end of all of the content released as of now, so I was waiting with bated breath to hear any news about what&#x27;s to come. My prayers have finally been answered, because Gameloft just laid out their plans for their free updates in 2023, as reported by GameSpot. This year has a ton in store for the game, including a multiplayer mode, new characters, realms, clothing, motifs, decorations, and furniture.
First up in February, the game will be welcoming two new villagers: Mirabel from Encanto and Olaf from Frozen. We&#x27;ll also be able to &quot;d…</span>

                              <span>Take a bite out of this spooky adventure later this spring
With previous releases like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, Arkane has one of the most solid track records out there. Fans have been anxiously awaiting their newest release, vampire FPS Redfall. The game will feature a roster of playable characters who all utilize unique abilities to take down the vampires that are terrorizing the isolated town of Redfall. We got an in-depth look at what to expect from the gameplay during today&#x27;s Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, including character skill trees, a whole host of weapons and gadgets, and encounters that players will come across in the game&#x27;s &quot;immersive open world.&quot; The most exciting news of all, though, is the official release date for Redfall, which the developers from Arkane announced as May 2, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cR8GVePOdpY
From where I stand, Redfall really looks like a culmination of everything Arkane has created so far, such as the studio&#x27;s focus on complex problem-solving with multiple ways to approach any given situation, allowing players to truly craft their build around how they want to play with different items and skill trees, and of course their endlessly-compelling means of storytelling through complex characters and environments. I&#x27;m greatly looking forward to giving Redfall a go, especially with friends along the way to further enjoy the spooky atmosphere and dynamic gameplay encounters.

                              <span>Feel the rush
Tango Gameworks has something a bit different in store for its next game. Hi-Fi Rush is a musical rhythm-focused action game, coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S consoles today.
Revealed during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, everything in Hi-Fi Rush is connected to the beat. The whole world, from its action and combos to the traps and scenery, moves to the rhythm.
Playing as Chai, a &quot;defect&quot; who can detect the rhythm of the world, you team up with pals to take on your enemies. It&#x27;s got a vibe similar to something like Sunset Overdrive, and I&#x27;m very much down for it.
https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1618344785357447221
The team wants it to be playable for those who aren&#x27;t so rhytmically inclined too, though. Chai&#x27;s cat, the appropriately named 808, can keep the beat for you as a little helper drone. And a marker at the bottom of the screen can also track the BPM for you.
While Tango Gameworks may be known for series like The Evil Within or the more recent Ghostwire: Tokyo, which falls more into the dark and scary, Hi-Fi Rush is a bit of a departure. And the added surprise, revealed during the show, is that it goes live tonight. Being an Xbox studio game, too, it&#x27;s also part of Xbox Game Pass.

One of the best non-mechs I&#x27;ve tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it&#x27;s down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

                              <span>Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game, which means you view the world from above and command armies of mobs. But there&#x27;s still plenty that&#x27;s familiar from traditional Minecraft, if tonight&#x27;s presentation during the Xbox developer showcase is any indication.

They also announced a release date: April 18th.

                              <span>Beijing-based outfit Edifier have been making some of the best value computer speakers for a while now; in fact my roundup over at Digital Foundry dedicates two of the seven slots to their designs. One that doesn&#x27;t feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they&#x27;ve ever been before.

For example: Redfall, the open world co-op vampire shooter from Arkane, now has a release date. You&#x27;ll be able to find out exactly how much like Far Cry it is on May 2nd.

                              <span>So those Tango Gameworks leaks turned out to be true. After repeatedly stating that this evening&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It&#x27;s a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there&#x27;s an even bigger surprse.

The bigger surprise is it&#x27;s out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.

                              <span>The original Pharaoh, released in 1999, was a lot of people&#x27;s first citybuilder. In part because it was exactly the kind of game that could be found in the software section of your local supermarket, and in part because it appealed to dads, who would buy it and then their bored kids would play it in lieu of any other options.

Well, I&#x27;m the dad now, and the &quot;full remake&quot; Pharaoh: A New Era has a release date of February 15th.

                              <span>A fast-paced game that&#x27;s all about reflecting bullets back with a katana sounds great to me, a known fan of parrying projectiles. I bought new indie game Agent In Depth within 20 seconds of seeing it. Then I played it. Oh no. I feel old. Am I too old? What I can tell you is, if you like fast-paced action platformers with bullets to parry, instadeath to punish you, and no checkpoints to support you, you might enjoy this. It&#x27;s only £2 to find out.

                              <span>Last time, you decided overwhelmingly (94%!) that knocking folks over edges is better than big engines rising from the bonnet. Honestly, I cannot disagree. I adore that giant supercharged engine. I will always pick the cars with that giant supercharged engine. But imagine if someone were standing atop that giant supercharged engine&#x27;s towering intake, and I kicked them off it. Glorious! This week, I must apologise, but circumstances have led us to a choice between two wholly dissimilar things. What&#x27;s better: a pre-boss battle supply cache, or resources too good to use?

                              <span>Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. 


These aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a fan of a rhythm game. Something where you can get into a flow state, you know? They can be perfect when you&#x27;ve had a long day and don&#x27;t want to engage brain. The thing is, I don&#x27;t think Thumper is one of those games. Thumper is some kind of sci-fi nightmare in space, and it moves so fast that you can&#x27;t relax for a second.

                              <span>Sneaky new photos taken of the set of Amazon’s Fallout TV adaptation have been shared on Twitter that show one of the retro-futuristic series’ Red Rocket gas stations being built. While the chain’s distinctive rocket doesn’t feature in any of the snaps, all taken by J. Carson in New York state, you can clearly make out the Red Rocket branding on its sign and bright red atomic fuel pumps. The whole look is very post-apocalyptic, dilapidated with beaten up 1950s-style American cars parked around the forecourt.

Actor Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last Of Us show alongside Pedro Pascal as Joel, told the BBC that she reckons Season 2 is “pretty likely”. Quickly covering herself – and preventing an online outbreak reminiscent of a scene from the show and/or game – Ramsey stressed that the show being renewed was still a decision for the suits at HBO. “There&#x27;s nothing confirmed yet so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see,” she said.

                              <span>Source code for fantasy MOBA League Of Legends and its autobattler spin-off Teamfight Tactics has been stolen and ransomed, Riot Games have confirmed. In a series of tweets, the developer revealed that the code was taken in an attack on their systems last week. Demands have been made by the hackers, which Riot say they won’t stump up for. The hack is being investigated both by Riot and law enforcement agencies, but Riot insist that League Of Legends players’ personal data and information weren’t compromised by the hackers.

                              <span>I was absolutely elated when Square Enix announced a new Final Fantasy Theatrhythm game during the Tokyo Game Show last year, as there&#x27;s been a Final Fantasy music game shaped hole in my life for the best part of a decade. I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix&#x27;s newfound PC love-in would mean I&#x27;d be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn&#x27;t, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that&#x27;s okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII&#x27;s Those Who Fight Further. Come and have a listen.

                              <span>Expected to be squared away in time for the Linux 6.3 kernel cycle, which is kicking off in February, is Automatic IBRS as a new feature of Zen 4 processors. The patches already have been queued up into TIP&#x27;s x86/cpu branch so barring any issues will be all wired up for this next kernel version. Automatic IBRS can provide better performance than the Retpolines implementation used currently on Zen 4 and prior CPUs as part of the Spectre V2 mitigations. With the switch over to Automatic IBRS for Zen 4, it means better performance in some areas as shown by these benchmarks today with AMD 4th Gen EPYC &quot;Genoa&quot; processors.</span>

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM.

Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.

I&#x27;m justifying this spurious comparison because the games we picked as our favourites of 2022 have proven a strong indicator of what you&#x27;ll find on this year&#x27;s list of IGF finalists. Among the selectees are Tunic, Betrayal At Club Low, Norco, Neon White and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>While we spend a lot of our time over here in the deals corner of RPS covering high-speed NVMe SSDs, I also try to keep an eye out for good deals on classic 2.5-inch SATA SSDs as well. These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. 
Today&#x27;s example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That&#x27;s an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD.

As a kid, we would refer to it simply as “The Banana Game”. I had to rely on my Dad to play it, as only he was able to access an unfathomable portal called “DOS”, summoning it out of the inky void using long strings of seemingly random letters; an incantation that gave it a sort of mystical allure.

Rockstar Support have tweeted that a security-related update is coming, but didn&#x27;t give a specific timeframe for it yet.

                              <span>Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the &#x27;touch anything and you&#x27;re dead&#x27; bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you&#x27;d also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you&#x27;ll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs.

                              <span>Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it&#x27;s such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could &quot;live the book&quot;. Don&#x27;t bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.
This made me think about, firstly, that we&#x27;d be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they&#x27;re achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t want to live in any of the books he&#x27;s been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn&#x27;t want to be in them because you&#x27;d only end up being a side character, and that&#x27;s boring.

                              <span>There’s a new Nvidia GeForce Game Ready Driver out, and for once it sounds pretty interesting – especially if you’re lucky/rich/unhinged enough to have dropped megabucks on one of Nvidia’s megabucks RTX 40 series GPUs.


The 528.24 WHQL driver is mainly aimed at tuning up GeForce graphics cards for imminent PC releases Forspoken, the Dead Space remake, and Deliver Us Mars. All three will include DLSS support, which might come in handy for Forspoken in particular, given its slightly bananas system requirements. But 528.24 will also get Hitman 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns ready for DLSS 3 upgrades, with both games set to gain support for the overhauled upscaler in forthcoming patches.

                              <span>Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you&#x27;re given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it&#x27;s your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn&#x27;t most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you&#x27;re tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you&#x27;ll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they&#x27;re all swept away. 
It&#x27;s certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi&#x27;s undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio&#x27;s debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they&#x27;re tipped in your favour.

                              <span>Mimimi Games have been teasing their next stealth strategy game for over two years now, and finally, we know what it is. Today, the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun revealed that the game formerly known as Codename: Sweet Potato (or Süßkartoffel, in their native German) is now called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, and it&#x27;s all about undead magical pirates. Sign me the heck up.
I got to see Shadow Gambit in action late last week, and boy howdy it looks super cool. Even better, it&#x27;s coming to Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. Read on below to watch its pair of exciting reveal trailers, and find out all about it.

                              <span>After almost 14 years, I am still delighted by Windosill. It&#x27;s still a joy to poke and prod at the wee indie puzzle game, tugging on orbs, spinning carousels, and jabbing at the many beaks and eyeballs and mouths and noises emerging from an ever-shifting box. It&#x27;s such a reward for curiosity. And it still looks great too, with that unaging smooth vector art from developer Vectorpark. Now it&#x27;s out on Android phones and tablets too. I bought it, and really enjoy how much a touchscreen adds to the tactile experience.

Created by Half-Life 2: VR Mod’s SourceVR Mod Team, Episode One is the first of Valve’s episodic adventures to get the virtual reality overhaul treatment. It’s planned to follow up with Episode Two at an unannounced, but at a later date. You can take a gander at Half-Life 2: VR Mod - Episode One in full flow below, without wearing the fancy digital helmet.

                              <span>It’s only been a week since Microsoft announced they were laying off 10,000 human staff across their various divisions (including their games studios), but they&#x27;ve now revealed they’ll be investing billions of dollars into driving breakthroughs in AI. Microsoft will be pumping the money into futuristic tech firm OpenAI, which operates Turing-botherer chatbot ChatGPT and its artistic relative DALL-E. OpenAI’s already received two investments from Microsoft, one in 2019 and another in 2021. This third investment is intended to be “multi-year” and “multibillion dollar”, allowing both companies to “independently commercialize” whatever budding Skynets emerge.

                              <span>Even before the monsters arrived, the USG Ishimura was a nightmare. 


I mean, yes, the hulking spaceship where Dead Space takes place isn’t exactly a floating Hilton once its crew have been turned inside out by a bunch of drooling flesh moths, but there is ample evidence that the Ishimura was a miserable place to live and work long before that happened. This is why the planet cracker class vessel is still remembered as fondly as other iconic spaces such as City 17, Rapture and the Spencer Mansion. Despite its fantastical contexts, the Ishimura is a believable location, one where the work itself is deemed more important than the workers who do it.

                              <span>You may have already heard that several outlets haven&#x27;t had review code for Forspoken, Squeenix&#x27;s magical parkour isekai game that&#x27;s out today and that some people have already decided they hate because of the dialogue. I was actually pretty excited to review the game, and was hopeful that the dialogue would make sense and work in context. But unfortunately we, too, are one of the outlets who don&#x27;t have code, so no PC review from us for a while.
Like many others - and you too, if you&#x27;ve got a PS5 - I&#x27;ve been able to play the free Forspoken demo, which plops you into the game after the opening bumf, and presumably the cutscene where Frey establishes her modern girl &quot;lemme get this straight?!&quot; credentials. And you know what? I don&#x27;t hate it!

Z čehož vyplývá, že je potřeba ohlídat si nastavení KDF na straně klienta, protože dostatečně vysoký počet iterací hraje významnou roli ve zpomalení útočníka snažícího se uhádnout hlavní heslo trezoru.</span>

                              <span>Last week, The Last of Us&#x27; premiere scored HBO&#x27;s second largest debut for an original series since 2010. And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, &quot;Infected,&quot; has broken another HBO record.
&quot;Infected&quot; brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week&#x27;s 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network&#x27;s history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the &quot;largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,&quot; which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. 
Weirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. 
Episode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>EA Motive&#x27;s remake of Dead Space is out later this week, but if you need your fix of Isaac Clarke now, you can purchase the Strange Transmissions Quest Pack in Fortnite today. 
Isaac Clarke joins Fortnite&#x27;s Gaming Legends Series and he can join your locker roster via the new quest pack for $11.99. Strange Transmissions is available now in the Fortnite Item Shop and it allows you to collect the Issac Clarke Outfit and earn up to 1500 V-Bucks, which is essentially how much the pack costs (if you convert V-Bucks into real-world dollars). The pack also includes the RIG Back Bling, the USG Ishimura Back Bling, the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe, and the Bench Upgrade Emote, which is built-in to the Plasma Cutter Pickaxe. 
For more Isaac Clarke, watch this extended Dead Space gameplay walkthrough that runs down the remake&#x27;s new features and then watch this new story trailer for Dead Space ahead of the game&#x27;s release this Friday. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s big list of upcoming video game remakes after that.

Revealed yesterday during a Thunderful stream, SteamWorld Build is a new city-builder set in the SteamWorld universe due out sometime this year on consoles and PC. In it, your goal is to escape a dying planet and the only way to do this is by building a mining town to dig up &quot;vital long-lost technology.&quot; You&#x27;ll need to manage your city as the needs of it, and the citizens living there, grow, and you&#x27;ll have to defend your creation from the deadly creatures that lurk below.

The Taiwanese company is probably better known for its desktop PCs - or its former StarCraft II team! - but they&#x27;re also a solid choice when it comes to high performance, relatively good value monitors - without the RGB and heavy branding of competitors like Asus or MSI. 
In any case, one of Acer&#x27;s most popular models, the Nitro XF243Y Pbmiiprx, is down to £120 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a great price for a 24-in 1080p 165Hz monitor that has attracted strongly positive reviews.

                              <span>As DDR4 RAM prices continue to fall, we&#x27;re starting to see even 32GB kits become affordable - great news for content creators or anyone that wants to somewhat &#x27;future-proof&#x27; their system. Case in point is this dual-channel 32GB kit from Kingston, with a 3200MT/s CL16 spec that sits just at the sweet spot for price versus performance.

                              <span>After four years away, SteamWorld is back. If you haven&#x27;t seen the news yet, Thunderful unveiled SteamWorld Build earlier this evening, the next entry in their genre-hopping series of games about colourful robot pals trying to make their way in the world. As the name implies, this one&#x27;s a citybuilder, and I&#x27;ve been hands on with an early build of, err, Build, to tell you all about it. No, I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s Build that&#x27;s coming out first. 
After all, it&#x27;s been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That&#x27;s right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it&#x27;s a mining and tower defence &#x27;em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it&#x27;s really something special.

                              <span>Thunderful have just unveiled the next game in their excellent SteamWorld series, and it&#x27;s not the one we thought it was going to be. Third person action co-op adventure SteamWorld Headhunter was initially teased in November 2021, but Thunderful used their SteamWorld Telegraph: Special Broadcast this evening to talk about a very different kind of new SteamWorld game - and it looks rad as heck. It&#x27;s a citybuilder, and (appropriately) it&#x27;s called SteamWorld Build. I&#x27;ve played a bit of it already, and you can read more of my thoughts about it right here. Spoiler alert: it&#x27;s a little bit good. If you just want the facts of what was announced, though, read on below.

With the Joy Of Painting mod, you can set up your field easel anywhere in Morrowind, daub some brush strokes on a canvas, and even flog the painting to earn a bit of cash.

So rather than go into detail here about the original game itself (although if you want to hear more about it, I&#x27;ve got something pretty cool in the pipeline for you, so watch this space!), I&#x27;ve decided to use this HYP to talk about the brilliant TV adverts that first brought it to my attention.

Over the weekend, devs Infinity Ward tweeted about Hardcore mode’s imminent comeback in the forthcoming update. Hardcore mode chucks out the game’s HUD, turns on friendly fire, and reduces health to make matches quicker and a little more unpredictable. There&#x27;ll also be some changes to Warzone 2’s DMZ, such as new missions and difficulty tuning.

                              <span>It’s not even out yet, but we already know that the Dead Space remake launching on January 27th will have an alternate ending. A list of the game’s achievements published on True Trophies includes one that hints at another way to see out the revised adventures of Isaac Clarke, instead of just landing the bog-standard ending. Thankfully, there’s not much more info beyond its existence, so at least the extra ending isn’t ruined and you’ll be able to find out what it means for yourself.

Rockstar-focused Twitter account Tez2 highlighted the issue at the end of last week, before news of the situation spread onto the GTA Online subreddit. Rockstar Support hasn’t officially acknowledged any potential the exploits have to affect GTA Online players and their accounts, although Tez2 claimed that the company were already aware of what was going on.

PlayStation revealed 11 new PlayStation VR2 games back in November, including a new entry in Supermassive Games&#x27; The Dark Pictures anthology series called Switchback VR. Supermassive released Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, a PlayStation VR rail shooter, in 2016, and Switchback VR is its spiritual successor. When Switchback VR was revealed late last year, there wasn&#x27;t an official release date attached to it – PlayStation just referred to it as a PSVR2 launch window title. 
Nonetheless, Supermassive Games will release Switchback VR later than expected, as it has been delayed to March 16. It&#x27;s a short delay, given that PSVR2 launches on February 22, and any game in its launch window was likely due around then. As for why, Supermassive Games says…</span>

                              <span>Life Is Strange 2 is coming to Switch in just a couple of weeks. 
The 2019 episodic adventure game will arrive in its entirety on February 2. The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. 


This news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.
In our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that &quot;Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.&quot; What&#x27;s your favorite Life Is Strange game?

                              <span>World War Z is no stranger to having lots and lots of zombies, but a new mode launching tomorrow somehow stuffs even more undead into the experience with Horde Mode XL. Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.
Horde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can read our review of World War Z right here.</span>

Forspoken is a game about movement and running. Protagonist Frey begins the game running from the law and debt collectors. She&#x27;s also in the middle of a plan to flee New York City with a gym bag full of cash. Amidst that chaos, she falls into the land of Athia and is eager to leave the new, mysterious world where she inexplicably has superhuman combat and running abilities. Getting from one place to another is Forspoken’s high point, and while no other element quite reaches the heights of how fun running and climbing are, Frey’s adventure isn’t without its highlights.

                              <span>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. 
Microsoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company&#x27;s ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there&#x27;s no official indication that Halo Infinite&#x27;s course is changing following these layoffs. 
Still, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: 
pic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59
January 21, 2023
It&#x27;s a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite.

As for features, so far, the biggest new addition is WarGames match type (WWE&#x27;s version). The dual-ring, double cage match can be played 3v3 or 4v4 single-player or online. 2K also teases a “unique new take” on the documentary style 2K Showcase mode, which of course, highlights Cena&#x27;s career. MyGM returns in an expanded form, MyFaction is getting online multiplayer, and the story-driven MyRise, Universe, and Creation modes are back.

                              <span>Since the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, players have asked for a Hardcore Mode, which was notably absent from the game at launch and still today. Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. 
This news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it&#x27;s been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it&#x27;s clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. 
No HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!
January 22, 2023
Infinity Ward&#x27;s tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if &quot;no HUD&quot; is any indication, it&#x27;ll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. 
While waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

Ve třetím čtvrtletí loňského roku došlo k rozdělení pozic přibližně rovnoměrně mezi Spojené státy a Indii, s přelomem roku se úplně celý vývoj přesunul do Asie.</span>

                              <span>343 Industries &quot;will continue to develop Halo now and in the future,&quot; says studio head Pierre Hintze. The statement was released in response to rumours that 343 would instead take a backseat on future Halo games by serving to manage external studios, rather than developing the games themselves as they had on Halo Infinite.

                              <span>The original Granblue Fantasy was a JRPG mobile game only released in Japan, but that didn&#x27;t stop enterprising westerners going to the effort to play it. That&#x27;s mainly because it counted Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba among its developers.

Granblue Fantasy: Relink is set in the same universe and has the same Final Fantasy vets involved, but it&#x27;s a big, splashly 1-4 player action RPG blockbuster, with combat reminiscent of some Platinum Games. You&#x27;ll find the latest trailer below.

Players who already own the game at that point will be able to continue playing in single- and multiplayer, for at least a while.

The boiler is gone in my house, so I&#x27;m wearing one of those giant hoodie things that comes down to my knees, and scuttle about the place secreting foodstuffs in the pouch. Wait, that&#x27;s more like a kangaroo, isn&#x27;t it. Curses! Regardless, I will only be able to warm my hands this weekend by cupping them over the light of my PC screen. What will I, and others, be playing on them this weekend?

The Internet infrastructure company clearly stands out and should do more to address the issue, the report suggests. Banning domains that are removed or demoted by Google could be a good start, Corsearch notes.

The 2.7 update, which arrived November 30, 2022, adding Winter Soldier and the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat, was the final new content for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers. Crystal Dynamics has planned one final title update, version 2.8, to arrive on March 31, 2023. This update will not add any new content (including no additional cosmetics).

Well, anyway, Haven Park is like A Short Hike crossed with Animal Crossing, and it&#x27;s currently free to keep from GOG.

                              <span>With all the Sad Dad™ games that have cropped up in recent years, many have rightfully been asking: &quot;Where are all the video game mums at?&quot;. Well, what if I told you that Swedish indie studio Might and Delight have been putting mums at the centre of their games since 2013? Yup, elephant mums in Shelter 3, Lynx mums in Shelter 2, and the OG badass badger mum in Shelter 1. Sure it’s kinda terrible that the only major rep mums are getting in video games is in the form of Might and Delight’s animal tales, but I’ll honestly take any story about motherhood I can get my paws on.
As much as I love Shelter 2 (less so Shelter 3, unfortunately), Shelter 1 holds a special place in my heart, mostly because no other animal-focused survival game has come even remotely close to claiming the coveted title of &quot;most brutal animal sim that made me ugly cry.&quot;

                              <span>Devs Massive Monster have revealed that sweetly macabre roguelite management sim Cult Of The Lamb is getting its Relics Of The Old Faith update soon, followed by a second big update towards the middle of the year. Both are free, although there’s not a suitably intimidating cult-related name for the latter yet. Relics Of The Old Faith was shown off a bit at the end of 2022, but this is the first we’re hearing of another arriving later in this sparkly new year.

To date, Hollywood hasn&#x27;t been able to take the site down but could it be damaged by relentless DMCA notices and domain changes?

The pair chat with Kyle Hilliard about the first two episodes of HBO&#x27;s The Last Of Us series and share their initial reactions to the show. Unfortunately, the video game industry was subject to massive layoffs this week, with reports of large companies like Microsoft, 343 Industries, and Bethesda reducing their workforce by over 10,000 employees. At the same time, on the media side, our talented peers at Giant Bomb, GameSpot, and Fandom were also affected. 
During The Playlist, the crew chats about recent games they&#x27;ve been playing, including Tchia, PlateUp!, Pentiment, and The Case Of The Golden Idol.

                              <span>We concluded 2022 by returning to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

Blocking measures are already cemented in law, but the new agreement establishes &#x27;good practices&#x27; while also addressing costs. The ISPs, meanwhile, call on search engines and hosting companies to follow suit.

According to the counternotice, the police don&#x27;t seem to understand how the site works.

                              <span>As announced in a recent blog post, 13 new games are coming to PlayStation VR2, and they’re all expected to release “within one month of the February 22 launch.” They are as follows:
Before Your Eyes
Kayak VR: Mirage
Pavlov VR
Puzzling Places
Song in the Smoke: Rekindled
Synth Riders: Remastered Edition
Thumper
NFL Pro Era
What the Bat?
Rez Infinite
Tetris Effect
Creed Rise to Glory: Championship Edition
The Last Clockwinder
The blog post also mentions that Gran Turismo 7 will receive a free VR2 update on launch day. A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.
This list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.
PlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today. A few months ago, we learned that the base model will cost $549.99, with the option to bundle it with Horizon Call the Mountain for an additional $50.

EA Sports has been producing officially licensed PGA Tour video games since 1990, with stars like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy lending their names to the product over the years. However, the company has not released a PGA Tour video game since 2015, meaning other franchises have had time to slide into the space once occupied by EA Sports’ mainstay series.
However, EA Sports is ready to make up for lost time with its newest title. The emphasis this time around is on realism, not only with how the players and courses look but also in how players must approach every hol…</span>

                              <span>A Ubisoft game known as Project Q leaked early last year before the Assassin&#x27;s Creed maker revealed its existence, calling it a team-based battle arena combat game. 
Insider Gaming reported yesterday that Ubisoft had canceled Project Q and now, Ubisoft has confirmed that this is, in fact, true to Video Games Chronicle. 
&quot;We can confirm we will no longer support the development of Project Q in order to focus on priority projects, to which our teams are being reallocated,&quot; Ubisoft told VGC. 
This cancelation comes after Ubisoft delayed Skull and Bones last week alongside news that it had canceled three unannounced games. It&#x27;s currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced). 
For more, read about what Project Q was going to be here.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet arrived on Switch last November, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game is ready to leave Galar for the open world of Paldea. That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.
Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.
Though I&#x27;m frustrated you can&#x27;t buy these as individual booster packs (they&#x27;re only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I&#x27;m very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword &amp; Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!</span>

The company hasn&#x27;t revealed exact numbers and specific departments regarding the layoffs yet, but some employees at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work getting Starfield ready for its release this year, were laid off. According to a Bloomberg report, though, Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest by the layoffs. Again, neither Microsoft nor 343 Industries has revealed an exact number but based on industry discussion online, it seems like the studio lost quite a lot of people.

                              <span>Microsoft has laid off 10,000 employees. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report detailing that Microsoft&#x27;s layoff come as the company attempts to reduce costs amid a larger economic slowdown. These layoffs come amidst Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing fight against the FTC to acquire Call of Duty makers Activision Blizzard for a staggering $69 billion. Bloomberg reports that some people at Bethesda Game Studios, which is hard at work on getting Starfield ready for its release sometime in the first half of this year, were laid off, but that Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries was hit hardest in the company&#x27;s portfolio of game studios. 
According to Bloomberg, Microsoft has plans to hire in &quot;strategic, competitive areas&quot; like AI but that other tech-focused departments like HoloLens and some engineering divisions were hit by these layoffs. 
Microsoft has not yet revealed exact numbers and specific departments surrounding this massive wave of layoffs. Another tech giant, Amazon, is in the middle of its own string of layoffs as the company aims to reduce its workforce by 18,000. 
The hearts of Game Informer&#x27;s staff are with all those who were affected by these layoffs.

                              <span>In January 2022, Activision filed a copyright and unfair competition lawsuit against cheat maker EngineOwning. Activision says the cheat maker trafficks in circumvention devices but the defendants now want the entire case thrown out. In a motion to dismiss, EngineOwning reveals that Activision sued them in Germany over two years ago and the lawsuit is still ongoing.

Everyone has something they loved spending time with in the past – a restaurant, a daily-play video game, a group of friends – only to one day unknowingly enjoy doing so for the final time. It&#x27;s a poignant and often heartbreaking truth of how places evolve, tastes change, and priorities divert as we all grow older. For the eponymous hero in Lil Gator Game, that activity is live-action role-playing with his big sis. With his sister home from college, Gator assembles a master plan to pry her away from her coursework for one more game. The resulting advent…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. 
While it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn&#x27;t account for every person that watched the series, but it&#x27;s a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year.

January 18, 2023
As you can see, there&#x27;s not much to go on here, so it&#x27;s currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023.

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird&#x27;s eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. 
With Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it&#x27;s no surprise we&#x27;re getting a trailer like this today. It&#x27;s a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There&#x27;s even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. 
Check out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: 


For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25.

                              <span>Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony&#x27;s handheld platform.
Persona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise&#x27;s reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they&#x27;ve been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.
Join Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game&#x27;s first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.

                              <span>Heads up, Stadia owners: Google’s cloud gaming program is shutting down today, January 18. The service began issuing refunds for all hardware last November, but if you haven’t received one yet, information on how to obtain one should have been emailed to the Google account used to make the purchase. However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.
There&#x27;s a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won&#x27;t be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.
Stadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

If you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia&#x27;s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” 
Stadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail. Rest in peace, Stadia.</span>

Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s public demo gave players a chance to experience a more general idea of what this fast-paced action game offers, but Koei Tecmo recently gave us the chance to go deeper and play through the first two chapters in Wo Long in full. I’m starting to understand that developer Team Ninja is aiming for a wider swath of players with Wo Long as opposed to its Nioh titles, which are some of the most demanding in games. While Wo Long still features that trademark From Software-inspired challenge, it also features a unique system that allows you to change an enemy’s…</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us, the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Naughty Dog&#x27;s hit game of the same name, finally premiered Sunday and it&#x27;s looking like a massive hit for HBO. 
That&#x27;s because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO series since 2010, beaten only by last year&#x27;s House of the Dragon, the first TV spinoff from HBO&#x27;s Game of Thrones series. The Last of Us drew in 4.7 million views, according to a Deadline report, coming in second to House of the Dragon&#x27;s 2022 premiere which pulled in 9.986 million watchers. The Last of Us is matched by HBO&#x27;s Boardwalk Empire, which premiered in 2010 to 4.81 million viewers. 
Deadline writes that HBO says Sunday night viewing usually represents 20 to 40% of a given show&#x27;s gross audience per episode (HBO shows typically release episodes on Sunday nights). 
&quot;We are thrilled to see fans of the series and game alike experience this iconic story in a new way, and we extend our gratitude to them for helping to make it a success,&quot; CEO and chairman of HBO and HBO Max Content Casey Bloys said, according to Deadline. &quot;Congratulations to [showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who is also a co-creator of The Last of Us], and the brilliant cast and crew who worked tirelessly to bring this show to life. We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.&quot; 
&quot;Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,&quot; Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. &quot;We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.&quot; 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

This image, which you can view in the tweet below, comes from the 4chan forum, as reported by Video Games Chronicle, which has also verified with sources that the image is real. The image appears to be Suicide Squad&#x27;s start menu and features standard things like game mode selection, chapter select, difficulty, and matchmaking. It also features some menus to page through at the top, including a &quot;Battle Pass&quot; one. Under those top-bar menus are what appear to be various currencies, too.

&quot;You know how fuzzy memories can be.&quot; It&#x27;s a convenient and hand-wavy line delivered by the new character Lim, warning the Straw Hat Pirates of the impending adventures into some of One Piece&#x27;s most popular story arcs. Likewise, One Piece Odyssey can be a fuzzy experience. It oscillates between being thrilling and tedious. The promise of discovering &quot;what if…?&quot; scenarios is enticing for longtime fans, but it rarely follows through in a meaningful way. And as a potential introductory point for new fans, One Piece O…</span>

Golf Story was one of the biggest surprises in the Switch’s extremely strong first year on the market. Thanks to Golf Story’s charming, nostalgic presentation and novel sports/RPG fusion, Sports Story has long been one of my most anticipated sequels. Unfortunately, its unfocused nature and frustrating gameplay are only overshadowed by a pervasive lack of polish that prevents Sports Story from being worth your time. 
As the name suggests, Sports Story expands the world to include other games while creating a more sweeping and ambitious story. As sports go…</span>

                              <span>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) started the New Year with a bang, raising over $2.6 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. For the unfamiliar, GDQ is a 24-hour charity live-stream where dedicated gamers show off speedruns of their favorite games. Before 2020, most events were held in person, but since then they&#x27;ve mostly been broadcasted from streamers&#x27; homes. This year&#x27;s event ran from January 8-15 and included over 140 runs.

While most runners don&#x27;t expect to set new records during the marathon, a whopping four were set this year for the following games: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge, PowerWash Simulator, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Steven Seagal Is: The Final Option (Prototype). Most years have one or two records set, but four is a big deal.
2023 marks the 14th year that the biannual charity marathon has taken place. They have two main events in the winter and summer, but they also hold smaller events throughout the year. One of these is Frost Fatales, an all-women speedrunning event, which will take place from February 26 - March 4, 2023 on Twitch. Since it was founded in 2010, the organization has raised over $43 million for charity.
AGDQ was initially set to be in person but was moved online due to COVID concerns. Their summer event, Summer Games Done Quick, will be held from May 28 - June 4, though it&#x27;s unclear whether the event will also take place in person.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>Rejoice, for we are now in feature freeze for the 13.0 release series just in time for a new year! Some last minute features and fixed made it into the new year. Especially notable are the new vehicle variants feature for NewGRFs and automatic flipping support for shorten-than-default NewGRF-defined vehicles. On the fixing side, focus was on polishing the new fractional GUI zoom and some other minor bits and pieces. Testing is more important than ever, so please keep it up, and report any issues as normal! Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
