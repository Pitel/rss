Nově vydaná verze rozšiřuje experimentálně podporu i o 64-bit RISC-V ISA a úspěšně prochází RV32IM a RV64IM oficiálními testy, které jsou nyní přidané k již existujícím unit a integračním testům do GitHub automatizace. Stránky projektu najdete na GitHubu. Materiály k výuce architektur počítačů na ČVUT najdete na comparch.edu.cvut.cz včetně online verze (zatím starší 0.9.3) simulátoru spustitelné v prohlížeči.

K dispozici je zde i odkaz na článek a prezentaci z Embedded World Conference 2022. Rozhovor o účasti autorů na výstavě a konferenci Embedded World 2022 byl publikovaný na stránkách studijního programu Otevřená Informatika na ČVUT FEL.

Novou verzi simulátoru a jeho využití ve výuce bude prezentovat Jakub Dupák na DevConf CZ MINI ve čtvrtek 3. listopadu od 17:30 v posluchárně D1 brněnské Masarykovy univerzity. Přednášky by měly být dostupné online i zpětně na streamu.</span>

However, starting today, you’ll be able to play the game for the first time as the three main characters from the original trilogy.

One of those was, uh, sinking $3 million into the creation of an adult-oriented FMV game called Sacred Pools, that was so bad it ended up being binned before it was ever released.

                              <span>Knuckles takes a wrong left turn somewhere
The next Sonic game isn&#x27;t too far off, and today Sega released a video setting the stage for the hedgehog&#x27;s new adventure. A new Sonic Frontiers Prologue video puts the spotlight on what Knuckles has been up to.
This prologue, called Divergence, follows Knuckles as he tends to the Master Emerald on his island. We get a little lore refresher on his backstory, before seeing him make a new discovery on his island.
Some old tech whirs to life after he tinkers with it, and he winds up in a new location. As it turns out, it looks like Knuckles is in a Sonic Frontiers locale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_gjszHTDjzo
While Knuckles can certainly fend for himself, it looks like he&#x27;s not strong enough to hold off this antagonist. Seems like Sonic, and by extension the player, will need to lend a helping hand.
A new frontier
This is one of several lead-in stories, meant to set the stage for Sonic Frontiers. It seems like we&#x27;re dealing with a strange new foe, and that means a little more table-setting than &quot;Eggman&#x27;s at it again.&quot;
Still, we&#x27;re somehow only a week out from the release of the new Sonic game. Revealed at The Game Awards in 2021, Frontiers has been the subject of both curiosity and scrutiny.
We&#x27;ve seen a fair bit of Frontiers already. There are its larger areas to explore and puzzles to solve. And there are some more familiar designs, akin to older Sonic entries.
Whether this new look for Sonic comes together, I just hope Knuckles turns out okay. I don&#x27;t like the look of that Matrix bubble prison one bit.
Sonic Frontiers will launch for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 8.

                              <span>And a few Walking Dead seasons
It&#x27;s an Xbox Game Pass Vampire Survivors kind of month, as the popular arcadey survival game expands its reach to consoles.
Microsoft has unveiled its early-to-mid Xbox Game Pass list, and things are looking pretty good for adventure and sports fans. As for the former, Return to Monkey Island is a standout, but there&#x27;s also two seasons of Walking Dead: A New Frontier, and Michonne. As a reminder, New Frontier is the follow-up to the original Walking Dead first two seasons, continuing the story of Clementine, with newcomer Javi. Football Manager 2023 (both PC and console editions), which is a huge &quot;may as well mess around with this a bit&quot; kind of game, represents the sports world.
Of course, Vampire Survivors on console is a nice get. Despite the cheap price, I can see a lot of on the fence people trying before they buy here.

Despite having only launched just one month ago, Electronic Arts&#x27; FIFA 23 has already seen more engagement and playtime than some games can only dream of in their entire lifespan — Not only is the soccer sim the fastest-selling entry in franchise history, but the community has already played some 1.7 billion matches over the course of the past four weeks.
EA Sports noted the bewildering figure in a fun stat sheet pertaining to the new title, which launched on PC and consoles on September 29. According to the figures, over 200 nations have played for a total of 15 billion minutes, scoring 4.3 billion goals across the 1.7 billion matches. The top male goal scorer is Manchester United and England National player Marcus Rashford, while the top female scorer is Chelsea Women&#x27;s Sam Kerr. Kerr also features on the cover of the Ultimate Edition and is the first woman soccer player to do so.

It should also be noted that AFC Richmond has racked up one million match wins to date. Good job, Ted.
FIFA 23 will be the final title in the decades-long franchise to feature joint collaboration between developer Electronic Arts and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) brand. Following a complex (and somewhat bitter) licensing dispute, the two billion-dollar juggernauts decided to part ways in 2021. Electronic Arts&#x27; future soccer sims will retail under the new name of EA Sports FC, while the FIFA organization has stated its intention on developing its own rival soccer series, which it claims will &quot;remain THE BEST&quot;. Hmm.
FIFA 23 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>&quot;Add PVE now, and delete the battle pass system&quot;
An Overwatch 2 survey is rolling out for a number of users, and so far, it&#x27;s a chance for active players to voice their ire for the new systems put in place in the &quot;sequel.&quot;
Shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit, scores of users are reporting that they&#x27;ve obtained an email from Blizzard, asking for feedback for the battle pass and Overwatch Store (read: the cyclical direct payment cosmetic store). As Eurogamer points out, some users are getting different &quot;triggers&quot; for the emails, that range from purchasing content, to not purchasing content. So it seems as if they&#x27;re trying to get an array of feedback from pretty much everyone. As of publication, I personally have not gotten an email yet.
We&#x27;re gonna need a bigger survey
As we&#x27;ve pointed out (particularly in the past week), Overwatch 2 is not running very smoothly post-launch. Some of the microtransactions feel particularly predatory, and one of the first major seasonal events isn&#x27;t up to par.
While the game itself does still mostly feel like Overwatch, the main thing I noticed when first booting it up (and still deal with now) is how busy the game is. The season pass system isn&#x27;t an upgrade, and I&#x27;m particularly worried about future seasons, especially ones that add characters into the mix.
One of the chief issues is that Blizzard, when erasing the original Overwatch and adding this free-to-play scheme, didn&#x27;t really add much value: even for premium season pass owners. Maybe the PVE update will change that, but most of us are wondering when that will even happen (and some of you will be long gone, and won&#x27;t wait that long to find out how it impacts Overwatch 2).

                              <span>Still more questions remain
Kojima Productions has revealed another cast member who will be joining Elle Fanning in the studio&#x27;s as-yet-unrevealed new title — Shioli Kutsuna, perhaps best known for their appearance as Yukio in Deadpool 2, will star in the new game in an as-yet-undisclosed role.
Shioli Kutsuna&#x27;s presence was confirmed in another &quot;headshot&quot; teaser image, which sees the 29-year-old Japanese-Australian actor staring dead-on into the lens, engulfed in red light and emblazoned with the question &quot;Where Am I?&quot;, similar imagery was used to tease the identity, and the eventual reveal of, Elle Fanning, who film fans will recognize from cinema jaunts such as Disney&#x27;s Maleficent and Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s excellent psychological horror The Neon Demon.
Producer Hideo Kojima is yet to spill the beans on the new title, which is believed to be a brand new IP, rather than a follow-up to his studio&#x27;s 2019 release, Death Stranding. Kojima Productions is currently working on the new game in tandem with a sequel to Death Stranding itself. And, given Kojima&#x27;s close relationship with industry pundit Geoff Keighley, it seems likely that we will be hearing more about the mysterious new project at the upcoming Game Awards — currently set to take place on December 8.

                              <span>Over three million consoles moved in last quarter
Sony Interactive Entertainment has released its financial results for fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, which shows that its most recent hardware platform, PlayStation 5 (PS5), has smashed past 25 million global shipments since its initial launch in November 2020.
According to the data, the shiny white behemoth shipped 3.3 million units in the most recent quarter, more or less matching the same period in 2021 and thus presenting steady sales for the (admittedly expensive) hardware. While there have been some struggles getting the ninth generation off to a strong start — impacted by production woes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost of living crisis — it appears that sales of the PS5 system remain relatively comfortable for the time being.
In addition to the hardware figures, SIE also revealed that there are currently 45.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, though this figure is down some 1.8 million users from the same time frame one year ago. Much like Microsoft&#x27;s the Xbox Game Pass service, it seems that PlayStation is continually struggling to grow its subscriber base, which had seen nothing but growth until the 2021 economy slump. Still, 45 million players is nothing to be sniffed at, and so it is unlikely that the publisher will be too concerned.
Further decline was seen in total game sales, with PS4 and PS5 combined software sales down a huge 13.9 million units over 2021, for a grand total of 62.5 million games sold. 63% of all full game sales were digital purchases — demonstrating that while the digital market continues its inevitable growth, physical media is not quite ready to be consigned to the garbage pile just yet.

As the crisp, autumnal leaves cover the ground, and the chilly nights draw in, it&#x27;s the perfect time to snuggle up inside and play something a bit cosier. Harvestella, Square Enix&#x27;s attempt at breaking into the farming sim genre, should fill that gap nicely come this Friday when it launches as a console exclusive on Switch, and the first review for the game has now dropped (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).
This week&#x27;s Famitsu scores have dropped, and Square Enix — in partnership with Live Wire — seems to have grown something quite pleasant, as the publication has awarded the game 8/8/8/7, or 31/40. Not bad at all!

                              <span>All the 2D and 3D Marios ranked by you.
On the 15th anniversary of Super Mario Galaxy&#x27;s release, we&#x27;ve decided to revisit and revamp our all-time Best Super Mario Games article. Previously, we had the plumber&#x27;s 2D and 3D adventures separated into two reader-ranked lists, with this overall uber-list compiled by Nintendo Life staff... but no more!
Now, for your reading pleasure, we have distilled the disparate rankings into a single reader-ranked article covering every single one of Mario&#x27;s mainline platformers across all dimensions. If you&#x27;re interested in our personal opinions, check out our video at the very end of the article.

We said this back in 2016, and we&#x27;ll say it again — a game with a title like Chompy Chomp Chomp Party is pretty hard to ignore. This multiplayer party game launched on the Wii U eShop in 2016, and on 17th November, you&#x27;ll be able to get it on Switch, and it&#x27;s coming with new game modes, more level themes, and a new level pack.
Developed by Utopian World of Sandwiches (another contender for the best game developer name ever), Chompy Chomp Chomp Party allows up to eight players to get together and cause chaos. In the Wii U game, there were three base modes — Chase &amp; Chomp, Keep The Thing, and Zone Dash — but with the Switch release, there will be eight modes available off the bat, with more to come in the future.

Publisher Nacon has released a new trailer for its upcoming rally racer WRC Generations, confirming that the game will be launching on Nintendo Switch on December 1st, 2022. It&#x27;s arriving a bit earlier on other platforms this week on November 3rd, so presumably developer Kylotonn needs a bit more time to get the title fully optimised for Switch.
WRC Generations reportedly has the largest selection of cars, tracks, and special stages in the series to date. Nacon has also detailed &#x27;Leagues Mode&#x27;, which will be cross-platform on everything other than Switch, so that&#x27;s... not ideal.

Publisher Gameloft has announced that the modern revival of The Oregon Trail will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch after a period of exclusivity on Apple Arcade.
No firm release date has been set at the time of writing, but in a recent tweet, Gameloft stated that players will be able to play the &quot;global phenomenon&quot; by the end of November, so chances are the game will launch at some point in the next few weeks.

Japanese video game giant Sega has provided an update on its &quot;super game&quot; in its integrated report for 2022, reaffirming the company&#x27;s commitment to the project and claiming it&#x27;ll be out by fiscal year ending March 2026.
In a section of the report about the company&#x27;s &quot;long-term targets&quot;, it&#x27;s mentioned how Sega is &quot;striving to create a super game&quot;, which would be a &quot;major title&quot; with a global release. It&#x27;s &quot;currently developing&quot; the title, and says the &quot;ultimate goal&quot; is to create something so revolutionary it will attract more users than any other project it&#x27;s worked on.

Overwatch 2 launched as a free-to-play title last month, and it&#x27;s not been the smoothest rollout. There were errors, reports of mass DDoS attacks and concerns raised about unlockables being secured behind a paywall. Blizzard even went to the extent of apologising to players for these launch issues with some free rewards and said it would &quot;continue to listen&quot; to the community.
With this in mind, Overwatch 2 players seem to now be getting sent surveys. According to one post on game&#x27;s subreddit, this survey focuses a lot on the game&#x27;s Battle Pass as well as the Overwatch store, which is filled with cosmetic microtransactions and more.

Nintendo has just released another new firmware update for the Switch - bumping the system up to Version 15.0.1.
This one resolves a few issues including one problem causing an error code when playing DLC on a unit that&#x27;s not your primary console. It also fixes an issue preventing screenshots during certain in-game scenes on select games. And as usual, it comes with general system stability improvements.

                              <span>Sometimes, I just want to wander around an aesthetically pleasing landscape with nice music doing menial tasks - and that’s exactly what I got from Paradise Marsh, a lovely little wildlife game from LazyEti. I’ve been playing some pretty intense games recently, throttling my game controller as I run away from literal waves of rats in A Plague Tale: Requiem and shifting my detective brain into overdrive grappling with the excellent mysteries in The Case of the Golden Idol.
I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain. Paradise Marsh has been the exact tonic I’ve needed, a chill bug-collectathon where you wander around pleasant, pastel landscapes discovering lots of fun little curiosities. It’s wonderful.

Unlike when Bastion was disabled because of his glitching ultimate, however, Mei does at least have a return date pencilled in. Blizzard are aiming to get her back in Overwatch 2 for November 15th, when the game’s next scheduled patch drops. That still might slip, though. What? I had to get an ice crack in.

                              <span>Just over a week ago, we launched a new introductory offer for the RPS supporter programme that chops the price of our monthly Standard tier down to just £1 / $1 for your first month. This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it&#x27;s clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we&#x27;re doing just that. 
For the month of November, we&#x27;ll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We&#x27;ve also made a bunch of Sin Vega&#x27;s indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we&#x27;ve got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we&#x27;re doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November. But wait... there&#x27;s more!

Microsoft today laid out the comings and goings for the first half of November, headlined by Return To Monkey Island. The revival of the revered point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game series will hit Game Pass next week, and until then you can tide yourself over with modernistic adventures from more of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead. Read on for the rest of the games coming in the next fortnight, including some on their launch day, and those sadly leaving too.

                              <span>Mount &amp; Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad. In fact, it&#x27;s overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord&#x27;s design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what&#x27;s been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn&#x27;t meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click &quot;make charcoal&quot;, then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you&#x27;ll discard hundreds of them. You can&#x27;t do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone&#x27;s pommel.

The original puzzle adventure was released on PC on October 31st 1997, and Cyan made their remake announcement exactly 25 years later. The new version of Riven will adopt the Myst remake’s freely 3D movement, but there are very few details yet other than that. Watch the very short announcement teaser below.

                              <span>At least two more Marvel superhero games are coming from EA as part of a long-term deal with Marvel. We already knew about Motive Studios’ single-player Iron Man action adventure game, announced in September, but the others are still just an amorphous blob of creativity that probably gives you the proportionate strength and speed of a badger on physical contact. The revelation that EA and Marvel are forging some kind of Marvel Gaming Universe may delight or frustrate you, depending on how fed up you are with the MCU.

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Developer Salt &amp; Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That&#x27;s because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror&#x27;s inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you&#x27;ll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

                              <span>The Last of Us TV series will premiere in a little over two months if HBO&#x27;s page for the show is any indication. 
HBO Max subscribers began to notice that on the page for The Last of Us series on HBO, a description of the show says it premieres on January 15, as reported by Eurogamer. The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there. Check it out in my screenshot below: 
&quot;A preview of the post-apocalyptic drama series based on the critically acclaimed video game,&quot; The Last of Us: Season 1 Sneak Peek&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Premieres January 15.&quot; 
This lines up with what&#x27;s expected of an HBO series, too, as the subscription services&#x27; shows are not usually dropped in bulk, like on Netflix. Instead, HBO sticks to the weekly release popularized with standard television, and that the description says the show simply premieres January 15 means new episodes of The Last of Us will likely release each week. January 15 is also a Sunday, and episodes for HBO&#x27;s biggest shows typically release on Sunday evenings, like House of the Dragon. My money&#x27;s on new episodes of this show dropping each Sunday for however many weeks at 9 p.m. ET. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now if HBO&#x27;s description is correct. 
In the meantime, watch this teaser for HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us and then watch this full trailer for the show. Read about how Marlene actor Merle Dandridge is reprising her role from the game in the show after that and then watch this video about our thoughts on the recent remake of The Last of Us.

The Call of Duty series has featured digital recreations of real places for years, including everything from  for the newly-released Modern Warfare II, that includes a whole level that&#x27;s meant to replicate the streets of Amsterdam closely to real life as possible. That included a hotel called the Conservatorium, which is indeed beautiful, but it seems the management is displeased with the building&#x27;s inclusion in the game as a Modern Warfare II map.
As originally reported by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant (and translated by PC Gamer), the hotel&#x27;s manager Roy Tomassen has released a statement implying that they might take legal action against Activision. &quot;Breenbergh&quot; is the level in question, and features the hotel in both a mu…</span>

Publisher Raw Fury, in association with developer Shedworks, has announced that the critically acclaimed sci-fi adventure Sable will be coming to PS5 next month, following on from its previous release on Xbox and PC platforms in the fall of 2021.
Sable, for those yet to have experienced it, is an ethereal adventure game set within the isolated desert lands of The Midden. Players guide a mysterious protagonist as they venture across the plains and dunes astride a futuristic hoverbike, searching lonely caves, crumbling ruins, and encountering forgotten nomadic civilizations while on a search for their own identity.
You can check out Sable&#x27;s fascinating world and evocative visual style in the trailer below.

Upon release, the title was praised for its enigmatic and open narrative, as well as its striking visuals and beautiful score, composed by artist Japanese Breakfast. The PS5 edition will feature the game in its entirety, with further optimization for the DualSense&#x27; Haptic Feedback technology. In addition, the PS5 version will feature a new fishing mini-game, allowing the player to gather rare breeds of finned wonderment to display in an in-game aquarium. As we all know, it isn&#x27;t a real game without fishing.
Sable will launch on PS5 November 29. It is available right now on PC and Xbox platforms.

Dungeon-crawling RPG Kowloon High School Chronicle is making its way to PC via Steam. Arc System Works is releasing the updated version of the PS2 RPG onto Steam on November 10.
This remastered version has already been released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Now, PC players will get a chance to check out this older dungeon crawler. The Steam page is live here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HgFfhjaPoZc
Kowloon High School Chronicle first launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan, back in 2004. The new remaster not only brings it to new systems, but adds some revamped graphics.
The set-up of Kowloon is pretty interesting, too. You play a young treasure hunter masquerading as a transfer student. During the day, the player attends class and hangs out with friends, using a novel and slightly bizarre conversation system to foster relationships.
Then at night, the protagonist and their party can venture into the labyrinths and catacombs beneath the school, in pursuit of hidden treasure. This is where it becomes a first-person dungeon crawler, with some pretty neat puzzles.
Daily life of treasure hunters
I&#x27;ve played a solid chunk of the Nintendo Switch version of Kowloon High School Chronicle, and it&#x27;s definitely a different kind of RPG. Between the style, music, and life sim elements, it&#x27;s got a fair bit of Persona in it.
But I&#x27;m also a big fan of crunchy, weird interfaces and old internet UI. I mean, look at this wanted ad from the game&#x27;s in-universe internet.

If you want something offbeat, this might be what you&#x27;re looking for. Especially those of you looking to load up the Steam Deck with RPGs before the holidays.
Kowloon High School Chronicle hits PC via Steam on November 10, and is also currently available on PS4 and Switch.

Since E3, I have hit the books on really deeply learning the tarot more than ever. The appearance of the tarot in various video games has always fascinated me. Games like the Persona and Tactics Ogre series have often placed the tarot front and center in meaningful ways, and it&#x27;s also a reason my healer of choice in Final Fantasy XIV is Astrologian.
And thankfully it&#x27;s these games that informed my views and got me reading up, instead of whatever that Twin Flame/Gemini-you-knew-from-high-school-drama-class-is-coming-back-into-your-life crystal-grifting brain rot on TikTok and YouTube is. I like the crystals because they&#x27;re shiny, that&#x27;s it. Sparkly rocks.
Anyway, I&#x27;m back in time for Halloween with more decks of cards and while I could use them for introspective shadow work…</span>

                              <span>The team becomes Netflix&#x27;s sixth in-house studio
Netflix has announced another games studio acquisition. Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox is joining Netflix.
In an announcement from the studio, Spry Fox says this acquisition will allow for a few things. Firstly, the team will be able to make games they&#x27;ve been making and wanted to make, with more support and resources.
It will also reduce stress on Spry Fox&#x27;s games to generate profit, according to the studio, and give the team access to other creatives at Netflix for collaboration.
&quot;Real talk: we’ve been at this for almost 13 years,&quot; said the Spry Fox team in today&#x27;s statement. &quot;It’s been exhilarating, humbling, endlessly interesting and often challenging. We’ve always known that above all else, we wanted our games to bring people happiness. …</span>

                              <span>It takes place in a haunted version of the Korok Forest
Famous modder Waikuteru is at it again, this time with a Zelda: Breath of the Wild Halloween &quot;DLC&quot; mod that injects some spookiness into the mix, and adds a new questline and major enemy.
It all starts with a quest called &quot;The Halloween Hunt,&quot; which is picked up in the Korok Forest. Apparently the residing Koroks are &quot;in distress,&quot; and it&#x27;s up to you to solve the mystery of the haunted zone and square off against a new foe called the Ghost Rider. If they appear you need to outrun them, or head back to the Korok Forest to get them off your tail. When the appear, the screen goes dark purple, and there&#x27;s a sufficiently scary freak-out sequence.
The gist is that you&#x27;ll embark upon a journey to collect 30 Cursed Pumpkins, which a friendly Korok named Socki can use to make a stew to dispel the magic therein. You&#x27;ll don a spooky outfit for the occasion (which is required to avoid the detection of the aforementioned monster), and the quest has a 30-minute timer on it. Once you&#x27;re finished you can take out the Ghost Rider once and for all!
As usual, everyone involved (including Waikuteru and their friend Sockpoppet, who worked on custom enemies and items for the mod) is a talented bunch: the Zelda: Breath of the Wild modding community is outstanding in terms of scope.

                              <span>&quot;The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.&quot;
God of War Ragnarok transmog (read: the ability to customize the look of your gear without losing its stats) is in! The news comes straight from the game&#x27;s official Discord, where a developer Q&amp;A confirmed it.
While the Q&amp;A was conducted over voice, MP1st managed to get the full transcription, where combat lead Mihir Sheth spilled the beans on God of War Ragnarok transmog:
Q: &quot;Since we’re talking about armor. I like to look good, alright everyone at the studio knows this about me. Fashion first for Kratos, of course. I know one of the request for 2018 was the ability to maybe have the stats you want, but you know, give Kratos the runway look you want. So this is a question from SpiritWolf and a lot of other people; Will there be an armor transmog system?&quot;
Mihir Sheth: &quot;The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.&quot;

The answer is a bit cryptic, and it&#x27;s unclear whether or not it&#x27;s going to be a free-for-all anything goes model (where you can just toggle it), or if it needs to be unlocked/requires a reagent/consumable of some kind. Either way, it&#x27;s confirmed in some form.
At this point with any AAA game with gear, transmog is not only a highly-requested feature, but expected. Games are even adding it after launch because of how many people are requesting it.

                              <span>An adventure classic is being remade from the ground up
Cyan is remaking another one of its classics, this time in Riven. The studio has announced it is developing a Riven remake from the ground up.
Riven, or Riven: The Sequel to Myst, will be getting a full, modern remake. Cyan&#x27;s already produced a remake for Myst, and it seems like this will be a similar undertaking.
In an FAQ online, Cyan addresses the basics. Yes, this is a remake from the ground up, not a remaster. The new Riven remake will also be fully traversable in 3D.
No details on platforms or dates have been announced yet. But this will be a new game, so expect to buy a new product, rather than get it for free if you already have the classic Riven.
As to why Cyan is doing this now, and after 25 years? Here&#x27;s their explanation:
&quot;Riven is one of the most highly regarded games in Cyan’s history. We didn’t want to approach it lightly or frivolously. Cyan is a small indie studio. We wanted to make sure we could take on such a difficult, costly and complicated endeavor – and do it well.&quot;

https://twitter.com/cyanworlds/status/1587065601339424770
Remaking the sequel to Myst
There was also a fan project in the works, the Starry Expanse Project, to remake Riven. Alongside news of the remake, Cyan confirms that project has been ceased development. The Starry Expanse team continues to exist, independent from Cyan, though the two teams collaborated early on to kickstart the official remake development, according to Cyan&#x27;s letter. One member of the Starry Expanse team has also been hired by Cyan.
&quot;So for the first time publicly, we are happy to report that our effort to remake Riven officially here at Cyan is alive and well, and it was helped by the Starry Expanse team’s years of effort, enabling us to begin the huge task of rebuilding Riven from scratch,&quot; said Cyan. &quot;With a very focused development team here at Cyan, Riven is well on its way to being reborn!&quot;

                              <span>Nice place you&#x27;ve got here
Is Hallowe’en done yet? Each year I have the goal of playing as many horror games as possible in October, and usually, I get sidetracked, and it doesn’t happen. This year, I both succeeded and started early. And now, I’m sick of them. I don&#x27;t want any more monsters or grungy aesthetics. I’m tired of some dude with a knife getting in my way while I try to slot crests in their respective crest-holes.
I’m so tired of keys. I don&#x27;t even lock my door anymore... Okay, maybe one more.
Part of this initial flood of horror titles has been through Puppet Combo’s publisher label, Torture Star Video. Stay Out of the House is pure Puppet Combo. Guy’s been working on this one for a while, and it’s finally here. So, at least if I’m forcing myself to swallow one more morsel into…</span>

                              <span>The deal kicks off with the upcoming Iron Man game
EA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.
The deal was first reported today by Bloomberg, followed by an announcement from EA. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on &quot;at least three&quot; new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.
These games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was recently confirmed to be working on an Iron Man game.
&quot;At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,&quot; said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. &quot;We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their Iron Man video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.&quot;

A Marvel-ous deal
EA has a history with the Star Wars series already. Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have done pretty well. Well enough, in fact, that Respawn&#x27;s working on several more Star Wars projects.
With a Marvel deal locked in, it looks like Electronic Arts is deepening its ties to Disney properties.
The Marvel universe isn&#x27;t just stopping there, though. Skydance recently teased its upcoming Captain America-Black Panther project. (Skydance is also working on a Star Wars project.)
Plus, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is just around the corner in December. And Marvel Snap is gradually taking over everyone&#x27;s phones. The Marvel games roll-out just keeps growing.

Yikes! That&#x27;s just about the only thing that can sum up a lot of Overwatch 2 news post-launch, but this Overwatch 2 charm situation is so funny it has to be shared.
Over on the Overwatch Reddit, user hi_im_redbeard shared an anecdote that showcased how out of control the monetization scheme is in Overwatch 2. In short, they purchased a real life Pachimari keychain/charm that they can hold in their hand for cheaper than it costs to buy the same Overwatch 2 charm in-game. Showing their work, the Pachimari charm (literally just an in-game side item, almost NFT-like in nature) is 700 Overwatch Coins, which is more than $5 (which converts to 500 Coins). Yep, you have to do the standard scummy &quot;buy more than you need&quot; conversion here, so it&#x27;s even more expensive than roughly $7 if you need to top up.
There are plenty of economic nuances afoot, and this wouldn&#x27;t be the first time something like this happened; as some games (Pokemon Unite included) can put out insanely high-priced limited-run skins that are more expensive than an action figure of the character in question. But this particular incident showcases how Overwatch 2, in its move to &quot;free-to-play&quot; (and erasing the original premium game) has shoved in even more ways to monetize its audience with new cosmetics.
When some fans are asking to bring loot boxes back, you know you have a monetization problem. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see just how much content Overwatch 2 gets over time, how it&#x27;s even further monetized, and what the PVE element brings to the table (more monetization?).

                              <span>Audacity
Wizards of the Coast has provided us with another exclusive Magic Arena card (that&#x27;s also coming to paper Magic of course): Audacity. It&#x27;s set to debut in the The Brothers&#x27; War set, which is out on November 11 via pre-release, November 15 in Arena, and November 18 in paper Magic.
As a reminder, here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the lore for the release, to set the mood:
&quot;Through nefarious means, the evil Phyrexians establish a foothold on Dominaria. They secretly transform ordinary citizens into deadly sleeper agents who go about their lives, ignorant of their new purpose. As word of the Phyrexian incursion spreads, the people of Dominaria attempt to band together as the sleeper agents threaten to tear them apart.&quot;

The Brothers&#x27; War is going to have all sorts of lore implications, and follows the Dominaria United set that arrived back in September. From here, we&#x27;ll be delving even further into the story of the Phyrexians, with Phyrexia: All Will Be One, slated for January 2023. It&#x27;s a pretty busy block for Magic, as the Dominaria storyline/setting once again is hitting it pretty big with the community.
Destructoid&#x27;s exclusive Magic Arena card: Audacity

As for the card itself, it&#x27;s an enchantment aura called Audacity that costs G, enchants a creature, and provides a +2/+0 and trample bonus. When Audacity is put into the graveyard from the battlefield, you draw a card.
This is the sort of thing you wouldn&#x27;t mind drawing in most Magic formats, limited included. A low cost always ensures that it&#x27;s generally playable (or very playable), and although it&#x27;s not a flash/instant-speed enchantment. Plus, the art from Rudy Siswanto is killer and wonderfully showcases the direct conflict from the lore.
As usual, I can&#x27;t wait to pick one up and put it in a toploader!

                              <span>Producer Cory Barlog shared his frustration
A situation that led to God of War Ragnarok being leaked has led to a full confirmation of said leak from the game&#x27;s producer (Cory Barlog), a bit of venting, and a public warning.
As Barlog points out, a retailer has broken street date and sold God of War Ragnarok roughly two weeks before the November 9 release date; leading to posts online about the game, including screens, and down the line, potentially spoiler-related content. Consider this your warning!
Here&#x27;s a full recap of Barlog&#x27;s sentiments on Twitter over the weekend:
&quot;You know, right now, I can really understand the benefit of having just an installer on the physical disc. Smh. A retailer selling the game nearly TWO WEEKS before release. just so disappointing. Sorry to everyone that you have to dodge the spoilers if you want to play the game fresh. completely fucking stupid you have to do this. this is not at all how any of us at SMS wanted things to go. To be clear, I was expressing my frustration in the first tweet. not advocating for that at all. Not the future i want as a gamer or dev. just so beyond frustrated. Feel terrible for the team. This whole ordeal is incredibly stressful for us all. Mental health break time.&quot;

On the bright side, for Sony, God of War as a whole is a pretty impenetrable franchise that people will buy regardless. By that same token, it&#x27;s also so massive that a leak was almost inevitable: though several weeks early is not really the norm in many cases.
The big takeaway for everyone: be careful if you want to avoid spoilers!

This weekend saw the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) host its annual awards ceremony, The IGDA Global Industry Game Awards. The event recognizes some of the best titles in recent memory, with a keen focus on the mechanics, technical prowess, and use of new and upcoming technology to create titles that are as respected by developers as they are by button-mashing players.

While many titles were featured in the 2022 edition of the IGDA Game Awards, several titles, in particular, walked away with armfuls of gongs. The biggest winner was Arkane&#x27;s time-warping shooter Deathloop, which bagged itself a very impressive 13 awards across numerous categories. This was closely follow…</span>

                              <span>Three decades of demons
Atlus has shared a new piece of 30th anniversary Shin Megami Tensei art on their official Twitter account, and they have a lot to celebrate. That&#x27;s three decades of demon summoning, spinoffs, and success wrapped up in one tweet, with a few classic demons worked into the logo (like Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Pixie) to boot.
As Atlus points out, the series began in Japan on October 30, 1992: a sufficiently spooky release window, inline with the dark themes that the series typically plays with. Now it&#x27;s celebrating three decades in existence, with spinoffs that have spinoffs. The staying power of the SMT name is pretty awe-inspiring.
Recent Shin Megami Tensei happenings
As the Shin Megami Tensei art tweet shows the series as a whole is still going strong, having just launched Soul Hackers 2 this year, and Shin Megami Tensei V in 2021. The Persona umbrella is also enjoying a huge resplendent re-release era on multiple platforms, and arguably the best core SMT game, Nocturne, was remastered recently. Smartly, Atlus knows a lot of the older entries will still hold up with a few minor modern tweaks.
Shin Megami Tensei isn&#x27;t going anywhere for a long time.

                              <span>Welcome (back) to the jungle
A new recruitment video from studio Virtuos has sparked internet whispers that the global game developer has started work on a new Metal Gear Solid project. The rumors circulated this weekend after &quot;clues&quot; were spotted in the presentation, which was designed to spotlight the studio&#x27;s Montreal team.
While speaking with one of Virtuos&#x27; key concepts artists, Louis-Alex Boismenu, the hefty (and highly recommended) tome &quot;The Art of Metal Gear Solid&quot; is placed tantalizingly in shot, with the book seemingly being used to prop up Boismenu&#x27;s desk lamp. This might seem to be &quot;reaching&quot; on the fans&#x27; part, but it is rare that videos such as these would include such an odd detail. You&#x27;d think the book would be cleared aside during shot-blocking. I would have done so and I&#x27;m basically Kubrick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;bWjDzBrmveo&amp;t&#x3D;73s
Lending further weight to this theory are rumors, sourced by VGC back in 2021, that Virtuos might have been handed the contract to develop a remake of 2004 adventure Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This still unconfirmed rumor, coupled with some recent recruitment adverts and the aforementioned video, has led fans to believe that the studio is working on something Metal Gear Solid-related. However, who knows quite what is on the books or when the truth will out, remains a mystery.
All that said, it must be noted that sometimes a lamp prop is just a lamp prop... Still, it&#x27;s not hard to admit that these various clues are all starting to add up.

The Core i5 13600K is a 14-core / 20-thread processor (6 P cores + 8 E cores), up from 6 P cores + 4 E cores with the prior generation Core i5 12600K. The Core i5 13600K has a recommended customer price of $319~329, which is indeed being honored among Internet retailers and with robust availability. Here is an initial look at how the Core i5 13600K &quot;Raptor Lake&quot; is running under Ubuntu Linux.</span>

                              <span>Uživatelé Adobe produktů pracující se systémem barev Pantone mohou být překvapeni, když otevřou své výtvory v nových verzích produktů a místo svých pečlivě vybraných barev uvidí černou. Adobe odstranilo jejich definice a chce-li uživatel s nimi pracovat stejně jako dosud, potřebuje licenci u Pantone v ceně 15 dolarů měsíčně. Další možností je použité Pantone barvy ručně definovat nebo jejich definice zkopírovat ze starších verzí (Dovoluje to licence?), viz video na YouTube. Konkrétní barvu lze najít například na Encycolorpedii. Pro Pantone barvy bez Pantone názvů lze použít zdarma plugin Freetone (YouTube).</span>

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it&#x27;s slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that&#x27;s more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

                              <span>Logitech makes some of the best mainstream racing wheels and pedals on the market, but the cost of entry is still fairly steep: £269 for the PC/PlayStation-compatible G29 and the same for the PC/Xbox G920 variant. Today though, Currys in the UK are offering £80 off on either model when you use code WHEEL80, dropping the price down to £189.

The game is structured into four square panels in a two-by-two grid. Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene. This is where it gets cool: Any object you see that has some sort of frame around it - doorways, paintings, windows, photographs - you can actually move through them and discover new areas to explore.

                              <span>Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

                              <span>Immortality developer Sam Barlow has spoken about being contacted by electric car manufacturer Tesla for the opportunity to put interactive movie Her Story into their vehicles for no compensation other than “exposure”. Barlow’s comments emerged on Twitter in response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media platform, specifically, the suggestion that Twitter users may soon have to pay for blue tick verified status.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s lead hero designer has revealed Blizzard are working on new support heroes for the game as one of their “long-term focuses”. The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It&#x27;s not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

                              <span>Look, it&#x27;s all well and good wanting to get scared on Halloween or whatever. But some of us live the horror life every day of the year. We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there&#x27;s no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be &quot;Goth Christmas&quot;, but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine&#x27;s Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I&#x27;m determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday &quot;Goth Valentine&#x27;s&quot;. Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

                              <span>Putting together this list of the best early Black Friday SSD deals has proven trickier than expected, and not because Black Friday is still three weeks away. It’s because so many SSDs are subjected to dirty retailer tricks, mainly raising prices for the sole purpose of dropping them back down and calling it a “deal”. Naw, sir, not falling for that. What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there&#x27;s something for all kinds of PC builds.

                              <span>Horror games, you say? Feh, hardware can be scary too. One time I turned on a power supply and it literally went up in a cloud of smoke. Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

The Conservatorium Hotel, a five-star gaff that describes itself as the “living room of Amsterdam” on its website, hasn’t taken too kindly to being shot to pieces in digital form. Despite a name change, it’s still recognisably the same establishment.

                              <span>I am, generally speaking, a horror fan, but this year for Halloween I&#x27;ve niched down on a particular topic and it has sort of accidentally taken me away from horror. Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they&#x27;re one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They&#x27;ve already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I&#x27;ve collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I&#x27;ve not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

                              <span>As part of the game’s 1.05 patch, DC bad boy Black Adam finally joins the roster of fighters in Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus today. Adam is a bruiser and launches with an unlockable skin modelled after his classic comic book look, which nabs players extra candy during the Halloween event running through to the end of Multiversus’s first season on November 15th. Today’s 1.05 update sees an arcade mode added to the game too, along with a new casual Growth Spurt mode.

                              <span>The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

I&#x27;m currently competing for the title of trickster-in-chief here at RPS, and I&#x27;m never going to have a chance of receiving this promotion unless I reach my daily scare quota. If only there was a way I could package together a collection of scary stories as told my colleagues and claim them all as my own.

Aha! I got you again! They don&#x27;t call me the Merry Trickster Of UK PC Gaming Websites for nothing! You&#x27;ve been Halloween&#x27;d, my friends! To celebrate spooky season, I gathered seven members of the RPS treehouse to tell me about one moment from a PC game that scared them the most. The results were exactly as I expected. Some recounted events in classic horror games that shocked them senseless, whereas others told me anecdotes about games that most wouldn&#x27;t consider scary at all. The result is seven tales of spooks that are sure to chill your bones this All Hallows&#x27; Eve.

Video games and sports have a lot of overlap, and we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time trying to recreate our favourite stunts and moves in various sports games, but NASCAR racer Ross Chastain has done the opposite — he recreated a move he used to perform in NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup on GameCube to secure the final qualifying spot for the championship.
Shared on Twitter by @barstoolsports and Steve Lin from the Video Game History Foundation, this risky manoeuvre is known as a &#x27;wall ride&#x27; and involves literally driving right up against the wall to squeeze past the other cars.

It&#x27;s the creepiest day of the year, and given that we&#x27;ve already covered the Best Switch Horror Games, it&#x27;s the perfect opportunity to revisit this ranked list of every Resident Evil game on Nintendo consoles, especially given the recent release of Village (in cloud form — grr!) on Switch.
We&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to revamp this article and add it to our selection of real-time reader-ranked series lists based on each game&#x27;s rating in our games database. See something below that&#x27;s not where you think it should be? Feel free to tap on the star and rate any game below out of 10 to exert your influence and potentially reorder the list. Lots of the entries are very close together at the time of (re)publication, so we expect there to be plenty of movement over the next day or two until things settle down!

Around this time last year, we heard of the formation of QUByte Classics - a partnership between Publisher QUByte and Piko Interactive - and we have subsequently seen a whole host of classic 8- and 16-bit titles brought back to the Switch (The Humans, Tinhead, Jim Power: The Lost Dimension, amongst others). Well, another is set to join the scarcely-discussed collection this week, as The Samurai Collection (QUByte Classics) comes to Switch on 3rd November, 2022.
The collection brings together two beat &#x27;em ups from the 1990s: First Samurai and Second Samurai. Originally released in 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST, the first of these titles was later ported to the SNES, while its 1993 follow up came only to the Amiga and SEGA Mega Drive.

                              <span>Fixes, improvements, the lot.
Disney Dreamlight Valley has received a brand new hotfix update with a host of improvements and fixes to hopefully make your experience with the game that much better. This is reportedly based on user feedback since the release of the Scar&#x27;s Kingdom update, so hopefully this should mitigate any issues you might have been facing since its release.
Here are the full patch notes from Gameloft:

It is quickly becoming a universally acknowledged fact that at some point in our lives, all of us will become a playable skin in Epic Games&#x27; Fall Guys. After releasing the strange collaboration between Star Trek and Alien last month, the online knock-out game is set to expand its references even further into space (and time, for that matter).
In a gameplay trailer published today (thanks, Go Nintendo), Epic Games announced that Doctor Who would be the latest franchise to enter the world of Fall Guys, with a BBC collaboration bringing in new skins and emotes.

Are Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s Blood Moons and Stalhorses not spooky enough for you this Halloween? Well then, leave it to the well-known Zelda modder Waikuteru to give us what we want. Along with Sockpoppet, the two have created brand new DLC for the hugely popular open-world Switch game, and it&#x27;s fabulously appropriate for 31st October (thanks, Eurogamer!).
This fan-made DLC is called &#x27;The Halloween Hunt&#x27; and it gives players a ton of new things to do in the Zelda-pocalypse. There&#x27;s a whole new questline, new dialogue, new armour, a new recipe, more collecting, and even a brand new boss fight in The Phantom Rider.

We&#x27;ve got just over a week to go until Sonic Frontiers is finally out, and in preparation for its release, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka has sat down with Shacknews to talk about what this &quot;open-zone&quot; Sonic title will bring to the table (thanks, TheGamer!).
During the interview, the discussion soon turned to the Koco, creatures that you can collect throughout the game, with comparisons being drawn with Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s Korok Seeds. And back when Sonic Frontiers was first revealed, many thought this new vision for Sonic was taking inspiration from Nintendo&#x27;s massive open-world game. But Izuka suggests that, aside from the &quot;freedom&quot;, the two are very different games.

Sure, there are some notable exceptions like last week&#x27;s Judd and Li&#x27;l Judd cushions, and who can forget that big round Spheal from earlier this year?? But then you see an announcement like &#x27;Kirby Mouthful Mode plushies are coming in December, 2022&#x27; and all of a sudden, every other plushie fades into irrelevance.
Yes, there is a Car Mouth plushie on its way. Yes, it is big.

In a recent interview with Famitsu (kindly translated by the folks over at Nintendo Everything), Octopath Traveler II developers Masashi Takahashi (Producer) and Keisuke Miyauchi (Director) talked about how the game&#x27;s HD-2D visuals have been improved, stating an aim to make &quot;art that would be picture-perfect no matter when you screenshotted it&quot;.
It&#x27;s no secret that Octopath Traveler&#x27;s visuals struck a chord with fans worldwide, with the artistic style subsequently implemented in games such as Triangle Strategy and Live A Live. Takahashi and Miyauchi know that gamers harbour a sense of nostalgia for older pixel art games, and so aimed to take Octopath Traveler II&#x27;s visuals beyond the &quot;rose-tinted&quot; affection that fans have for older titles.

To mark the announcement, a new overview trailer has been showcased, demonstrating the game&#x27;s newly revamped visuals and gameplay; it&#x27;s certainly looking pretty spooky, we have to say! There will also be a digital deluxe edition of the game available at launch, which will include the Rogetsu Isle Dinner Party Costume Set along with a digital art book.

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

This news comes as a surprise considering how devoted Cavill has seemed to the role over the years, quickly becoming a fan-favorite after the release of Season 1. He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth&#x27;s casting in the role. 
&quot;My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,&quot; Cavill&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>A new study reveals how purchasing a Kodi-powered streaming box changed the Internet and media consumption habits of US households. The researchers use these boxes as a piracy proxy, as they were often loaded with third-party piracy apps. Interestingly, their data show that the use of these boxes led to increased legal consumption through on-demand services such as Netflix and YouTube.

                              <span>Geralt of Rivia is dead. Long live Geralt of Rivia
If you&#x27;ve been on social media at all in the past few days or managed to make it through the entirety of Black Adam, you&#x27;ve probably heard that Henry Cavill is once again suiting up as the Man of Steel. Whether or not his return to the DC Extended Universe will finally help Warner Bros. get that disaster train back on track remains to be seen. What we do know is that Cavill will be walking away from the role that&#x27;s kept him busy in the years since he had to have his mustache digitally removed in post-production. It was announced today that Cavill is stepping down as Geralt of Rivia in the hit Netflix adaptation of The Witcher.
https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1586433840318648321
As you can see in the tweet above, Cavill will be replaced in season 4 by Robert California Liam Hemsworth. The second-tier Hemsworth is probably best known for his role as Gale Hawthrone in the Hunger Games films and, like many of his fellow Aussies, a brief stint on the soap opera Neighbours. He also did a show for Quibi. Raise your hand if you remember Quibi.
While Cavill is leaving the Netflix series behind, fans will still be able to see him as Geralt when The Witcher&#x27;s third season debuts sometime next year. If you&#x27;re like me and just subscribed to Netflix for the first time in six years a few days ago, know there is a lot of Witcher content to consume on the streamer, including the animated film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf and The Witcher: Blood Origin, a prequel series that&#x27;ll debut in December (fingers crossed it&#x27;s better than that dreary House of the Dragon). In addition to all that, a second animated film has also been commissioned and there is apparently a family-friendly spin-off in the works.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s launch hasn&#x27;t gone according to plan, with players reporting various crash bugs.

I do always enjoy Halloweentime, and not just because I own a litre of movie-grade fake blood. It&#x27;s nice to enjoy this sort of stuff as the days draw shorter, and after this we get to launch into Christmastime and 24/7 Hallmark Channel movies (pro tip: look for ones with Andrew W Walker or Cameron Mathison, they&#x27;re usually good). But first, what are you playing this weekend? We do have some offbeat Halloween lists if you need inspiration. And here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

It&#x27;s a pretty good time to be a fan of farm sims right now. We&#x27;re just days away from the launches of Square-Enix&#x27;s Harvestella and Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom, while Disney Dreamlight Valley is proving popular enough for people looking to get their farming fix with a heaping dose of Disney magic. Plenty of stuff to enjoy right now, but it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s launching next year that has me more excited than anything else. Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake heads our way in a matter of months. Initially revealed for the Nintendo Switch, Xseed Games confirmed this week the A Wonderful Life remake will launch on all modern platforms simultaneously in North America.
Set in the tranquil Forgotten Valley, A Wonderful Life tasks players with building up a farm and seeing it through to the end of their character&#x27;s life. Life with other games in the series, players can get married and start a family, but your decisions will determine if your kid carries on the family tradition of running the farm or setting off to discover their own path in life. As has already been confirmed, all marriage candidates can be romanced no matter your farmer&#x27;s chosen gender, and players can make their farmer non-binary.

The Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life remake will release on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S next summer. As a reminder, Xseed Games is also releasing a remastered edition of Rune Factory 3, titled Rune Factory 3 Special, in 2023. That game is currently only on tap for the Switch.

                              <span>The company is working on a &quot;large-scale, global title&quot;
Sega is continuing to work on its &quot;Super Game&quot; project, and it now has a rough deadline. The company wants to launch its super game by March 2026, at the latest.
The super game is something the company has talked about before, as part of its long-term strategy. And in a recent financial filing, Sega is ballparking it for a launch sometime before March 2026.
As for what a super game is, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi describes it as a large-scale, global title. The ultimate goal for this project is to generate more active users than any other games they&#x27;ve made thus far.
&quot;One key to achieving this goal is whether we can draw together a large community, involving not only players but also streamers who stream the game and viewers who watch their videos,&quot; said Satomi in the filing. &quot;That kind of community expands and further develops game content, adding value to the game that is unimagined by developers, and sparking a broader movement—which can then draw in even more users and grow the game’s presence dramatically.&quot;
There have been some rumors about what the super game project might entail, but we&#x27;ve still yet to get a firm idea.

A new frontier
We do know that this super game isn&#x27;t Sonic Frontiers, which is set to launch in November. Sega also has a few other games in store between now and 2026, like the recently revealed Like a Dragon: Ishin.
There&#x27;s more in the works for Sega&#x27;s older IP, too. In the filing today, the company specifically cites &quot;dormant&quot; IP. The company will continue to develop these by &quot;means of remakes, remastering, and reboots,&quot; so it sounds like more old Sega hits could see the limelight.

It&#x27;s all of the fun of a time-honored tradition with none of the work or mess, so that&#x27;s a win-win in my book. While there are some pretty impressive carvings out there, obviously the best ones are the gaming-themed gourds, and there are plenty of them out there. This year, I scoured Reddit in search of the best pumpkins so you don&#x27;t have to, and I have to say that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the selection this year.
Cult of the Lamb
Starting off strong with one of my favorite games of the year, this pumpkin features the titular character of Cult of the Lamb, the adorably twisted roguelike/mana…</span>

                              <span>Dragonflight is out on November 28
The time has come for the World of Warcraft pre-Dragonflight expansion patch, much to the delight of lapsed players everywhere. Let&#x27;s talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.
Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the pre-Dragonflight expansion patch:
The talent system has been revamped, and here&#x27;s the biggest change: &quot;Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.&quot;
You can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races
Full UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods
Season 4 ends this week, with a &quot;post-season&quot; lull until the expansion arrives
After all this, the &quot;second phase&quot; of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new God of War), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.
Shadowlands, the current WoW expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with WoW, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (especially when all this came out)...and of course, it was also at a time when Final Fantasy XIV was really, really good. Maybe Dragonflight can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what&#x27;s going to happen.
If you want to dig further, you can find the full patch notes here.

                              <span>Last Friday, the season finale of HBO&#x27;s &quot;House of the Dragon&quot; leaked online, days before the official premiere. One might&#x27;ve expected this to lead to an explosion in piracy traffic, but that&#x27;s not the case. While there was still plenty of interest, most pirates waited for the &#x27;official&#x27; release.

Nor, probably, have you wondered who might “own” a particular color, when you picked it when creating something in Photoshop.

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

It includes a look at all the exclusive bonuses PlayStation players get for playing the game on that platform, too, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.

While those are large, long-coveted features, a new trailer focuses on a couple of smaller additions: two new multiplayer maps, and a new mode, Covert One Flag. And one of the maps looks particularly lovely.

Today, Frontier called the situation &quot;crossed wires&quot;, and said that there are &quot;multiple updates currently in the pipeline, focused on addressing the most important topics raised by the community.&quot;

                              <span>Having recently complained about managing traffic in building games, it is only natural and right that I now praise one that is entirely about managing traffic.
I&#x27;ve had an eye on All Quiet Roads for months, but between Tile Cities and Blink Planets it seemed a bit much to throw this recommendation at you as well. But a game exclusively about the thing I hate most holding my interest this well has to be respected. All Quiet Roads also balances relaxing, freeform play with stressful, occasionally overwhelming challenges, giving it a tonal variety that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting from such a simple concept.

                              <span>Stress Level Zero&#x27;s Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you&#x27;d need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn&#x27;t quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It&#x27;s also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

                              <span>My strongest memory from my 100-hour-long first playthrough of Horizon Zero Dawn was the first time I took on a Thunderjaw. A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I&#x27;d seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: &quot;I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.&quot;
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. &quot;Oh shite. Here we go.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a very big enjoyer of horror games. On the very rare occasion that I do boot up a horror game, a chemical change seems to occur in my body. The part of my brain responsible for going &quot;holy mother of hell get me away from this scary thing&quot; is dampened. I expect to be scared, and therefore I&#x27;m more resilient to said scariness. I might just not be very good at getting into the horror games mindset. My brain is too busy battening down all the hatches and readying the engines of war against the oncoming spookies and ghosties.
The times I&#x27;ve been most scared playing a game are when I don&#x27;t expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

The latest deep dive trailer details the game’s magical parkour abilities that you’ll be using to get across the fantasy realm of Athia. Forspoken’s flashy, stamina-based movement is by far the most distinctive thing about it in my eyes, so let&#x27;s take a look at Frey&#x27;s parkour abilities below.

                              <span>Early last week, I had the opportunity to get hands-on with the demo for The Devil In Me, the upcoming fourth entry and season one finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology. I&#x27;m a big Dark Pictures fan, but had some reservations about this latest outing due to its subject matter, which this time around draws more inspiration from real-life serial killers than supernatural legends. Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

                              <span>I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability. Characters range from mainstream heroes like Hulk and Iron Man to ones I’ve never even heard of, like Ka-Zar or Blue Marvel. At only 12 cards, decks are relatively small, so every character counts. The app is named for the Snap mechanic, w…</span>

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a &quot;soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover.&quot; Using these tiles, you can create a &quot;unique story-multiverse&quot; at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

                              <span>Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you&#x27;re looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese version has been canceled due to the game&#x27;s violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan&#x27;s equivalent to the United States&#x27; ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here&#x27;s what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


&quot;The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you.&quot;

As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

This news comes from a Studio Spotlight blog post by Sony Interactive Entertainment in which the company interviews two London Studio heads: co-studio leaders Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders. The pair discuss their careers and jobs at London Studio, as well as what the team is working on. When asked about the studio&#x27;s next game, Saunders shares some new details about what to expect and the teaser image that you can see below. 
&quot;Our next project is an online co-op combat game, which as you can see here, is set in a modern fantasy London,&quot; Saunders says. &quot;The key thing about this is that it&#x27;s a PlayStation 5 title – it&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>Somerville, the mysterious sci-fi adventure game, finally has a release date and it’s only a few weeks away. The game arrives on November 15. 
The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December&#x27;s Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.</span>

                              <span>Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive Mini II, there&#x27;s a message that reads, &quot;In memory of Rieko Kodama.&quot; Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe&#x27;s tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, &quot;As you understand it. We respected her,&quot; confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama&#x27;s death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family&#x27;s privacy, Sega says. 
&quot;We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,&quot; Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama&#x27;s journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series&#x27; visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega&#x27;s Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama&#x27;s family.</span>

                              <span>I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live.
This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I&#x27;ve never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

                              <span>Today has brought the launch of Signalis, a new retro-styled survival horror about an android trapped in a spooky place in deep space. It looks neat! I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s good! I can neither confirm nor deny that because I can&#x27;t get past the main menu. The background is a big blinking eye, see, and it follows my mouse cursor, so I cannot resist making the eye look around and go silly. I don&#x27;t know how the devs expected players to beat this near-impossible first task of leaving the eye alone long enough to click the &quot;Begin&quot; button.

                              <span>I’ve mentioned before that I’m into survival games with a goal past staying alive, because if surviving is the only goal, what’s the point in living at all (he says, with a firm glare at the Tory party)? Grounded has its main quest and Minecraft has the Ender Dragon, for example, which gives you something to work towards past simply keeping your heart beating. 7 Days to Die is the biggest counterpoint to that, with its routine weekly horde attacks delivering moreish gameplay that keeps me playing way past my bedtime.

                              <span>Wanna get into the Halloween spirit but are a bit of a wimp (100% guilty), or just struggle with horror games in general (1000% guilty)? No worries; I got you. Here&#x27;s a list of the best spooky games for non-horror fans.
Don’t get me wrong, I love Halloween,  I just don’t want to have the bejesus scared outta me, you know? I like games that give me a lil bit of spooky-ookiness, but not like bone-chilling, stomach-churning, nightmare inducing, wont-sleep-for-a-week horror games. Absolutely not. You won’t find any Resident Evil or Silent Hill recommendations here! Feel safe knowing that the spooky-not-scary games you&#x27;ll find below will get you thoroughly into the Halloween mood, just without all the over-the-top violence and buckets of gore. Enjoy!

The news was revealed on Jumpship’s Twitter account with a cryptic logo, and Somerville&#x27;s mysterious vibe is no accident as it comes from Playdead&#x27;s former co-founder Dino Patti, who left the studio after shipping creepy side-on platformers Limbo and Inside.

We&#x27;ve already seen quite a bit about Broken Moon, the brand new map being added with Season 15 - but now Respawn has finally released more details about the new Legend, Catalyst, and the Ferrofluid-powered abilities she brings to the Apex Games.
It turns out that part of Catalyst&#x27;s diverse skillset is an Ultimate ability that may at last provide some serious counterplay to the ever-present scan meta dominated by recon Legends such as Bloodhound and Seer. Take a look at Catalyst&#x27;s abilities in the new Season 15 vignette trailer below.

                              <span>Saturnalia isn&#x27;t a terribly long game, but it has spent much longer occupying my thoughts. Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I&#x27;d heard a strange rattling noise...
In fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they&#x27;re locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.

This week on the Electronic Wireless Show we talk about dread, as in, the thing Matthew feels when confronted with glistening food, or when he knows he has to record a podcast with us. We talk about some cracking scary games, going a bit down the beaten track and away from our normal path of least resistance (talking about Red Dead Redemption 2 and BioWare games). We also have some spooky recommendations for you to spice up your Halloween! Plus, it&#x27;s Nate turn to produce a Cavern Of Lies. More like Cavern Of Jump Scares! And we coin a couple of new euphemisms you&#x27;re sure to work into your every day language.

                              <span>A little while back, I went to Cornwall with some friends in the hopes we&#x27;d detox on lovely beaches and coastal walks. Somehow, we managed a mental cleanse between horrendous downpours that knocked us sideways and made our socks all soggy. And while we cocooned ourselves in metal and waited for these bouts of terrible weather to subside, we played disgusting amounts of Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla.
Over the course of a couple of weeks, we racked up a solid 60+ hours of game time. I&#x27;d wake up and see my friend clearing map markers. I&#x27;d pop out for a quick run (yes, I ran on my holiday like a chump) and return to see both of my friends clearing map markers. Did we enjoy it? Sometimes! But then, why couldn&#x27;t we stop playing? The Ubisoft Effect, I reckon.

Now, Firaxis have confirmed that, yep, Deadpool will be coming to Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, but only as part of its newly unveiled season pass.

                              <span>What&#x27;s better than a little city full of mysteries to solve? A mysterious little city trapped in a time loop, where you slowly learn all the secrets but no one remembers what you did last time around. That&#x27;s The Forgotten City, and if you&#x27;re on Game Pass, I do recommend having a go before it leaves Microsoft&#x27;s service next week. It&#x27;s a great puzzle box running to clockwork, like if Outer Wilds had you meddle with people&#x27;s lives rather than machinery.

                              <span>Game Of Thrones author George R. R. Martin has admitted he hasn’t played Elden Ring, despite creating the history and lore for FromSoftware’s RPG. He does have a fairly good reason for it, though. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Martin said, “I have not played it because people seem to want this Winds Of Winter book,” the (very) long-awaited sixth chapter in the Game Of Thrones series.

                              <span>BioWare have announced, via a blog post by general manager Gary McKay, that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in their fantasy RPG series, has completed its Alpha milestone. If that means nothing to you, BioWare describe it as the moment “a game all comes together… we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end.” The Dragon Age sequel was officially announced in 2018, but it was initially conceived as a game about wizard heists before restarting development. So, Dreadwolf&#x27;s progress should be encouraging to fans of the series.

Our froggy pal has saved a haunted island from the clutches of ghosts, thwarted wizardous party-poopers in Warlock Woods, and now their investigatory prowess has taken him to the wild west. Frog Detective 3: Corruption At Cowboy County may be the last in Worm Club&#x27;s trio of Frog Detective games, but it&#x27;s also a certified banger, successfully joining the first and second games in putting a stupid smile on my face for the entire time I played.

An impressive haul of 48 domains that generated 270 million visits will soon be under ACE ownership, handed over by one man who operated them all. Is that really feasible? Absolutely.

The French streaming portal has relocated to a dedicated domain, hoping to make best use of its clever social media promotions on platforms including TikTok. Unfortunately for Wishflix, these efforts are being frustrated as well.

                              <span>38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it&#x27;s particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that&#x27;s why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let&#x27;s quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it&#x27;s a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one of the top contenders that runs on cheap and widely available AM4 motherboards with DDR4 RAM. Earlier this week we covered a deal for the 5800X3D in the US, and now we&#x27;re back to finish the job with a deal for the UK market. 
Right now Ebuyer are taking orders for the 5800X3D at £349, a solid £110 discount from its UK RRP. A lot of folks have already jumped on this deal, using up Ebuyer&#x27;s existing stock, but you can order now for delivery on October 31st - and get a spooky Halloween upgrade for your PC.

                              <span>Hello again. Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the second one) is out in full, not just its campaign, I’ve revisited my best settings guide to see whether it can provide a preset-beating balance of looks and performance in the multiplayer component as well. And it does! If anything the various online modes tend to run more smoothly and consistently than the singleplayer story, but whichever you prefer playing, you can make just a few key changes to visibly improve your frames per second. And a COD with more frames just feels better.
Despite this universal truth, MW2 can be a toughie on older PC hardware: even graphics cards listed among the recommended system requestions need quality cuts to get a stable 60fps at 1080p. In this guide I’ll be showing you how various GPUs perform and where, precisely, the make those cuts if needed.

                              <span>I’m fairly sure that zombies are the perfect video game enemies. They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I&#x27;ve put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have the greatest understanding of how one is meant to play a real-time strategy game as a child. It wasn&#x27;t a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I&#x27;d had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I&#x27;d amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I&#x27;d tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

The team describe Nightmare as a “mind-shattering extradimensional take on the classic CoD zombies formula” with some emotional baggage on the side. Essentially, it’s a horror FPS that has you up against vampires, werewolves, and angels (the bad kind) across six biomes. This bite-sized FPS acts as a companion piece to next year’s El Paso, Elsewhere, the previously announced third-person shooter

The “full-fledged” remake of 2007’s RPG is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and will use the same toolsets that CDPR is creating for their upcoming Witcher trilogy. The studio call the project a “modern reimagining” and say they’re “updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it.”

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of talking about The Callisto Protocol this year, starting with the game&#x27;s gore system and spiky walls at Summer Geoff Fest, before finding out its Die Hard and Shaun Of The Dead inspirations at Gamescom. In-between all the talking? Lots of slides and presentations and absolutely no hands anywhere near controllers. But finally, finally, I&#x27;ve played a 90-minute PS5 demo of The Callisto Protocol and can confirm that it felt like a last-gen game in a good way: all photorealistic sweat and blood scrawled on walls, coupled with 360-era exploration and fighting. Refreshingly familiar, I&#x27;d say.

                              <span>To celebrate Fallout&#x27;s 25th anniversary this week, Amazon Prime Video have released the first official glimpse of their upcoming Fallout TV show. Amazon posted a screengrab from the show on Twitter last night, depicting three Vault 33 dwellers staring at a silhouette coming in or out of the Vault - and what appears to be a body lying on the ground beside them. This is the first and only proper look we&#x27;ve had at the adaptation since August’s leaked set images mysteriously disappeared from the internet, but that hasn’t stopped fans from wildly theorising about what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>After the past three years, I’d have happily never heard the word &quot;plague&quot; again, let alone in the context of one of my favourite co-op games. Yet after an early play around with Deep Rock Galactic Season 3, I’m already sold that this update – which centers around a corrupting, planet-wide infection – could be its best one yet.
After repelling a robot-spamming rival corp across Seasons 1 and 2, your reward in Season 3 – which launches on November 3rd – is to find your mining operating pelted by a meteorite storm. And they’re carrying a nasty payload: Rockpox, a contagion that quickly infects both the caves of Hoxxes IV and the many, many giant bugs living within them. These sickly Glyphids and contaminated caverns will present you and your fellow space dwarves with some new perils, but also new opportunities to turn a management-pleasing profit. And isn’t providing value to shareholders why we’re all here to begin with?

Still, this is science, and I respect the process. Next up, I am asking you to choose between two things which, if we&#x27;re honest with ourselves, are both really about trying to be cool.

It’s what should be scary about zombies when they’re not just mindless headshot fodder. This is also the main fear behind Endoparasitic, a top-down horror game released earlier this week. A research facility suffers a parasitic outbreak, leaving you with one arm, surrounded by mutated monsters. Oh, and you’re also infected by one of those deadly parasites I just mentioned. Jolly!

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s campaign may be the best it&#x27;s been for a long while. There&#x27;s great variety in the game&#x27;s first-person shooty bang with plenty of interesting ideas to break the illusion of it being an on-the-rails ride. Where it excels is in its action movie sequences, but it also takes itself too seriously at times and struggles to balance the sensitivities of conflict within its choppy story.

The rebuttal admits that using popular artists to showcase its technology wasn&#x27;t smart so the references have been removed. However, the services themselves are not infringing. In fact, one of the core algorithms is created and publicly shared by  Deezer.

In response, an impressive 15% decided to go legal, but others weren&#x27;t so readily converted. Close to half migrated to other pirate sites, with around 12% of blocked pirates deploying VPNs or modified DNS settings.

                              <span>Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio&#x27;s upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they&#x27;re leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line.

                              <span>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red announced that it was developing a new Cyberpunk game, multiple Witcher games, and a new IP. One of those Witcher games was given the codename &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; and CDPR called it a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool&#x27;s Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool&#x27;s Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur&#x27;s Gate III, and Outriders.

                              <span>Team Ninja has revealed the release date for its upcoming action game set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and it&#x27;s less than half a year away. 
More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That&#x27;s less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let&#x27;s break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition
The steelbook launch edition of the game will include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a collector&#x27;s steelbook (yet to be revealed), and the Crown of Zhurong and Crown of Gonggong bonus DLC. It will also include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Digital Deluxe Edition
The digital deluxe edition will include a digital copy of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a digital art book, a digital mini soundtrack, and the game&#x27;s season pass. It will also include the Quinglong armor as a season pass bonus, the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus, and the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus. 
DLC
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will have a season pass and it will include three pieces of DLC, although Team Ninja has not detailed what to expect just yet. You can also buy these DLCs individually. Anyone that purchases the season pass will get the Qinglong armor as a bonus.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 processors are brilliant, often beating Intel 12th-gen offerings and drawing close with 13th-gen, while offering support for PCIe 5.0 SSDs, DDR5 RAM and a brand new AM5 socket. For content creation, they&#x27;re by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. 
Pound for pound, it&#x27;s by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it&#x27;s been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That&#x27;s a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides.

                              <span>Today marks the 25th anniversary of strategy classic Age Of Empires, and to celebrate Xbox Game Studios have announced a ream of updates coming to Age Of Empires II: Definitive Edition next year. Technically, the main bit of news from tonight&#x27;s anniversary stream is that both Age Of Empires II: DE and Age Of Empires IV will be arriving on Xbox consoles in 2023 (that, and Age Of Mythology is coming back), but the upshot of all that is that the PC versions will be getting the very same benefits, including controller support, crossplay with consoles and cloud gaming support.

                              <span>Shareware platformers defined my PC gaming as a kid. Yeah, a cheeky blast on Wolfenstein 3D was okay, but Commander Keen and Duke Nukem were an amazing discovery for a small person who’d been introduced to games through the NES. One of my all-time favourites is Apogee’s Crystal Caves, a gem of a platformer about an interstellar miner who goes space spelunking in search of alien crystals.

                              <span>Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.
If you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you&#x27;re looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam&#x27;s done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.

                              <span>It’s been two years since developer Origame Digital released the beloved photography game Umurangi Generation and since then, the team have been relatively quiet. That all changed over the weekend when Umurangi’s composer, ThorHighHeels, posted a YouTube video showcasing three obscure horror games. A short teaser for Origame’s FiveSeven was mysteriously tucked in the middle of it.

                              <span>Last week I reviewed New Tales From The Borderlands and I really didn&#x27;t like it. This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don&#x27;t want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).
As it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I&#x27;m not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I&#x27;d sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn&#x27;t played it for a while. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t how I remembered. Maybe I&#x27;d changed, you know?

                              <span>When Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, first played the Age Of Empires series, he was still working at Westwood Studios on Command &amp; Conquer. “The first thing I was impressed about more than anything with this series was just like, wow! History! That&#x27;s really smart,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Like, there&#x27;s no need to explain anything to people. You don&#x27;t have to be like, oh, there&#x27;s a laser gun or this is a magic missile. It&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”


To Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it&#x27;s just outlasted everything else.”

Back in January, FromSoftware deactivated online features for the Dark Souls trilogy on PC due to the prominence of hackers and security concerns. Recently, Dark Souls III servers were reactivated (before being deactivated and reactivated again) and now it&#x27;s Dark Souls II’s turn. The base version of Dark Souls II will have these features “made available at a later date,&quot; but for now, Scholar Of The First Sin players can continue to invade the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and scribble down messages for others.

                              <span>The Activision Blizzard King Workers Alliance have teamed up with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union to file another charge of unfair labour practices against Activision Blizzard. The filing is in response to a message described as anti-union that was sent by Activision Blizzard’s communications executive, Lulu Meservey, to 18,000 employees last week. The CWA had previously filed a charge of unfair labour practices in September 2021, accusing the company of violating US labour laws and stopping employees from discussing working conditions. Last year’s complaint was closed just a month later.

                              <span>EA held their first Behind The Sims Summit last week, revealing plenty of Sims updates, including a very early look at the next game in the series, Project Rene. Despite this big news, discussion around the event has focused on EA’s lack of community representation, as they only included one “black simmer” onscreen during a stream full of other content creators. Black content creators have been a significant part of The Sims&#x27; online presence for years, creating custom content, mods and more.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a &quot;gonzo, crazy, funny adventure&quot; and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>The Age of Empires series is coming to Xbox; well, some of it at least. 
More specifically, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, the 2019 remaster of the original 1999 Age of Empires II release, is coming to Xbox consoles on January 31, 2023, and it will be followed by an Xbox release of Age of Empires IV later that year. This news came alongside various Age of Empires-related news announced today as part of the series&#x27; 25th Anniversary celebrations. 
Check out the announcement video for yourself below: 


That&#x27;s not all that was revealed today, though. If you&#x27;re an Age of Empires fiend, check out this video breaking down the history of the series that the Xbox and the Age of Empires team released today: 


Xbox, World&#x27;s Edge, and Relic Entertainment have also revealed Age of Mythology Retold, a definitive edition of the Age of Empires spin-off series first released in 2002. Check out its reveal trailer below: 


&quot;Age of Mythology Retold is in production,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;We know that the Age of Mythology community has been waiting hopefully for a Definitive Edition, and we&#x27;ll be delivering. We&#x27;re working hard to bring you the glory of the original game with updated graphics, features, and more.&quot; 
Next up is the reveal that Age of Empires is heading to mobile devices. Not much was revealed, but you can check out the teaser trailer for the game below:

                              <span>A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

                              <span>Bethesda revealed Arkane Studios&#x27; open-world, co-op FPS Redfall back in 2021, and since then, the companies have been slowly pulling back the curtain on what to expect in this vampire-infested experience. We&#x27;ve received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we&#x27;ve even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new &quot;Into The Night&quot; Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there&#x27;s a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today&#x27;s trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it&#x27;d be such a great Halloween game – but it&#x27;s not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it&#x27;s released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s third chapter, it&#x27;s operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they&#x27;re running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It&#x27;s loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin&#x27; and hollerin&#x27; the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you&#x27;re staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…</span>

                              <span>Cult of the Lamb was released back in August and while the main story will run you a dozen or so hours, developer Massive Monsters are inviting you back to your base of operations with a new Blood Moon Festival update that&#x27;s now live. 
This limited-time event began yesterday (October 24) and will run until November 10. It brings plenty of new with it, too, so you&#x27;ll want to jump in to check out all of the Blood Moon&#x27;s offerings before it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s what to expect:
New Blood Moon Ritual
3 New Follower Forms to unlock
4 Base Decorations to unlock
New music track
To accompany the news, Massive Monsters have also released a new trailer for Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Blood Moon Festival update that you can watch below: 


&quot;Under the light of the Blood Moon, devotees can harvest pumpkins to unlock a brand new ritual that will raise former members of their cult, casting them back to the land of the living as wandering spirits,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;New follower forms and dreadful decorations will be granted upon their capture, but be quick about it, the Blood Moon will wane on November 10.&quot;

                              <span>One of Overwatch&#x27;s most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game&#x27;s loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year&#x27;s event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game&#x27;s Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

&quot;Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,&quot; a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. &quot;Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o&#x27;-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.&quot; 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

                              <span>A post from the popular weblog Boing Boing is at the center of a new dispute in the piracy trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande. The dated article contains allegations of extortion-like business practices by piracy-tracking outfit Rightscorp. The music companies label the blog as an unreliable &quot;pro-piracy&quot; source. Grande, meanwhile, notes that the article was valuable enough to be documented by Warner&#x27;s anti-piracy expert.

It originally debuted at $1000, undercutting the RTX 3090 Ti at $1500, but third-party models could cost much more - such as this $1200 PowerColor Red Devil. Today though, with that whole &#x27;impending release of better graphics cards&#x27; thing, the 6950 XT is down to $800 at Amazon, which is an awesome deal for the level of graphics performance on offer.

                              <span>Folks, I’ve got some bad news. Victoria 3 is not a game where you play the clone of the clone of Posh Spice. I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.
Trying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.

                              <span>The Corsair 5000D is a rather good PC case, but as it&#x27;s fairly new it&#x27;s normally quite expensive - like $165 on Amazon expensive. So it brings me good cheer to announce that Woot are doing the case in white or black for just $99.99, the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model.

The Federal Court previously issued orders targeting IPTV and NHL streaming sources and last week, a new piracy-blocking order was handed down. It requires local ISPs to prevent subscribers from accessing pirated streams of the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

                              <span>PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games&#x27; &quot;immoral&quot; compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor&#x27;s original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor&#x27;s thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels &quot;the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry&quot; since &quot;some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger.&quot;

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication.

The popular Game of Thrones prequel was already quite popular among pirates and this release is drawing even more attention. The source of the leak is unclear but the Hebrew subtitles could be a hint.

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more. 
Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a gr…</span>
