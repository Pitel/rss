                              <span>Diablo 4&#x27;s best new endgame addition, The Pit, is a twist on Diablo 3&#x27;s Greater Rift formula. These procedural, randomized dungeons reward you with the items necessary for masterworking gear, so they&#x27;re essential if you want to push a build to its limits. You&#x27;ll just need one thing before you head in: Runeshards. 


It takes three Runeshards to enter the Pit at any tier, so stockpiling these should be in the back of your mind while doing other content. They drop from Nightmare Dungeons of tier 46 or higher, Tree of Whispers Caches, Legion Events, and World Bosses. As for farming these, here&#x27;s my preferred method.


Farming Runeshards in Diablo 4

The quickest way I&#x27;ve found to farm Runeshards is to blitz through the lowest Nightmare Dungeon tier that drops them: tier 46. At the Occultist, you can craft Nightmare Dungeon Sigils of varying levels, which works (almost) perfectly for our farming method. 


To get started, simply craft level 41-50 Sigils and save the ones between 46 and 50 while salvaging the rest. As you complete these dungeons, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with Sigils of similar quality. If you&#x27;re blasting even higher Nightmare Dungeons, go ahead and do those so you can level you Paragon Glyphs quicker as well.


One tier 46 Nightmare Dungeon nets you the three Runeshards you&#x27;ll need for a single Pit run. If you get burnt out on dungeons, you can try blasting the Helltide for a bit and completing the Tree of Whispers bounties inside for a cache that will also net you at least three Runeshards. If you alternate these activities while keeping an eye on Legion and World Boss timers, you&#x27;ll have a stockpile of shards before you know it.

Anger Foot comes to us from Free Lives, a developer whose work has brought us a varied portfolio that includes games like Broforce, Genital Jousting, and Terra Nil. It’s coming sometime later this year, but I got to plant my feet in it today. Or, recently, I guess. What day is it?

Ascending party members is vital as you progress and if you want to survive tougher fights, as it allows you to level up characters and increase their stats. Remember that, once you&#x27;ve ascended your party members and increased their maximum level, you’ll also need to make sure that their weapons are also leveled up.

Terraspawn Fungus is found only in the area around the Withering Frontline in Desorock Highland. It’s pretty common in the area, alongside Erodorchid, which look fairly similar. 


Fair warning, this area is completely overrun with Tacet Discords and it’s unlikely you’ll be able to sneak around the area unnoticed. The TDs seem particularly prevalent in areas where there are clumps of Terraspawn Fungus, so you’ll need to be prepared to fight if you want to farm this material. 


On top of this, Terraspawn Fungus spawns in the area directly on top of the location where you fight the Overlord class Thundering Memphis, so you’ll need to err on the side of caution if you don’t want to be dragged into a battle.

Terraspawn Fungus can also be purchased by visiting Shifang Pharmacy in Jinzhou. This can get pretty expensive, however, especially for something that can be found pretty easily in the wild. 


However, if you’re in a pinch, or find that you’re just a few short when it comes time to ascend, you can purchase a maximum of 15 Terraspawn Fungus for 3,000 Shell Credits each. You&#x27;ll need to wait for a timer to reset to get more.

Where to find Coriolus in Wuthering Waves


Screenshot by Destructoid


Coriolus is a type of fungus in Wuthering Waves and, as such, can usually be found growing on cliffs and rocky outcrops across the map. Although Coriolus can sporadically be found in any location, the highest concentration of this material is in the Dim Forest, particularly inside the Forbidden Forest. 


To get your hands on it, you’ll likely have to do some climbing and, rather than keeping your eyes on the ground, make sure to move your camera around to see what’s growing on the cliff edges. 


There aren’t any bigger enemies to worry about around the area, but there are a lot of groups of Tacet Discords and a fair few Exiles who will attack if you get too close.

Assault rifles can do a little bit of everything. This class has weapons capable of taking down enemies in short, medium, and long-range engagements. Being able to kill faster, having a manageable recoil pattern, and having good mobility separate these four choices. With that in mind, let&#x27;s jump right into the list.

Critical Countdown is Season 4&#x27;s first event, taking place across MW3 multiplayer, Warzone, and Zombies. As always, players have a series of challenges to complete to unlock cosmetic items, with the top prize coming as the World Ender blueprint. 


Each challenge requires you to collect DNA Samples, so they will prove to be a critical part of this season. If you fancy unlocking all the rewards, here&#x27;s how to get them.

How to collect DNA Samples


Collecting DNA Samples is easy as enemies and friendlies both drop them when killed. Your teammates will drop the Ade sample, while opponents drop the Cyto sample. This is important as these samples unlock different rewards. 


There are two more DNA Samples yet to unlock too, which are linked to different Mastery Challenges, all of which need to be completed before you unlock the World Ender blueprint. 


If you&#x27;re looking to grab them as quickly as possible, I would suggest playing Small Map Moshpit, as you&#x27;ll find yourself in plenty of gunfights, and the maps aren&#x27;t too big either. This means you&#x27;ll be able to collect plenty of samples just while playing normally, and it won&#x27;t affect how you play too much. 


Don&#x27;t worry though, as you&#x27;ve got until June 26 to complete this challenge, so don&#x27;t panic if you can&#x27;t get to it this weekend. Just make sure you do it before the timer runs out.

It doesn’t matter how powerful you get in Wuthering Waves, the enemies scale up with you as you level, so you&#x27;re never going to be overleveled.

                              <span>The Trivela shot remains a powerful option for players to score those clutch goals in EA FC 24, despite the nerfs in the last few months.


The Trivela is quite different from traditional shots, as the player kicks the ball with the outside part of a footballer&#x27;s foot. Naturally, this completely changes the trajectory and angle of the shot. While a traditional shot moves towards the arms of the goalkeeper, an outside foot shot travels away.


How do you perform a Trivela shot in EA FC 24?


There are a lot of advanced shooting techniques in EA FC 24, and some of them are pretty hard to perform. The Trivela, on the contrary, is relatively simple. There are specific points you need to remember while lining up the shot, but it&#x27;s a lot easier to do compared to the likes of the Power Shot or Bi…</span>

Banana is a different thing, because as far as in-game events go, nothing happens beyond seeing the counter that tells you how many times you&#x27;ve clicked on the banana — or on the screen, really — go up a number.

                              <span>Getting a full set of Echoes worth using in Wuthering Waves is incredibly difficult due to all of the RNG involved. You might consider using off-set pieces to create a build, but is that really worth your time?


One look at one of the Echo sets in Wuthering Waves, and you&#x27;ll probably think it&#x27;s mandatory to build a full set thanks to powerful the set bonuses. However, to make a character viable and function at a high level, you should consider off-set pieces only before grinding out a full set — let&#x27;s get to the why.

                              <span>Can anyone even remember what vanilla Skyrim looks like? I think we&#x27;ve all collectively decided that what Bethesda released all those years ago is a far cry from what many of us experience today, thanks to the near-endless array of mods we can install.


No one in the modding community seems more dedicated to improving The Elder Scrolls 5 than JaySerpa. Ever keen to inject a bit more immersion, this time they&#x27;re bringing us an expansion of one of the more interesting side quests.




In the base game, &quot;Destroy the Dark Brotherhood&quot; does exactly what it says on the tin, in that it tasks you with killing the merry band of murderers that dwell within the assassins&#x27; Sanctuary. In this updated version from JaySerpa, however, a few additional things have been added, presumably to give the standard mission a bit of umph.


Improves the &#x27;lackluster&#x27; original


As the description on Nexus Mods says:



This mod introduces new lore-friendly ways to get kidnapped by Astrid (allowing you to Destroy the Dark Brotherhood even after sparing Grelod) while also expanding the actual quest to destroy the DB with new dialogue, choices, more memorable fights and a more cohesive quest. Enjoy!




It essentially implements two things by giving you an alternative way to meet the Brotherhood without having to kill Grelod the Kind, while also making &quot;Destroy...&quot; itself a bit longer. It does this by not giving you the password to the Sanctuary immediately, meaning you have to seek it out. The mod also comes with new voices, which have either been spliced from vanilla dialogue or has been recorded.


Basically, it&#x27;s one more reason why people keep playing Skyrim. So long as there are mods out there that expand or improve upon the 2011 release, we&#x27;re going to keep seeing TES5 in the gaming limelight. The Elder Scrolls 6 is seriously going to have to do a lot of work to match this kind of legacy.

                              <span>Blizzard has announced its beta for the next World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within, is just around the corner. While it&#x27;s still a closed beta, there are ways for eager players to jump in when it begins on June 5. 


According to Blizzard&#x27;s latest announcement, invites go out to veteran players, fansites, press, friends, and family soon. Additionally, anyone who pre-orders the Epic edition of The War Within will also have immediate Beta access. It&#x27;s not the cheapest route, but if you&#x27;re interested in being a part of the feedback for the full release, this is the best way to guarantee it.

If you&#x27;re lucky enough to be selected, you&#x27;ll receive an email to your Battle.net account address telling you so. You can then download the beta directly from the Blizzard launcher. Remember that Phishing attempts are common around betas, so always check the official sources before clicking on anything in an email.


As for what&#x27;s available in the beta, you&#x27;ll have access to the following:



Leveling to cap


Hero Talents


All available zones


4 leveling dungeons and 4 max-level dungeons


Delves - new instances that can be completed solo or with friends


Warbands, read more about here


The Earthen playable race


All other new systems



The new expansion is fast approaching and is expected to arrive sometime in late summer or autumn. The War Within is the start of a three-expansion series, The World Soul Saga, which promises to be a massive culmination of the Warcraft storyline.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to believe Diablo 4 is coming up on its one-year anniversary, but much easier to believe that its ill-fated predecessor, Diablo Immortal, is almost two. Regardless, D4 players are being treated to some free shop cosmetics, loot goblins galore, and the return of the hearty Mother&#x27;s Blessing experience buff, detailed over in a blog post on Blizzard&#x27;s website.


March of the Goblins and free shop items


The first &quot;part&quot; of the event runs from June 6 to 13 and harkens the March of the Goblins, as well as a chance to choose some free new cosmetics found in the game&#x27;s shop. The influx of Treasure Goblins means more greed shrines, Treasure Goblins that appear in pairs (or large packs), and bigger loot drops when they&#x27;re killed


The blog post seems to allude to the fact that the free shop items will be selectable, one at a time, over the period of June 6 to 12, with all of them available to claim until June 20. I assume this means you&#x27;ll be able to select as many items as days have passed since the 6th until you&#x27;re able to grab them all. They appear to be a modest selection of items pulled from bundles purchasable in the shop, but forgive me if my knowledge of in-game purchases is a bit lacking. You can check out a preview of the items in the image below:





Mother&#x27;s Blessing: Anniversary Edition


The fan-favorite buff that grants a 25% boost to experience and 50% boost to earned gold is making a return for a whopping 10 days during the celebration. No exact start date appears to be set, but it&#x27;ll probably kick off around the end of the first part of the anniversary event. Gold costs have been a major sticking point this season with the introduction of Masterworking, so a boost is going to more than welcome to those looking to min-max their loadouts.

                              <span>Call of Duty&#x27;s free-to-play battle royale Warzone has truly dominated the genre since its release, but do you need an Xbox Live subscription to play it? If you don&#x27;t currently pay for one, the answer will be music to your ears.


When I was growing up, the idea of a free-to-play multiplayer game was rare, as most required you to not only buy the game, but have an active Xbox Live Gold subscription. I still remember begging my mum to buy me an Xbox Live card in our local Game so I could keep playing CoD4 with my mates. 


Now, things are different, and if you don&#x27;t currently have a subscription, or if Warzone is literally the only game you play, then there&#x27;s some good news for you.

Is Xbox Live required to play Warzone?


No, you do not need to have an active Xbox Live subscription to play Warzone on your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S. 


You will need to have an active internet connection though, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to play if your console isn&#x27;t hooked up to the worldwide web. If you try that, you&#x27;ll be met with an error and spend your time looking at menus without ever jumping out of the plane. 


If you have your internet connection hooked in, simply open up the Call of Duty app on your console, select Warzone, and jump into a match. Please note though that this only works for Warzone and not Modern Warfare 3, which you will need an Xbox Live subscription to play online.

If you loved 2018&#x27;s God of War, then you may, like me, find it hard to imagine a sequel improving the game. Somehow, however, Ragnarok manages to take what was great about the game and make it even better. 


While Ragnarok was released on PlayStation consoles in 2022, we&#x27;re now finally getting a PC launch for those who don&#x27;t own a PS4 or PS5, and let me tell you, if you haven&#x27;t played it yet, it is definitely worth the wait.

God of War Ragnarok PC release date


God of War Ragnarok will be released on PC on Thursday, September 19, 2024. This was confirmed during the May 30 State of Play, and will include the Valhalla DLC too so you can get the full GoW experience. 


God of War Ragnarok PC release countdown


If you&#x27;re excited for the PC release of Ragnarok, and want to know how long you have to wait to get your hands on it, we&#x27;ve put together this countdown timer to help you out. As we don&#x27;t know the exact release time, we&#x27;ve set it to midnight EST for now, and will update it when we get more information. 



Now if only we had information about the next God of War game, that would make me very happy.

                              <span>The next phase of the Monster Hunter series is beginning to kick off with the PlayStation State of Play&#x27;s Monster Hunter Wilds trailer. In it, we get a few breathtaking cinematics and a first look into gameplay.




Prepare for an adrenaline-pumping adventure as the trailer introduces a host of formidable monsters. The first battle showcases a massive bear-like creature, promising a challenging boss fight. The reptilian adversaries are equally menacing, adding even more formidable showdowns.


Monster Hunter&#x27;s classic combat still holds true in this next iteration, where we see the brutality of a gun first-hand. And, of course, there needed to be at least one gigantic sword, as one of the characters deals a deadly blow to the creature.


Unfortunately, we didn&#x27;t get an exact release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, as the trailer only depicted cinematics and gameplay. However, we do know that it is slated for 2025 at least, and wishlists are currently available.


Similar to past iterations, Monster Hunter Wilds has you hunting down for, you guessed it, monsters. Given that it&#x27;s in the wilds, the environment will change constantly. That means extra challenges are ahead, bringing out unique wildlife across the Forbidden Lands.


For those who have journeyed with the series in the past, Wilds brings a wealth of new moves, weapons, and equipment to master. Get ready to explore fresh strategies and unleash devastating attacks with these exciting additions.


While we eagerly await an official release date, one thing is certain: Monster Hunter Wilds will be a multi-platform adventure. You can look forward to embarking on this thrilling hunt on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in 2025.

                              <span>Developer Survios debuted the first gameplay trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. The VR single-player action-horror game focuses on an all-new storyline in the Alien universe as they try to survive an encounter with the &quot;Perfect Organism&quot; in VR.




Built in Unreal Engine 5, Alien: Rogue Incursion utilizes the power of VR to drop players into an intense action-horror environment as they try to survive and outsmart the Alien with shooter-style gameplya and mechanics as they explore an Alien-infested facility on the harsh planet of Purdan.


Alien: Isolation is still one of my favorite horror titles of all time, so if Rogue Incursion can manage to channel even a fraction of that I&#x27;ll be happy. Besides, Isolationfelt like a perect transition into VR so this could very well be a perfect match.


Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to release this Holiday 2024 on PlayStation VR2, PCVR via Steam, and Meta Quest 3.

                              <span>The father-son duo Kratos and Atreus are back and better than ever in the upcoming God of War Ragnarok PC release, which will launch on Sept. 19, 2024.


At the PlayStation State of Play 2024 showcase, it was revealed that the game&#x27;s PC spec will harness the power of NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XESS 1.3. This cutting-edge technology, combined with &quot;unlocked frame rates&quot; and &quot;super ultrawide support,&quot; ensures an extraordinary gaming experience.




You can also play the Valhalla DLC, which will be a part of the PC release, to get more bang for your buck. In this story, you&#x27;ll experience the journey of Kratos and Atreus as they explore the Nine Realms. The action-adventure game unravels the secrets within Ragnarok&#x27;s profound lore, which is heavily tied to Greek mythology.


I&#x27;ve pleasantly enjoyed seeing the God of War franchise take off over the years. I remember the old PS2 days when Kratos was just a brute with a large weapon. Now, he&#x27;s become a loving father to show off his more sentimental side. It&#x27;s not something I quite expected, but it&#x27;s welcomed, nonetheless. 


Now that the God of War Ragnarok PC release is on its way, I&#x27;m curious to see when the next entry will debut. But for now, make sure to mark your calendars for its Sept. 19, 2024 debut.

                              <span>PlayStation&#x27;s unofficial mascot, at least in my eyes, is back for his own big adventure. Astro Bot is a fully fledged new game starring the rambunctious little bot, and it arrives on PlayStation 5 on September 6, 2024.


Previously starring in games like Astro Bot Rescue Mission for Sony&#x27;s VR headset and in the fantastic launch title Astro&#x27;s Playroom for the PS5, Astro Bot gives Team Asobi&#x27;s little fella a game all his own. Granted, it looks like he&#x27;ll still be platforming around, meeting famous Sony characters, and utilizing PlayStation tech from throughout the console lineup&#x27;s history.




We can expect more than 50 worlds to explore, which is a substantial amount of Astro Bot to dig into. But if it remains as charming and fun as the previous games, this might be a big-hitter for Sony. At least in today&#x27;s trailer, shown off during the Sony State of Play, we can see plenty of fun levels and interesting gameplay moments, including flying a giant PlayStation 5 into space.


It will have to carry the weight either way, as today&#x27;s State of Play was a little short on other major Sony reveals. Concord feels like it&#x27;s already off to a rough start after its official unveiling, and other games felt like they only got small updates, with several major games like Monster Hunter Wilds still aiming for 2025 rather than 2024.


I believe in Astro Bot, though. He&#x27;s quickly become a favorite face of mine in the Sony roster, and this new entry looks delightful. If nothing else, I have a hopefully solid platformer to look forward to on September 6.

                              <span>As part of the PlayStation State of Play stream, Konami and Bloober Team have given us a deeper look at the remake of Silent Hill 2. It focuses mostly on Angela Orosco, as well as some pretty familiar-looking scenes from the game. More importantly, we have a release date of October 8, 2024.


I think it looks decent. What do you think? Here’s the trailer:




There’s a lot that’s really familiar being shown off. It looks to me like Bloober Team are trying very hard to keep it as close to the original as they can while making modern changes. However, it doesn’t really matter how careful they are; they’re working on an extremely beloved game, and not everyone is going to love it.


Frankly, I think Silent Hill 2 is a great game, but I’m not huge on it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fantastic, I’m just not totally enthusiastic. I don’t think a remake is really going to change that, but I’m open to the possibility.


Silent Hill 2 (the remake) is out on October 8, 2024 for PS5 and PC.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s May 30 2024 State of Play, developer Firewalk Studios detailed its upcoming 5v5 PvP-focused FPS called Concord. Originally revealed in 2023, this is the first concrete details we&#x27;ve seen about Concord since. After starting with a nearly 5-minute long cinematic trailer that gave massive Guardians of the Galaxy vibes, we got a roughly 2-minute long gameplay trailer that looked a lot like Overwatch.




Players take on the role of a Freegunner and join their teammates to take on rival Freegunner crews in space heists across six different 5v5 PvP modes that take places on a variety of planets and exotic maps on those planets. There seems to be some pretty interesting variety between the characters, but the genre feels so overdone at this point I can&#x27;t help but wonder if Concord is a bit late to the party.


Concord is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive but will also launch on PC, though despite the recent Helldivers 2 fiasco, Concord will in fact require a PlayStation Network account to be played on PC. Those interested in taking on the role of a Freegunner and jumping into the 5v5 PvP gameplay will have the opportunity to do so when the Early Access beta drops on June 6, 2024, with the full release scheduled for August 23, 2024.

                              <span>Fashion lovers, there&#x27;s a new adventure on the horizon for you on PlayStation. The open-world dress-up game Infinity Nikki is hosting a test in Q3 on PlayStation 5.


Shown off during the PlayStation State of Play today, Infinity Nikki is a dress-up adventure game where you&#x27;ll need the abilities of different outfits to go on your journey. Also, there&#x27;s an adorable cat companion.




Reader, I&#x27;ll be the first to tell you, I don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s up with this series, other than the way I&#x27;ve heard those knowledgeable in it talk about the games with reverence. I do trust those people, and so I will say, this looks good! The lighting and designs are gorgeous, and it feels like there are probably some mysteries lurking under the surface.


Any more than that, and you&#x27;ll probably be better served by signing up for the Q3 test. If you want to master the power of style, best to keep an eye on the Infinity Nikki socials for information about the upcoming hands-on opportunity.

                              <span>During the Playstation State of Play Stream, Omega Force has announced a new game in the Dynasty Warriors series. Finally. Dynasty Warriors Origins. It’s pretty shiny-looking, and it’s coming in 2015.


I don’t know what else to say about it. There’s a bajillion dudes on screen, a “nameless hero” cuts through them with a variety of weapons. Here’s the trailer:




The last Dynasty Warriors game came out back in 2018, so we’ve been due. In between those years, we got a bunch of (sometimes awesome) spin-offs. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Houses was 2022, and I thought it was pretty good. Will be nice to play one on shinier hardware, though.


Dynasty Warrior Origins is coming in 2025. The only confirmed platform so far is PS5.

Like with most unlockables in Hades 2, Weapon Aspects become available after receiving the right incantation. In this case, the &#x27;Aspects of Night and Darkness&#x27; incantation is the one you should be gunning for. It&#x27;s offered to you by Hecate, but not freely; you&#x27;ll have to prove you earned it first.



Hades 2: How to unlock Aspects for main weapons


It&#x27;ll take time to unlock Weapon Aspects in Hades 2. In my experience, I didn&#x27;t get the incantation until I was roughly 20 hours into the game and had seen most of the available Regions. The …</span>

After being revealed at last year&#x27;s Gamescom Opening Night Live with a 2024 date attached, Little Nightmares III has today been delayed to 2025.
The announcement from developer Supermassive Games and publisher Bandai Namco Europe stated that the delay has been made so that the team can &quot;give the game the care and love it deserves&quot;. No specific date has been provided at the moment, though the announcement does say that we can expect to hear more news on the horror platformer &quot;later this summer&quot;.

Prominent leaker Midori (みどり) seems to have been giving Pyoro a run for their money recently, leaking details of unannounced gaming projects from multiple publishers, including Nintendo.
However, rather than outright hinting at upcoming announcements, Midori is putting more focus on project codenames. So while we may be getting a view of potential games in development over at Nintendo, we (and Midori, it seems) are currently unable to definitively confirm what these relate to.

As Nintendo&#x27;s internal software focus has switched to games for its as-yet-unannounced hardware, we&#x27;ve been enjoying a wave of lower-key ports, remakes, and remasters over the last year or so, in addition to the tentpole TOTKs and Mario Wonders of the world. The sun may be slowly setting on Switch, but quality revisits such as Metroid Prime Remastered, Super Mario RPG, and Paper Mario: TTYD hardly feel like stop-gaps. Even less exciting games like Mario vs. Donkey Kong and the upcoming Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD represent hearty late-gen fare, especially for players who never played the originals.
Still, if you are a returning player, you might be looking at the price tag for these games and raising an eyebrow. Nintendo has said in the past that it looks at pricing on a &quot;case-by-case&quot; basis, so here&#x27;s a look at the MSRP of all the recent Switch remasters/remakes/ports it&#x27;s published since the beginning of 2023:

                              <span>Event starts today.
The latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet 7-Star Tera Raid Battle event has gotten underway today, finally giving players the chance to catch a Swampert (thanks, Serebii.net).
The fully-evolved Gen III starter doesn&#x27;t usually show its face in Paldean encounters — though you can grab a Mudkip thanks to the Indigo Disk DLC&#x27;s Blueberry Academy addition, of course — so this is a good chance to snatch one up.

Last year, during the Marvelous Games Showcase, the company revealed it was working on the next major entry in the farming and lifestyle simulation series Story of Seasons.
Now during this year&#x27;s showcase, the Story of Seasons series manager Hikaru Nakano has provided a development update and another look at the project. The brief video reveals fireworks, a glider, updated natural lighting, and the return of fan-favourite pets.

Following a reveal last May, a new trailer for Rune Factory: Project Dragon has now been shared at this year&#x27;s showcase.
It formally introduces the title&#x27;s protagonists Subaru and Kaguya. Instead of farming, the pair will use &quot;the power of dance&quot; to communicate and interact with the world around them. There will be plenty of combat (including new weapons) as well. Here&#x27;s the rundown courtesy of the official PR:

Skald is terrific. I&#x27;ve tried to come up with a clever angle on its journey, but they all wind up saying the same thing: For all its retro stylings (right down to party portraits taking up an unnecessary quarter of the screen at all times), it&#x27;s an accessible, charming treat, and the best modernisation of 80s RPGs that I&#x27;ve ever played.

The recent Content Warning has sucked up all the remaining oxygen in the room, and oxygen is pretty important in Murky Divers, for reasons that are hopefully self-evident. Still, Murky Divers has some fairly eye-catching USPs. It&#x27;s got underwater physics, of course, and it puts you and - unhelpfully - your friends in charge of a submarine.

                              <span>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer Selaco is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage &#x27;em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of F.E.A.R. and Doom, promising both the fiendish AI enemies of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it&#x27;s out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.

                              <span>In Mike Judge’s 1999 cult comedy Office Space, there’s a scene where Ron Livingston’s Peter - a programmer working a tedious corporate job - visits a hypnotist. “Is there any way that you could, sorta, just zonk me out so I don’t know that I’m at work, in here,” Peter asks of the hypnotist, pointing to his head. “Could I come home and think that I’ve been fishing all day, or something?”. That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years. Throw in some Stanley Parable, Control, Gilliam’s Brazil, and some more meta undertones of general musing on gamified reward loops, and you’ve got Severance.

                              <span>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter Office Fight, a stylish physics action game where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.

                              <span>So ends another month of the RPS Game Club, which means another chance to gather together and swap video game opinions like scary stories ‘round the campfire. The topic, comedy rock RPG/door-kicking sim Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, was picked by a sadly absent Alice B, but you know what they say when beloved colleagues become ensnared in the kind of Kafkaesque employment limbo that only a corporate acquisition can engineer: the show must go on. We’re therefore sticking to the schedule, and will launch the liveblog at 4pm BST today, Friday May 31st.

                              <span>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the Valorant community. In a video entitled ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive FPS. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game&#x27;s Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of &#x27;[naughty word SEO doesn&#x27;t like being in the first paragraph] talk&#x27;, you aren&#x27;t welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.

It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don&#x27;t get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.

The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click horror game (Steam page here) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I&#x27;m changing trains...

Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:

                              <span>Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest State Of Play, Concord being a new 5V5 multiplayer FPS in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;vegan&quot; referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I&#x27;ve got an overview trailer for you below.

                              <span>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good action-dad adventure God of War Ragnarök is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the DLSS 3, FSR 3, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.

                              <span>During Sony&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play, new gameplay and details were shared for Marvel Rivals. For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location – the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.
Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man&#x27;s Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.

                              <span>Little Nightmares III, the horror action platformer from Supermassive Games, has moved into 2025. The game never had a specific release date, but we were admittedly expecting it this year. In a post on the official Little Nightmares III X account, the team shared the message below, writing, &quot;As much as we can&#x27;t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we&#x27;ve made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025.&quot;
Please do bear with us, little ones, for we need a little extra time to prepare your visit.

Notably, Supermassive, the developer behind games like Until Dawn (which is coming to PC and PlayStation 5 soon) did not develop the first two games. Those games were developed by Tarsier Studios, whose next project has not been announced.

                              <span>If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. 


The game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is &quot;styling,&quot; which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. 
The more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the &quot;save the world&quot; premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. 
Infinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you&#x27;d expect.
The trailer aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it&#x27;s also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we&#x27;ll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. 
Check it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: 


In a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the &quot;high tension shooter&quot; tasks players with exploring an &quot;overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.&quot; 
&quot;Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it&#x27;ll bring some friends,&quot; the blog post reads. &quot;While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. 
&quot;Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.&quot; 
Alien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season.

                              <span>Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today&#x27;s State of Play presentation. 
Until Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn&#x27;s narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.


Originally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry&#x27;s definition of a remaster. PlayStation&#x27;s official description says it&#x27;s been &quot;rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.&quot; Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. 
We loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn&#x27;s original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.</span>

                              <span>It’s been a long time since we wrote about a new Dynasty Warriors game, but that changes today with the announcement of Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the new release from Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force studio, a team long known for work on the venerable franchise.
The games have an unusual identity and are, in some ways, a genre unto themselves. They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.
That playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.
A lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.
We’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s State of Play concluded with the reveal of a new Astro Bot game. Unlike the last entry, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It&#x27;s also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. 
The trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. 


A PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6. Our review of Astro&#x27;s Playroom can be found here.</span>

                              <span>The remake of Silent Hill 2 has a new trailer and a release date of October 8. Surprisingly, this news comes during Sony’s State of Play instead of the Silent Hill Transmission airing later tonight. 
Regardless, we aren’t complaining about seeing more of Bloober Team’s remake of the PS2 classic. The trailer provides new looks at gameplay and the psychological scares that made the first game so beloved. 


Silent Hill 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive as well as PC.</span>

                              <span>Capcom has pulled back the curtains on Monster Hunter Wilds, revealing gameplay in a brand new trailer that aired during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. In this trailer, we watch a monster hunter ride through a treacherous sandstorm on the back of a mount before starting a fight with a lion-like bear creature, and as you might expect, it looks great. 
We then watch our hunter fight a rocky toad monster in a cavernous canyon area before three buffalo-esque monsters join the fight. If you&#x27;ve played a Monster Hunter before, you have a good idea of what Wilds looks like – big, flashy, and exciting. 
Check it out for yourself in the Monster Hunter Wilds trailer below: 


This is our first look at Monster Hunter Wilds since its reveal at The Game Awards 2023 last December. Those with Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne save date will get exclusive in-game rewards. The trailer also reiterates that Monster Hunter Wild hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025.

The Chinese studio describes its project as “Groundbreaking Oriental Wuxia Open World” on its official website. Today’s trailer seems to bear that out, with a number of bombastic and over-the-top scenes featuring high-flying martial arts against the backdrop of rainswept forests, burning castles, and warriors wielding sword and spear.
Today’s video makes it clear that the game is in development for PlayStation 5, but no word yet on a release date.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced it is bringing its 2022 hit PlayStation-exclusive game, God of War Ragnarök, to PC. It revealed this during today&#x27;s State of Play with a new trailer alongside a September 19 release date. 
This follows PlayStation&#x27;s recent trend of bringing its single-player, narrative-driven games over to PC years after they first launch on PlayStation. Just this month, it brought Ghost of Tsushima Director&#x27;s Cut to PC, and today, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst revealed all live-service games will launch day-and-date on PS5 and PC while &quot;tentpole&quot; single-player games will launch at later dates on PC. 
As you might expect, the PC version of God of War Ragnarök will feature unlocked frame rates, Nvidia DLSS 3.7. (and AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XESS 1.3), super ultrawide support, and other PC features. This version of Ragnarök will feature the free Valhalla DLC from last year, too, and pre-purchasing the game gets you in-game rewards like the Kratos Risen Snow Armor and Atreus Risen Snow Tunic. 
Check it out for yourself below in the God of War Ragnarök PC reveal trailer: 


According to the game&#x27;s Steam listing, it will require a PlayStation Network account. 
God of War Ragnarök hits PC on September 19, 2024.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play revealed a new fantasy action game called Ballad of Antara. The trailer shows all manner of over-the-top stylish combat against supernatural foes. However, the hero does all of this while carrying a small child on his back.


Ballad of Antara is billed as an Unreal Engine 5 single-player, free-to-play action RPG starring multiple characters called Emissaries. Each of these characters sports their own class and abilities, as well as a unique story. Players will travel between two worlds seeking out these Emissaries to strengthen your force, but the young girl being carried around is the apparently the key to salvation. A PlayStation Blog post on the game describes your duty to her as such: &quot;You will help her undo the devastation done to this desolate world through trials, twists, and confrontation, and witness her growth along the way.&quot;
In addition to a single-player story, the game lets up to three players explore together in multiplayer, whether they be close buddies or total strangers wandering the game alongside you. Developer Tipworks also states plans to continually update Ballad of Antara post-launch with new zones, story content, and Emissaries. 
Ballad of Antara is coming to PS5, PC, and mobile platforms in 2025.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has formally revealed Concord, the first game from Firewalk Studios, which it acquired in 2023, and it brings a healthy (and comedic dose) of sci-fi to the console&#x27;s 2024 lineup. Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. 
Before showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game&#x27;s world and tone played, and it&#x27;s here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we&#x27;ll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. 
Check it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: 


After this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord&#x27;s gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2&#x27;s PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. 
Check out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:


After the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game&#x27;s roster revealed several more. 
Firewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you&#x27;ll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. 
Firewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game&#x27;s simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024.

                              <span>V kompresním programu XZ byla před dvěma měsíci objevena šikovně skrytá zadní vrátka CVE-2024–3094. Teoreticky by je bylo možné vzdáleně zneužít přes SSH a knihovnu liblzma, která je součástí XZ. Škodlivé byly verze 5.6 a 5.6.1. Ve středu vyšlo XZ 5.6.2 s již odstraněnými zadními vrátky.</span>

                              <span>Data published by S2CPI, the body responsible for Spain&#x27;s administrative pirate site blocking program, shows that the number of headline domains blocked during Q1 2024 is noticeably down on the same period in 2023 and 2022. Overall, sites are still being blocked in large numbers, but the real growth isn&#x27;t found on main domains. Easily and quickly deployed at almost no cost, subdomains can circumvent blocking and Spain blocks them in their thousands.

                              <span>Revealed during The Game Awards 2023 last December, The First Descendant is an upcoming looter-shooter RPG from Nexon and one of the South Korean company&#x27;s first forays into the console market space. Due out this year, this free-to-play third-person multiplayer shooter is hoping to attract players within the Destiny 2 and Warframe community and newcomers alike. And after playing the game for a couple of hours, we&#x27;re inclined to believe Nexon is on to something here. 
Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Game Informer editor Wesley LeBlanc traveled to Seoul, South Korea, to visit Nexon and speak to some of The First Descendant&#x27;s leads about what players can expect, its plans for the game after launch, and more.

                              <span>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s latest trailer has unveiled fusion warriors for its roster. It also seems to tease another announcement on the horizon.
The trailer reveals the additions of Gotenks (the fusion of Goten and Trunks), Kefla (the fusion of Caulifla and Kale), Fused Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta’s fusions, Vegito and Gogeta. Watch them trade blows in the trailer below: 


Since each fusion includes the fighters that make them up and their various transformations, the full list of characters joining the roster amounts to 21. Check them out below.

The trailer ends with a message serving as a classic callback to the anime that states, “Next time on Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero: Summer Game Fest 2024.” Could we be getting a release date at Geoff Keighley’s showcase? Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.
Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise&#x27;s original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game&#x27;s new mechanics and features here.</span>

Games inspired by The Legend of Zelda are common; after all, the long-running Nintendo franchise is among the most influential series in gaming history. Because of this, various games take the Zelda format and try to replicate it, but these homages often miss out on the magic that makes that series greater than the sum of its parts. This is particularly true in the indie space, with Zelda-inspired titles a dime a dozen, making it difficult to stand out from the crowd. Minishoot&#x27; Adventures clearly draws inspiration from Zelda – specifically A Link to the Past – but by applying…</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not. 
This comes from one of PlayStation&#x27;s dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst, during a public business presentation held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation&#x27;s single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it&#x27;s part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform. 


&quot;Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here,&quot; Hulst said. &quot;On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narra…</span>

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its &quot;Game &amp; Network Services Segment&quot; presentation from PlayStation&#x27;s two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. 
However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it&#x27;s made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. 
As for what Sony is including in its profits, it&#x27;s the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. 
One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony&#x27;s most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. 
Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.

                              <span>Netflix has announced a partnership with Mojang Studios to create a new animated series based on Minecraft. The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.
WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be &quot;showing the world of Minecraft in a new light&quot; and feature an original story with new characters.


This won&#x27;t be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  
The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.</span>

                              <span>Reddit is not required to hand over to filmmakers the IP-addresses of several Redditors who made piracy-related comments. A California federal court denied the filmmakers&#x27; request for a &#x27;de novo&#x27; review, after turning down their initial request in February.

The only EPYC 4004 class processor I wasn&#x27;t able to finish testing in time was the entry-level EPYC 4124P as a 4-core processor with $149 retail price.

The long-rumoured LEGO Zelda set has finally, officially been unveiled and, despite the cost of the adult-focused set causing many a Zelda fan to spit-take their Lon Lon Milk across the room, the 2-in-1 Great Deku Tree looks like a beauty. Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that&#x27;s gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.
Eschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it&#x27;s clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets. Those are great, but for adults it&#x27;s perhaps more exciting to see larger builds and pieces meant equally for display in addition to play.

In one of the least surprising project announcements we&#x27;ve seen in a while, Netflix has today revealed that an animated Minecraft series is in the works.
We know that Mojang Studios will be teaming up with the streaming giant on the series (no surprises there), but that&#x27;s just about all that we know. According to Variety, the show “will feature an original story with new characters, showing the world of ‘Minecraft’ in a new light” and Sonic Prime animation studio WildBrain will be tacking CG duties here too.

If you cast your mind back to the hazy days of 2021, you might remember the reveal of The Garden Path, a super cute-looking sim that flew past its Kickstarter goal and was quickly announced for Switch. Well, after a whopping seven years of development, solo dev cheesecake and publisher Mooncat Games have announced that this bud will be ready to bloom on 30th July.
The Garden Path is all about the little things. This is a game designed to be played in short bursts, where strolling around your garden, meeting new friends and getting lost in distractions are all that you need to worry about.

We&#x27;re always a little bit wary whenever someone says that the latest game in Falcom&#x27;s Trails series is &quot;a great place to start&quot;. We know we&#x27;ve said in the past — as we did with Trails from Zero — but it&#x27;s a statement we always put a lot of consideration into.
This statement holds a lot of weight in this franchise, both among fans, who want everyone to get the same magical experience by playing the series in the &#x27;right order&#x27;, and newcomers, who have the daunting task of playing 10 games — all between 40 and 140 hours of playtime each — across multiple different platforms.

Developer Badass Mongoose has today revealed a first look at Helix: Descent N Ascent — a gorgeous-looking puzzle adventure that will make its way to Switch in 2025.
This is a non-linear adventure that will see you exploring a long-forgotten world, unlocking skills and abilities along the way — including the power to remove and control your own head, it seems. Sounds a little Hollow Knight-y, no? Well, don&#x27;t expect that kind of intensity. It seems that Helix is all about the vibes, with &quot;non-violent gameplay&quot; putting the focus on puzzle-solving and storytelling as you try to work out what happened to the abandoned world.

I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it&#x27;s a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires.

                              <span>Destructive third-person action game Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to the Hollywood Reporter. This isn&#x27;t the first time the over-the-top explode &#x27;em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it&#x27;s been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.

                              <span>The demo for puzzle game Schim, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now on Steam. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.

                              <span>Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month&#x27;s lightning rod for hype. But it&#x27;s worth dissecting what it&#x27;s actually like to play.

                              <span>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down action shooter Kickback. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.

                              <span>An Activision lawsuit targeting a group of Call of Duty cheat makers has ended with a $14.5m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants, all linked to Germany-based EngineOwning UG, initially put up a spirited defense against alleged violations of the DMCA, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and civil RICO, among others. By last summer, all defendants had disengaged from the legal process. At the time of writing, EngineOwning is selling its latest MWIII and Warzone cheat.

Last December, CCTV footage revealed a figure in black spray-painting the words &quot;free movie&quot; time and again. The damage to the culturally significant building was meant to advertise a pirate video site.

                              <span>Many moons ago, premiere wordsman Nate Crowley reviewed shark ‘em up Maneater, decrying its incurious perpetuation of anti-shark propaganda, and calling it “an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool&#x27;s idea of a shark.” My own frothing penchant for the plan-schemes of Warhammer’s Skaven ratboys has been documented in these pages to the point of rabidity, but I do feel broadly similarly about media that sullies rats - clean, smart and good folk that they are. Lively tactics Trash Of The Titans does not aim to emancipate its villainous vermin. But, like Warhammer, it gets a pass for its evident affection towards its antagonistic dumpster diving scuttlers. Also, it&#x27;s just plain fun.

                              <span>A producer on Kerbal Space Program 2 has confirmed that those working on the space flight sim are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a closure announcement from Washington State. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. &quot;We didn&#x27;t shutter those studios,&quot; he told IGN. But it seems clear from one producer&#x27;s testimony that Zelnick&#x27;s remarks are inaccurate.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s next superpowered guest fighter, The Boys’ Homelander, shows off his dominance in a new gameplay trailer. The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.
The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. 


Homelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive.

XDefiant’s core modes offer temporarily fun stabs at the competitive multiplayer arena shooter, but Ubisoft’s latest attempt at carving out a slice of the lucrative esports pie feels half-baked. Core modes like its practice mode and ranked queue are gated off by construction tape at the time of writing. This leaves a bland battle pass with head-scratching progression decisions and standard weapon-based leveling systems as the only tangible means of rewarding you for playing the game or doing well beyond an individual match.

                              <span>Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.
The genre, called &quot;bullet heaven,&quot; puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.
The jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.
You can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.


Hive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.</span>

Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro&#x27;s Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon&#x27;s Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.
At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, Sony shared an interview it performed with Last of Us co-creator and Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann. In it, Druckmann was quoted as saying Naughty Dog&#x27;s next game &quot;could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.&quot; After the interview, Druckmann took to social media to clarify what he said and pointed out that he was misquoted.
In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with SONY, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here&#x27;s the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game... pic.twitter.com/tVuxX3LYJF

In his actual response, Druckmann said little about Naughty Dog&#x27;s next game beyond, &quot;It&#x27;s maybe the most excited I&#x27;ve been for a project yet.&quot; He never made the statement that it could…</span>

Its roster includes studio head and creative director Mike Brown, former creative director of the Forza Horizon series, executive producer Tom Butcher, chief technical officer Matt Craven, and content director Gareth Harwood.

                              <span>Quest Master answers the prayers of a certain segment of the Zelda fanbase by letting them create their own dungeons. With an art direction and gameplay heavily inspired by A Link to the Past, this fun homage is now available in Steam Early Access and gives players the tools to craft dungeons as clever or devious as they desire. Best of all, you can upload creations for other players to enjoy and experience the works of the community. Editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard do just that, exploring Marcus&#x27; custom dungeon to show off some of the game&#x27;s toolset before playing a (far superior) community creation.

Last month, Bandai Namco unveiled a first look at That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime ISEKAI Chronicles, an upcoming RPG based on the popular anime series. The game isn&#x27;t set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.
If you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we&#x27;d wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.

                              <span>Billed as the most advanced anti-piracy system ever, Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield had no chance of living up to the hype. It transpires that just eight weeks after its launch early February, top tier football league Serie A filed a complaint at an Italian court accusing Cloudflare of providing &quot;services to pirates&quot; that undermine Piracy Shield. In parallel, the system is already exceeding blocking limits agreed with ISPs. Now the law needs to be changed, so domains and IPs can be unblocked to free up capacity.

                              <span>I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named &quot;Golden&quot; (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it&#x27;s rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.

                              <span>To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.
Created by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2&#x27;s new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer&#x27;s favourite - on which you&#x27;ll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings.

                              <span>The first scene in RPS Game Club pick Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands - a genuinely funny and innovative riff on turn-based RPGs -  sees candyfloss n’ superglue-haired guitarist Faye frantically search for her missing guitar as the crowd for the titular battle grow impatient. You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.

                              <span>A whopping 1000 corpses have been found in our ongoing investigation into Anthology of the Killer, Rock Paper Shotgun can reveal. The bodies were discovered in the aforementioned murder mystery &quot;video game&quot;, which is out now on itch.io. Following our previous reports we can confirm that exposure to the game&#x27;s crime-infested city can cause severe disorientation, confusion, uncontrolled fits of laughter, and moderate enlightenment. The streets here are so dense with crime that entire apartment blocks must shutter at night. When Rock Paper Shotgun reported the 1000 corpses to detectives, we were told this was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot;.

Sounds like a solid confirmation from me, though Microsoft and Activision have yet to start bellowing the news from any of Call of Duty’s official pulpits.

                              <span>Resident Evils Code Veronica and 0 will be the next entries in the survival horror series to get the remake treatment, according to rumours. “A remake of Resident Evil Zero &amp; Code Veronica in development right now,” claimed user Dusk Golem on Le Epic Musk Zone. The claim was casually corroborated by trustworthy sort Andy Robinson of VGC. Note the wording here, which suggests a bundle package of sorts, similar to the rumoured original plan for the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3.

                              <span>At intervals in our relentless battles with the Maw, we lose people. Sometimes, it&#x27;s because those people have succeeded in levelling up out of games journalism, or found their way into another echelon of the craft. Other times, the losses are more abrupt and arbitrary. In each case, one short term response is intensification. Those of us who remain must be rockier, paperier and more shotgun than ever before. With that in mind, here are this (four-day) week&#x27;s new PC games of note.

It’s only a matter of time before IllFonic perfects the asymmetrical multiplayer experience. Say what you will about its previous games; each one offered entertaining tweaks to the formula, small yet clever innovations, and a seemingly better understanding of what makes this genre so compelling. Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game embodies all these aspects, making it one of IllFonic’s best asymmetric games yet.
Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game offers a familiar gameplay loop for the genre. Seven human players must quick…</span>

                              <span>Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.
First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. 


Lidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector&#x27;s Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter

                              <span>One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft&#x27;s gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.
We don&#x27;t know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, &quot;The truth lies.&quot; The second, released today, can be seen below.


It features world leaders&#x27; black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game&#x27;s full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox&#x27;s summer showcase.

                              <span>Lego has pulled the curtain back on its new playset based on The Legend of Zelda. The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.
The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both games&#x27; versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego&#x27;s website. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Mario.</span>

                              <span>Konami revealed it is holding another Silent Hill Transmission event on May 30 at 4 P.M. PDT. The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.
The post announcing the event reads, &quot;Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we&#x27;ll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.&quot;
The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise&#x27;s next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it&#x27;s possible we may learn what&#x27;s next for that game.</span>

If you haven’t seen the trailer for Kingmakers, I encourage you to watch it now before continuing. If you have, or perhaps you are reading this magazine in an effort to limit screen time (you’re doing great, and we appreciate your support), I can’t continue to talk about the game without spoiling its major twist. The trailer teases what appears to be a medieval strategy game with base-building elements before a contemporary, but admittedly junky truck screams through time to arrive in the middle of a battlefield brimming with horses, suits of armor, and presumably the shouting of old English phrases, but it’s difficult to hear through the chaos.

                              <span>In 2009, a video game called Canabalt was published on the iOS App Store. It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.
Now working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit. Whether you’re playing the bass guitar as Mae Borowski in Night In The Woods, organizing patchwork-colored boxes in Wilmo…</span>

But shirts like this used to be made by humans. While making coffee, I ask Siri on my iPhone what the weather will be like today and what my day’s schedule looks like, and a few seconds later, an artificial intelligence-powered voice gives me the answers I’m looking for. After sitting down at my work computer to write this, I opened Spotify and checked out my Discover Weekly playlist, hyper-curated to my tastes based on the other music I’ve listened to over the past week.
On Instagram, my ads feel uncannily targeted to me, and on X (formerly Twitter), I see a new batch of posters for Amazon’s upcoming Fallout streaming series called out for using A.I. N…</span>

                              <span>The final character of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Year 1 DLC plans, Akuma, finally hit the game earlier this week. I had the chance to catch up with director Takayuki Nakayama about the importance of the Great Demon. However, in February, I sat down with Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to discuss the addition of Ed to Street Fighter 6. During that conversation, Nakayama shared an intriguing anecdote about how important Ed was to the development of Street Fighter 6.
When the team sits down to decide on the characters, they think of balancing out the roster not only in style, but through the regions and countries the characters represent. However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6&#x27;s case, World Tour – also plays a big role.

He shared the recipe for a Cuban dish – the Arroz con Pollo – in an in-game radio station in Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, and it’s one that he describes as “very controversial.” The trick, according to Douglas, a senior writer at Night School Studio, is to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the dish instead of bone-in, skin-on thighs and drumsticks.
“My family’s from Cuba,” says Douglas. “It was my mom’s recipe that I have transformed into my recipe. And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way. I’m genuinely afraid of telling her this.”

The 2018 release of Frostpunk delivered a unique twist on the city-builder genre, putting you in control of a band of humans trying to survive the new ice age. Players assumed the role of The Captain as they built up their small colony of workers to a flourishing city in the post-apocalypse. Along the way, players needed to make hard decisions, like restricting food, enforcing strict authoritarian laws, putting children to work, or worse. Frostpunk 2 picks up the story 30 years later and, in the process, looks to impr…</span>

Expendables movies come with a three-point guarantee: lots of explosions, a solid 6/10 aggregate score on the Internet Movie Database, and thousands of people being monitored on BitTorrent so they can be sued at a later date. Almost 3,000 now face action in Canada&#x27;s Federal Court.

While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn&#x27;t [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).

                              <span>A Seattle jury has issued a landmark verdict following the legal battle between &#x27;Destiny 2&#x27; creator Bungie and cheat seller AimJunkies. The &#x27;cheat&#x27; company and its three owners are liable for copyright infringement and must pay damages to Bungie. The same applies to an independent cheat developer whose counterclaim, alleging that Bungie &#x27;hacked&#x27; his computer, was denied.

                              <span>The seemingly endless possibilities of generative AI are not on an unavoidable collision course with copyright law; the collision happened way back and sooner or later, someone will have to pick up the bill. In the meantime, popular LLMs seem to be developing a stubborn, pro-copyright streak, partly due to all the industry propaganda they&#x27;ve been consuming. But don&#x27;t fight back, it&#x27;s time to team up.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is out this week, but the starting line for developer Ninja Theory&#x27;s foray into the world of action games with a focus on performance capture began with Heavenly Sword. Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as you&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.

Interestingly, a download option is now available for UFC fans who legally subscribe to UFC Fight Pass. The feature is available in the software &quot;UFC Ripper&quot; and its developer hopes that Dana White will allow the tool to exist.

                              <span>Operation Creative is a multi-agency anti-piracy initiative led by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, also known as PIPCU. The primary aim is to shut down pirate sites but if that proves elusive, depriving sites of advertising revenue by placing them on a blacklist is seen as the next best thing. The Infringing Website List (IWL) isn&#x27;t made public but since there was no celebration of its recent 10-year anniversary, here&#x27;s what the decade-old list has been getting up to lately.

The Taskmasters themselves, Greg Davies and Alex Horne, will be represented in-game, and Horne, who created the concept of the show and is technically its sole writer (see below) was available to chat about it. We learned about the upcoming VR game (releasing June 13 on Quest), why the American Comedy Central version of the show didn&#x27;t work, whether or not it is time to give an American version another shot, and what it is like to meet yourself in VR. So without further ado... it&#x27;s little Alex Horne!

Perhaps best known for roles like The Watcher in Marvel&#x27;s What If...?, Commissioner Gordon in The Batman, and Bernard in HBO&#x27;s Westworld series, as well as his role as Thelonious &quot;Monk&quot; Ellison in 2023&#x27;s American Fiction, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, Wright will return to Naughty Dog&#x27;s post-apocalyptic world to give Isaac another go. 
HBO announced this today with a quick post on X (formerly Twitter) that you can see below:

                              <span>A new season of Fortnite is now live, and it brings Fallout, Magneto, plenty of nitrous oxide, and some Mad Max-esque flair to the battle royale. Titled &quot;Wrecked,&quot; Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 3 follows last season&#x27;s Greek Gods-themed season with a new battle pass, new weapons and skins, and more. 
&quot;A ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland,&quot; an Epic Games blog post reads. &quot;The &#x27;Wasteland Warriors&#x27; have already called shotgun on owning the place (they did ride in with the sandstorm, after all). This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they&#x27;ve already established.&quot; 
We&#x27;ll break down those new locations and more below.

Every so often, I see a premise for a game that really grabs me. The Alters is the latest with its unique take on the &quot;what if&quot; questions and multiverses. What starts as seemingly a standard survival game set on a hostile alien planet quickly introduces enticing base-building mechanics and a fun premise of escaping an ever-encroaching deadly sunrise. But it&#x27;s the unique idea of the main character not only learning how different his life would have been had he made different choices at pivotal moments in his past but also being able to meet and work alongside those versions of hi…</span>

                              <span>The Sims 4 is fast approaching its 10th birthday this September, a fact that genuinely instilled me with the crushing sense of time marching relentlessly on when I checked its release date a moment ago. That near-decade has brought a whole heap of additions, expansions, packs and updates to the enduring life sim game, to the degree that the underlying tech serving as the foundation for dozens of later mechanical and visual elements can sometimes look a bit wobbly these days.

The captivating, combat-free Metroidvania is rich with a delectable buffet of challenges, puzzles and secrets to find even once you’ve seen the credits roll. Still, players have chewed their way through its more-ish platforming and puzzle-solving much faster than its solo developer intended, it turns out. Luckily for us all, creator Billy Basso is already looking ahead to a new game set in the moody zoo-niverse - even if that’s not a complete sequel.

We&#x27;re not going to talk about any of that hoity-toity quantum wheeling-and-dealing in this piece, however. We&#x27;re going to talk about the fact that the opening stretch reminded me of Gears Of War and the many over-the-shoulder adventures it has influenced. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s been a complicated week involving minimal sleep, and I no longer have the grey cells for branching timelines, though they are certainly the more fascinating aspect of this game.

                              <span>In one of the better gaming trends of the last few years, we appear to have entered a golden age for booting the crud out of doors. There’s Deathbulge of course, but also the upcoming Anger Foot, Abiotic Factor, and a load more I’m sure. There was also literally Door Kickers, but that was ages ago. Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.

                              <span>I cannot compare my experience of writing a review for The Splintered Sea, the first paid expansion for dastardly clever physics puzzle builder Besiege, to that of a journaling sailor facing lethal storms on the horizon. Still, if we take for granted the idea that a review is only really valuable as an insight into the experience of the player: I haven’t been feeling especially great this week. That in mind: Splintered Sea is more Besiege, thoughtfully applied to its already expansive toolkit. More importantly, it&#x27;s currently bringing me deep and deeply needed moments of untainted, childlike, vaguely-Orkish joy.

Said Call Of Duty game is Black Ops 6, &quot;a dark new chapter&quot; in the Treyarch-helmed FPS sub-series which is known for seedier and weirder, alt-historical or post-future stories featuring hallucinations and cybernetics and catchy period music.

                              <span>The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year’s ROG Ally handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at Videocardz. I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under &quot;News James wants to be true.&quot;

Warhammer is big, so it needs must have multiple of them, hence their yearly event Skulls, which collates a bunch of Games Workshop related announcements into a sort of bizzaro world Nintendo Direct if Yoshi was actually a parasitic corpse emperor. There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based strategy Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.

                              <span>Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur&#x27;s Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).
BioWare&#x27;s first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it&#x27;s not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

The High Court of New Delhi issued a dynamic+ blocking order targeting several pirate sites, mostly streaming portals. The order also requires domain registrars to suspend the associated domains and Namecheap appears to have already taken swift action in response.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector&#x27;s Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector&#x27;s box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector&#x27;s Edition will set you back $200.
Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you&#x27;re not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you&#x27;re in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.

                              <span>Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone&#x27;s mind is likely Xbox&#x27;s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.
Atari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. 
&quot;This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,&quot; chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. 
&quot;Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,&quot; CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. &quot;We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.&quot;
Atari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari&#x27;s outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.</span>

                              <span>When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a &quot;beloved&quot; series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it&#x27;s a new Call of Duty game.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn&#x27;t a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game&#x27;s campaign.


The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, &quot;The truth lies,&quot; while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.
The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.

                              <span>Jason, alongside Agent Smith from The Matrix, had a cameo in the last MultiVersus trailer, but now he is the star. The footage shows off his moveset, like hitting opponents with a machete, collapsing them in a camp bunk bed, and hitting them with a sleeping bag stuffed with the body of another player. You also get a look at at least one of his alternate costumes.


MultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

                              <span>While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it&#x27;s often perceived, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.
Sure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.

This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate &quot;the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers&quot;. The horror comedy already won its creators the Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific game maker Stephen &quot;thecatamites&quot; Gillmurphy. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its full release on Itch.io on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they&#x27;re cool. There&#x27;s a trailer below.

While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and Proton GE will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.
As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious Steam Deck Academy readers.

                              <span>Most people agree that cheating is an unfair way to win at online video games, but do cheating tools actually break the law? This question is at the center of a landmark trial currently underway between cheat maker AimJunkies and Destiny 2 creator Bungie.  Among other things, the jury must decide whether the cheat maker infringed the game&#x27;s copyrights.

                              <span>The Market Court in Finland has just thrown out an attempt by a law firm to obtain the personal details of suspected BitTorrent users, without actually being a rightsholder of the works in question. After years spent representing movie rightsholders, the law firm felt copyright law should be interpreted as granting it rightsholder-like powers to obtain names, addresses, and similar information, without the rightsholders themselves having to be part of the action.

With the decision to pull the game from sale and turn off its servers for months on end after allowing people to sink their real-life money into unlocking costumes and such (with no refunds), its developers are now looking to seemingly give something back in return.

Which clearly makes it the perfect fit for a bit of upcoming DLC for military-fetishising interactive gun range Call of Duty.

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we&#x27;re all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we&#x27;re ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it&#x27;s the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.
And what we&#x27;ve found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven&#x27;t explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can&#x27;t make sense of it and we don&#x27;t think we ever will.

                              <span>Hauntii sets the scene with a rather magical opening sequence. A beam of light shoots out of a mysterious planet and a zoom in reveals the beam to be an asteroid, but not just any asteroid: a crystal shaped like a teardrop, with a little ghost nestled inside. You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you&#x27;re dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.

                              <span>At RPS we like Alices. When somebody comes along with the name &quot;Alice&quot; you don&#x27;t just say &quot;oh hi&quot; like some insolent rube. You nod with solemn respect and you say, &quot;Alice&quot;. An Alice is someone you should not take lightly, nor take for granted, nor leave unmonitored. For they will destroy worlds and build better ones while you are not looking. This is dangerous and exciting. Alices are a force to be reckoned with. To treat an Alice poorly is to invite shame, dishonour, and contempt. Here are some of the best Alices in video games!

                              <span>We just got a new Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You&#x27;re likely confused, and that&#x27;s understandable. As the foremost authority on ephemeral nonsense in Elden Ring, I’m the only one who has your back here.

                              <span>Internet provider Cox Communication has fought several piracy-related claims in court over the past decade. In one of the lawsuits, against music rights group BMG, it chose to settle, presumably for millions of dollars. The company hoped that its insurers would help cover the costs, but after the companies declined, Cox is now back in court after suing them both.

                              <span>I could pretend I understand Square Enix&#x27;s action-RPG series Kingdom Hearts, but I don&#x27;t need to, &#x27;cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don&#x27;t properly understand it), wasn&#x27;t on PC. After some games arrived on the Epic Games Store in 2021, Squeenix have confirmed that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn&#x27;t watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.

                              <span>Risk Of Rain 2 is one of my fave action roguelikes, as it&#x27;s a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That&#x27;s why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there&#x27;s a new map, too.

                              <span>The neighbourhood citizens of Life By You are positioning themselves as bright-eyed pretenders to The Sims. But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. &quot;[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead,&quot; said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, &quot;rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.&quot;

                              <span>To borrow a tired Xitterism: The Venn diagram between ‘games that have reference points outside of other games’ and ‘games I’m likely to get excited about’ is a circle. For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.

                              <span>The next part of Undertale creator Toby Fox’s current project Deltarune is actually two parts, as chapters 3 and 4 plan to release together. It sounds like that release is still a ways off, according to a recent update from Fox, even as the latest chapter seemingly makes “great progress” and the team eye up work on Chapter 5.

                              <span>Flashy action-RPG Stellar Blade looks like it could be the next PlayStation 5 exclusive to find its way over to PC, as developers Shift Up say they’re pondering a PC release. They’re also thinking about a sequel - probably not much of a surprise given the first game has sold well on just the one platform, by all accounts - while working on a new game that should also be headed to PC, codenamed Project Witches.

Its strategy fundamentals were already strong enough to impress me in 2022 that it&#x27;s been quite tricky to even remember what&#x27;s changed. But there&#x27;s more of it, and although after much reflection I think it&#x27;s not quite, quite for me, more of a good and unusual thing is definitely enough to push me into a very nearly wholehearted endorsement.

                              <span>Wacky space station management sim Startopia and wacky hosptial sim Theme Hospital are two of my favourite older games, so I was very pleased with the concept of Galacticare, which is a wacky space station hospital management sim. And you know what? It&#x27;s great! From early reveals and previews I thought it might veer into being too wacky, but it nails its tone, has some really striking levels, and bugs in earlier builds have been squashed (much as you can manually splat small parasites that make their way into your hospital). I can see this becoming a go-to comfort game for me.

                              <span>I may have winced a bit, initially, at Alice Bee’s choice of RPS Game Club game for this month. Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase &quot;by Ernest Cline&quot; does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.

                              <span>There are management games and there are micro-management games. Prison Architect 2 is the latter. I don&#x27;t mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn&#x27;t finished yet, but it&#x27;s taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It&#x27;s dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy&#x27;s closing chapter. It&#x27;s a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and Divinity Original Sin developers Larian today announced the opening of a new studio in Warsaw, Poland.

Though the sheer amount of polish and Stuff in even its pre-release form might have you thinking that a full 1.0 release can’t be too far down the line, the game’s creative director reckons we’ve still got around a year to wait before it’s considered all finished up.

                              <span>I love building games, but it&#x27;s not that often that put one down and feel particularly tempted to get straight back into it again. Of Life And Land is one of those, but thankfully not so much so that it threatens to consume my every waking moment.
It quietly does several things in a modest little way, that are all the more impressive for its lack of fanfare. The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead.

The same requirement, you might recall, that Helldivers 2 players recently lobbied Sony into abandoning. No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.

                              <span>Our players have played a lot of OpenTTD 14 since it was released a few weeks ago – in last week alone those who opted into our survey played 34,700 hours across 17,219 games. In all those hours, you’ve found some bugs, and we’ve done our best to fix them. The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multiplayer desync bug and cleans up a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
