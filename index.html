                              <span>Resident Evil 4 centers on Leon’s mission to rescue Ashley Graham, daughter of the U.S. president. She’s been kidnapped by a mysterious cult and held captive in a rural Spanish village players must search and survive in. Once you find Ashley, you become both her protector and, sometimes, partner. Her mechanics and interactions with Leon have some big changes, so as part of our larger cover story, I asked directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi to explain their reasons for making them. 
By clicking the right analog stick, Leon can tell Ashley to keep close (yelling &quot;come on!&quot;) or to maintain some distance (&quot;spread out&quot;). You can no longer command her to stop; she follows no matter what. That means no more ditching her in a safe spot to clear out enemies lying ahead like in the original R…</span>

WWE 2K22 relaunched the franchise on the right foot, and 2K23 aims to build upon that success. The improvements and additions from last year’s game remain intact and expanded in some cases. The legendary John Cena gives his blessing of sorts by gracing the game&#x27;s cover and starring in the centerpiece Showcase mode. That’s all well and good, but the addition of the long-requested WarGames match may be 2K23’s most exciting bullet point.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly canceled a single-player game set in the shared Apex Legends and Titanfall universe. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the matter say EA canceled the project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, that was in development at Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment. Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. 


The publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. 
It&#x27;s likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.&quot;
Word of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter&#x27;s developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn&#x27;s upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. 
The company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It&#x27;s important to note this isn&#x27;t a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it&#x27;s likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. 
PlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console&#x27;s big holiday release. 


Including both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. 
PlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2&#x27;s 45.4 million but down from Q1&#x27;s 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5&#x27;s lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.
In terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That&#x27;s up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. 
All told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5&#x27;s best quarter yet.

                              <span>Spoilers inside!
If you&#x27;ve played through Bayonetta 3, odds are you noticed the soundtrack while blasting away demons and angels alike: and that includes the song &quot;We Are As One.&quot;
Performed by Rachael Hawnt (who also worked on the lyrics, with music by Hiroshi Yamaguchi), the video is a whopping seven minutes long: mixing in real-life footage of Hawnt and musicians performing the song, on top of cutscenes from Bayonetta 3. Note that the video (as Nintendo warns) does contain spoilers for the game. We won&#x27;t mention them specifically here, but it does flash through scenes from mid-to-late game Bayonetta 3 story moments amid the footage of the performance. Folks who have finished the game already will likely get more out of it, especially given the emotional resonance of the song itself.
This is all great timing, as the powers that be are planning a full OST release for Bayonetta 3 this April, with a whopping 250 tracks across eight CDs. Here&#x27;s the full breakdown of what the mega-release contains: &quot;It is the largest in the series, containing more than 250 tracks on 8 CDs. Liner notes are included, including explanations of all tracks and comments from the creators and directors. Beautifully packaged in a three-sided decorative box. Fully supervised by the game developer, Platinum Games.&quot;

It’s hard to believe that Backbone was a year and a half ago. My memories of it are suitably hazy outside some key scenes, but I remember the visual appeal, its interesting setting, and the fact that its narrative came so damned close to being satisfying and just falls slightly short. The important thing is I wanted more, so I was excited when Eggnut announced their next game would continue the series.
Tails: The Backbone Preludes is exactly that: a set of four short stories that flesh out Backbone’s characters. While it gives more context to what goes on in the narrative of Backbone, what I feel is more important about it is it’s another excuse to descend into the discomforting, roiling pot of pitch-noir narrative that the series is going for.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has officially revealed the new titles that it will be offering up for all of its PlayStation Plus subscribers for February 2023 — And it&#x27;s a blam-blam-heavy quartet for this month, with offerings Evil Dead: The Game, Destiny 2: Beyond Light, Mafia: Definitive Edition and, perhaps the most violent title of the four, OlliOlli World.

Released in May of last year, Evil Dead: The Game is an atmospheric asymmetrical multiplayer title, meticulously crafted by Saber Interactive. A tribute to the legacy of the notorious horror series, Evil Dead: The Game brings together heroes and villains gathered from Sam Raimi&#x27;s iconic movie trilogy, the goofy TV series Ash vs. The Evil Dead, and Fed…</span>

Sony Interactive Entertainment has confirmed that it will be closing down its &quot;PS Plus Collection&quot; this spring — The collection represents a selection of 19 best-selling PS4 titles, readily available to all PS5 PlayStation Plus subscribers. Access to the library will end on May 9.
The PS Plus Collection is a who&#x27;s who of PS4 hits, and includes titles such as God of War, Batman: Arkham Knight, Bloodborne, Resident Evil 7, The Last of Us Remastered, Until Dawn, Fallout 4, Days Gone, and Monster Hunter: World, among many others. Given the pedigree of the titles on offer,the collection is certainly one of the most inviting aspects of the PlayStation Plus subscription.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iEsLzh0xLZc&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;PlayStation
SIE confirmed that all registered titles will still be readily available to players after the collection is removed, so be sure to jump in and &quot;log&quot; all the games from the PS Plus Collection before the fated date — That way they&#x27;ll always be available to redownload from the PlayStation Store, because you don&#x27;t have enough of a backlog already, of course. All titles will also remain available for purchase.
PlayStation Plus launched its revamped, tier-based subscription service in the summer of 2022. This variant of the classic service, structured to compete with the Xbox Game Pass service, offers PlayStation users access to a variety of brand-new, recent, and classic PlayStation games on a monthly basis, with rotating titles, beta access, and other bonuses.
The PS Plus Collection will be removed from the PlayStation Store on May 9.

Amid several other shifts in Electronic Arts&#x27; schedule, the publisher is apparently also calling off an unannounced single-player venture into the shared Apex and Titanfall universe.
According to a new report from Bloomberg, EA has canceled a single-player game based on Apex Legends and Titanfall, which share the same universe. The game was code-named Titanfall Legends and was directed by designer Mohammad Alavi until he left EA early last year.
EA will reportedly try to find positions for the team of about 50 employees within the company. Anyone who can&#x27;t be placed will receive severance and be laid off.
The project had not been publicly announced, though Respawn has been toying with the idea of returning to Titanfall for some time. The last entry was 2016&#x27;s T…</span>

Have you ever been listening to music, enjoying yourself, and then BAM, suddenly you hear the first four notes of a song from a video game — and then you have that song stuck in your head for the rest of the day?
Well, that&#x27;s not always a coincidence. Many musical composers take heavy inspiration from their favourite music, sometimes on purpose, sometimes without even realising it. It&#x27;s called interpolation, and it&#x27;s a common musical technique in which a musician uses borrowed melodies to craft their own song. It&#x27;s functionally different from sampling, which is taking a direct sample from another song, and more importantly, it&#x27;s not stealing!

It&#x27;s a week of mixed fortunes for the Switch in this week&#x27;s Famitsu charts (via Gematsu). The big story is that the PlayStation 5 has outsold all Switch models to be the best-selling hardware of the week of 23rd - 29th January. Sony&#x27;s console sold an impressive 53,256 units this week, edging past the combined sales of the Switch OLED, the normal Switch, and the Lite (51,108).
More on those console sales in a bit, however. In terms of the software charts, the Switch has dominated as usual, and we have another new number one this week. Marvelous&#x27; Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life, a remake of GameCube favourite Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, tops the physical charts, selling 40,759 units, knocking Fire Emblem Engage off the top.

In a recent interview with Game Informer, Evil Empire - the development studio responsible for Dead Cells&#x27; post-launch content - talked extensively about the upcoming &#x27;Return to Castlevania&#x27; expansion.
According to Evil Empire&#x27;s co-founder, Benjamin Laulan, the DLC will be the studio&#x27;s most embitious expansion so far and will be &quot;twice as big&quot; as all of the expansions released previously:

                              <span>Well, that&#x27;s something at least!
As you will all likely know by now (we hope), the 3DS and Wii U eShops will no longer allow users to purchase or download new games onto their systems come March 27th, 2023.
Nintendo has been reasonably forthright regarding what will and won&#x27;t be possible after this date, but one question that&#x27;s been lingering in our minds in recent months is whether or not users will be able to perform a complete system transfer between two 3DS consoles, including downloaded software and eShop accounts. System transfers require an internet connection and authentication via Nintendo&#x27;s servers, and not being able to transfer to another console would cause problems if, for example, the case got damaged somehow, or perhaps you wanted to upgrade to a New 2/3DS in the future.

2nd February 2023 marks the 25th anniversary of Contra&#x27;s North American debut on the NES, nearly a year after it rocket-launched into Japanese arcades in 1987. To celebrate, we&#x27;re republishing this ranked list of all the Contra games that came to Nintendo platforms in one form or another. Enjoy!

Contra is one of a handful of franchises that have become completely synonymous with gaming; indeed, chances are if you haven&#x27;t played any Contra games, then you&#x27;ll have at least heard of them. Konami&#x27;s run-and-shoot-&#x27;em-up behemoth may have lost a lot of its lustre in recent years (pretty much par for the course with Konami these days, it seems, save for some excellent retro collections), but its earlier iterations have become iconic in their own right.

                              <span>It&#x27;s dangerous to go alone, take this (with a pinch of salt).
Ever since Nintendo collaborated with LEGO on the interactive Super Mario collection, we have all been keeping our fingers crossed for an expansion into other franchises in the future. Chief amongst these is the hope for some Zelda sets which, in the build up to Tears of the Kingdom, have kept the rumour mill churning over the past few months in particular.
Just last month we heard of a Breath of the Wild set that had qualified for official review (presumably slipping in before LEGO blocked any further Zelda-themed submissions) and now we have seen yet another design that is doing the rounds on LEGO forums (thanks, Nintendo Everything). Before we dive into the details, it is worth bearing in mind that this is still heavy rumour talk. No official announcement has come from LEGO and there is no way to validate the story or images for the moment.

We are a little under two weeks away from Valentine&#x27;s Day 2023, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped The Pokémon Company from getting itself in order and letting us all know what&#x27;s in store for the day of love this year over on Pokémon GO.
Beginning on 8th February, the in-game &#x27;Valentine&#x27;s Day Event&#x27; will continue throughout the week on the run up to the big day (14th Feb, in case you were wondering). This year, the celebrations will circulate around the debut of Mega Gardevoir as well as shiny variants of Frillish and Tapu Lele. This, of course, comes alongside the usual announcements of Research Quests and Event Rewards.

Nintendo of America has released a music video for Bayonetta 3&#x27;s main theme, &#x27;We Are As One&#x27;, on its YouTube channel.
Performed by the incredibly talented Rachael Hawnt (who also won Series One of the British talent series &#x27;Starstruck&#x27;, for those of you who watch the telebox), the video cuts between clips of the recording process for the song and snippets of the game itself. Nintendo has also generously included the track&#x27;s lyrics, just in case you fancy crooning to your loved ones over a candlelit dinner.

Announced by the official Mario Kart Tour Twitter account, we don&#x27;t know much about the new course yet, except that it&#x27;s an underwater course filled with ruins and statues of Piranha Plants. You can see two Petey Piranha stone heads near the back. Also, everyone remembers the eel from Super Mario 64, right? He&#x27;s there too! Great! All of our nightmares back to haunt us...

While we wait for the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, we&#x27;ve got some interesting news to share about the game&#x27;s developer Team Cherry. It seems the Australian-based team has recently filed a trademark down under for the words &quot;Fearless Fox&quot;.
According to the Australian Government&#x27;s IP Australia website, last month Team Cherry requested its trademark for &quot;Fearless Fox&quot; be expanded to &#x27;Class 28, 41 and 42&#x27; to cover a range of products beyond video games such as toys. This trademark was originally filed in 2019 under &#x27;Class 9&#x27; - &quot;computer game software&quot; (thanks, NME).

It&#x27;s not every day you see someone applying video game skills to real life, but last year this actually happened when NASCAR racer Ross Chastain recreated a move from the GameCube title NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup to secure the final qualifying spot for the championship.
While it was quite an impressive feat at the time, NASCAR has now released its new rules modifications for the 2023 season - stating how this &quot;thrilling&quot; stunt came with &quot;an increased safety risk&quot; - as well as compromising the safety of competitors, officials and spectators.

Back in July last year, it was discovered EA and Respawn Entertainment were working on a brand new single-player adventure set in the Apex Legends Universe.
In a new development, Electronic Arts has reportedly cancelled the project, codenamed Titanfall Legends. &quot;Three people familiar with the matter&quot; have apparently confirmed this with Bloomberg. The same article explains how EA gave a &quot;disappointing outlook&quot; for revenue in the current quarter, and as a result, would also be cancelling Apex Legends for mobile.

We ran out of themes, so we&#x27;re going to flip to a magazine-ish show, where we discuss some current events as well as the games we&#x27;ve been playing. This week we talk about games on film, with everyone bloody loving The Last Of Us TV show and reports that Lara Croft will be hitting the small screen too. We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real. Plus: &quot;try cutting off their limbs&quot;; what is Forspoken, and why so graphics?

These days we only occasionally get offered free stuff as part of our jobs, because we are not YouTubers or Twitch streamers. When I first started websites would get sent a lot of stuff -  you know, statuettes and toys and doodads. I don&#x27;t like these things, and I always wished PRs sent me cake instead. Neither thing would make me like the game more, but at least I can eat cake, and the same cannot be said for a figurine of some kind of big-titted space samurai holding a sword.
I have, however, discovered that plushies of game characters I like are an exception to this.

                              <span>With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN&#x27;s Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn&#x27;t all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon&#x27;s Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn&#x27;t actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. 

This time, though, you&#x27;re right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home?

                              <span>If you spent a portion of the 90s going cross-eyed to look at Magic Eye 3D pictures of dolphins, elephants, and sailboats emerging from fields of noise, you might enjoy the new platformer from indie developer Daniel Linssen. It&#x27;s called Stereogram, because it&#x27;s made of moving stereograms. Let your eyes go slack and gaze into the distance of an optical illusion as you jump around pretty little Magic Eye levels in this platformer which reminds me of VVVVVV.

                              <span>Delete After Reading is a delightful looking text-based puzzler that will be familiar to anyone who’s played Simogo’s excellent (albeit sadly iOS-only game) Device 6, only with fewer spooks this time. Like Simogo&#x27;s surreal thriller, most of Delete After Reading plays out like you&#x27;re reading a novel, where scrolling through paragraphs of text will reveal images, clues and puzzles you can interact with. As the devs put it, Delete After Reading is a “game you can read, and a book you can play,” and looks and sounds really quite rad. Even better, it’s releasing on March 14th.

                              <span>Okay, we all agree that the ocean is kind screwed up right? Like, we’ve all seen that YouTube video showing how deep the sea is and unanimously agree that it’s, like, terrifying? As much as I love relaxing subaquatic city builders and exploring underwater alien worlds, I want games about stuff in the sea that makes my skin crawl to think about. Enter Full Fathom.
So, Full Fathom isn’t out yet, or even has an official release date, but I just love the idea and look of this game. Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.

                              <span>Last night was a restless one for the Steam Deck. In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. 
Ubi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks.

                              <span>Fans have been clamouring for a sequel to Titanfall 2 since its release in 2016, but it looks like we might need to put those hopes on hold for a little longer. According to a report from Bloomberg, EA have cancelled an unannounced project codenamed Titanfall Legends, a single-player mash-up between Titanfall and Apex Legends - Respawn’s battle royale, set in the same universe. Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week. EA are reportedly trying to find other positions for the devs, but those that aren&#x27;t rehired are being laid off with severance.

                              <span>Sometimes I want to describe games in the most high-brow way possible. I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.
Hi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. 
Hi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum.

                              <span>In August 2022, Epic Games—developers of Fortnite, custodians of the Epic Games Store, creators of the Unreal Engine, rich as God—published a melee-based battle royale game called Rumbleverse. It is now January 2023 (February already for me here in Australia), and the game is already being killed off.

We all have that friend who would just destroy us in a one-on-one battle in Marvel Snap. Or maybe you are that friend! Either way, until now, players have been mostly playing against themselves. The goal has been to win matches to upgrade cards, which earns Collection Level points. Collection Level points lead to gaining more cards. After the most recent update, however, you can challenge your friends to a duel. Here&#x27;s how you can utilize Battle Mode in Marvel Snap to compete against your friends.
Update that app
The new update can be found in your app store if you&#x27;re using the mobile version of Marvel Snap. It&#x27;s not necessarily an automatic update for many players, so go to the app page in whichever app store you used to download it. There will be a …</span>

Epic Games has unveiled their full plans for the return of the Dragon Ball Z franchise in Fortnite, and the fairly big content patch is live now.
On top of the return of the Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud items (as well as the capsules that deliver them), we&#x27;re also getting Gohan and Piccolo. Here&#x27;s a full breakdown, as well as a brief overview of a very welcome weekly quest change.
Here is all the 2023 Dragon Ball stuff that was added to Fortnite
Both Gohan and Piccolo were added in as premium outfits (characters), which you can buy with V-Bucks.
Gohan Outfit
Gohan&#x27;s Cape Back Bling - A gift from Piccolo to inspire him to return to training. (Included with the Son Gohan Outfit. Can only be used with this Outfit.)
Gohan&#x27;s Beast Axe Pickaxe - Go beyond ultimate!

Trading Posts are now live in World of Warcraft, and it might be confusing in terms of discerning what they actually do, and where to find them. Since they&#x27;re found in separate capital cities, each faction will have to access their own Trading Posts. Here&#x27;s where to locate them!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;fOhJEqTBPPY
What are Trading Posts?
Think of Trading Posts as an extra in-game season pass of sorts, opening a new path to more cosmetic items. After logging in on a monthly basis, you&#x27;ll get 500 currency for the Trading Post.
Here&#x27;s the full description from Blizzard:
&quot;A new feature is making its way to World of Warcraft on February 1 — the Trading Post! Complete monthly activities to earn currency toward decking out your characters in cosmetic transmogs, pets, and mounts— with new items and activities introduced every month.&quot;

                              <span>Cross your fingers and catch them all!
In the early days of the anime, Ditto was a little awkward with its shape-shifting. It could perfectly pull off every other detail except the face! It was almost horrific when the Pokémon would turn around and have this blank face, but at least it was easy to tell that it was Ditto. In the games, this little quirk is not present. If you&#x27;re searching for a Ditto in Pokémon GO, unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to distinguish one in disguise from just a normal Pokémon. So how in the world do you catch one?
Honestly, you just have to get lucky! That&#x27;s a sucky answer, I know. Unfortunately, you won&#x27;t know if a Pokémon is a Ditto in disguise until you catch it. Only once it is safely captured in the PokéBall will a little question pop up. Then Ditto&#x27;s true form will be revealed. Of all of the Pokémon to catch, that has to be the most exciting then!
These tricky little blobs are pretty rare, and their shiny counterparts are even rarer. Don&#x27;t worry though, a shiny Ditto will not be disguised as a shiny Pokémon. You don&#x27;t have to be afraid that when you finally catch a shiny you&#x27;ve been looking forward to it will turn out to be a blue blob of putty.
Niantic, the team behind Pokémon GO, doe not release an official list of Pokémon each month that are likely to be the shape-shifter. The whole idea is to have the illusion that it could be any of them. However, some sites, such as IGN, have a running list of likely disguises each month based on anecdotal evidence. People catch Ditto and seem to find monthly patterns, which makes sense from a tech standpoint.
You can&#x27;t really train Ditto, and it&#x27;s useless in battles, so you might as well just enjoy the lottery. Maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky, maybe you won&#x27;t. If you want more concrete tips on catching Pokémon in the mobile game, we have guides on how to catch Leafeon and Glaceon as well as how to catch Kecleon.

Something of a hidden gem has finally received an English localization, albeit from fans. Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero (hereby known as Shockman Zero) is an entry in the Shockman series of games. While the series is better known for its entries on the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16, it got its sole Super Famicom release in 1997 via the Satellaview. Over here in the west, we only received Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2 in 1992 as Shockman, though it later saw re-release on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service on Wii and Wii U.
The Satellaview was an early digital download platform for the Super Famicom, which meant that after that service went offline, the title was no longer available. However, it got re-released in cartridge format via Columbus Circle in 2017. You can still find it available in some places if you’ve got a Super Famicom to stick it in.

Shockman Zero is a delicious mix of Mega Man-style platformer and beat-’em-up. It’s as if the Blue Bomber defeated Fist Man and learned to throw hands. It has a distinct Japanese flavor that reminds me of Gunstar Heroes. It’s also a co-op, so you can smite baddies with a friend.
The translation comes courtesy of homebrewers Svambo and Anonymousse However, as this was a Japanese-only release previously, this might be the closest we ever get to an official translation. That is, unless a publisher wants to assemble all these games in a collection, which you could absolutely count me on board for. Stranger things have happened, like the upcoming Jajamaru Collections, for example.

                              <span>As of today, you can get two select games again for $99.98
Remember Switch game vouchers? The gist is that Nintendo provides a sizable discount (roughly $20) for buying two select games on the Switch eShop. Of course, there&#x27;s the understanding that the selection is limited, the promo is digital only, and the vouchers can be redeemed for 12 months &quot;from the date of purchase.&quot; Not every applicable title is $60 flat either, so you might end up spending $100 to get two $50 games when all is said and done.
Eligible games include a few heavy-hitting recent AAA titles like Splatoon 3, Bayonetta 3, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, and Fire Emblem Engage: as well as upcoming games like Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Select third party games are on the list too, like Octopath Traveler. You can find a…</span>

PQube has announced that it will be handling the western release of Inti Creates&#x27; Gothic Gals with Guns actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge — The publisher will launch the cool-looking title digital on consoles on February 24, with a range of physical releases also in the works.
Standard boxed editions of Demon Purge will be made available on PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch platforms this spring, while a special Collector&#x27;s Edition is expected to launch in summer 2023. This latter edition will include a boxed physical edition of the game on PlayStation or Switch, alongside a 40-page artbook, a sticker set and key ring, art cards, and even a fun origami set, representing the magic of our monster-mashing Kazimono sisters, Shinobu and Maya.

Grim Guardians: Demon Purge is a pixelated 2D adventure that marries a Castlevania&#x27;s Gothic aesthetic with the run &#x27;n&#x27; gun chaos of a Gunvolt. One or two players will lead the Kazimono sisters deep into the dark dungeons of a demonic castle, determined to purge its evil from their village school. Younger sibling Maya will be looking to bring down a battalion of hellish opponents with her lethal *checks notes* origami skills, while her older sister Shinobu is, somewhat more traditionally, going with good old-fashioned lead — delivered accurately and with speed.

Inti Creates&#x27; stylish-looking title shifted onto my radar at the end of the era, thanks to its cool pixelated visuals, cheesecake anime style, and interesting mix of magic and bombastic action. I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on this one, and I will hopefully find the time and opportunity to check it out for all of you folks right here at the good ship Destructoid. Lock &#x27;n&#x27; load... and fold, I guess.
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Full Scarlet &amp; Violet support is still on the way
The last time Pokemon Home got a major update was all the way back in October, but as of today, version 2.1.0 has hit mobile devices. This February 1, 2023 update addresses Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, but it doesn&#x27;t quite add full Home support just yet.
Primarily, it looks at adding ranked battle info in the mix, as well as battle results from Sword &amp; Shield (remember those?!). The catch is that you&#x27;ll need to link your Home account to a Nintendo account with data from the newest generation: otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to view said data. This is alongside of the typical &quot;other issues/various fixes&quot; vaguery in many AAA franchise patch notes.
As a reminder, full Scarlet &amp; Violet access is still on track for &quot;spring 2023&quot; according to several listings on The Pokemon Company websites. It can&#x27;t come soon enough! So far in terms of &quot;off book&quot; Pokemon releases we&#x27;ve gotten Charizard, Cinderace, and Greninja: as well as the full evolutionary lines for all three.
Pokemon Home version 2.1.0 full patch notes:
Added Ranked Battles information from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to the Battle Data feature.
If you&#x27;ve linked Pokémon HOME to a Nintendo Account with data from Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you&#x27;ll now be able to view results from your Ranked Battles in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.
You can view your battle results from Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield by choosing View Past Battle Records.
Other issues have also been addressed in order to ensure a user-friendly experience.

                              <span>You got Wang
Devolver Digital has announced that the latest entry in the Shadow Warrior series is getting a glow-up in the form of a definitive edition on February 16. Bringing forth some performance upgrades and new features, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition could be seen as the next-gen version. Existing owners of Shadow Warrior 3 will be getting a free upgrade to the new version.
Originally released in 2022, Shadow Warrior 3 took series protagonist Lo Wang back to his single-player roots after the more four-player co-op-focused Shadow Warrior 2. While it’s a more linear take than Flying Wild Hog’s previous games in the revival series, it introduced more movement options with dashing and wall-running.

The headlining features are a survival mode, hardcore difficulty, and new game plus. Survival mode unlocks after you’ve beaten the main storyline and offers up some weapon skins if you can, uh… survive. Hardcore difficulty is, as the name suggests, a more challenging way to play through the game. Meanwhile, New Game Plus is a little less clear, with Devolver Digital saying that it allows you to “Enjoy additional challenges, rewards, and skins to give Lo-Wang that much-needed confidence boost.” They haven’t really said if you get to keep your upgrades for the second playthrough.
Along with these additions is hero mode, which introduces a life system to the gameplay. There is also a chapter selection, allowing you to replay your favorite slices of the game.
In terms of stepping up to the current generation of consoles, on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, there will be a performance mode for 60fps gameplay, or you can trade that for 4K visuals and 30fps.
Shadow Warrior 3 is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. The Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition upgrade will add native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions to the mix on February 16, 2023.

Of all of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s new World Warriors, perhaps none has quite made the impact on social media as the mountainous warrior and lover of all things beautiful, Marisa. Ever since Street Fighter fans first saw her in action, Marisa fast became one of the most talked-about characters, complete with a vast array of fan art and more than few fluttering hearts.
An Italian woman of Greek ancestry, Marisa (Ma-Ritz-ah) claims to have lineage traced to the warriors of old, reflected in her stoic visual appearance, golden laureled gear, and the biggest case of literal &quot;helmet hair&quot; in history. But, despite her domineering smash-mouth appearance, Marisa works in the intricate arts, creating jewelry for the fashion market. With Marisa, Manon, JP, and Kimberly, one can cert…</span>

The release of WWE 2K23 is fast approaching its March 17, 2023 date with retail, and to get you in the suplexing mood, 2K Sports has released a trailer showing off its WarGames mode. This mode features two rings, side-by-side within a steel cage, and has two teams facing off with each other with three or four members a piece. The members of each team are let into the cage in an alternating fashion, and the winning team is decided by pinfall or submission once everyone is inside.
WarGames started off with Jim Crockett Promotions, which would become WCW. It would continue appearing throughout WCW’s run, which ended in 2001 when WWE (WWF at the time) bought them out. WarGames was then brought back in 2017 with the NXT brand, albeit with some minor changes.

With the inclusion of two rings, this is actually a pretty big addition to the series. I expect to see many limitations in terms of what venue and mode it can be played in, but it could be a fun way to mix up multi-player. I just don’t want to see what the load times look like when you have two teams full of custom wrestlers.
More importantly, though, the trailer shows that “Macho Man” Randy Savage is once again on the roster this year for WWE 2K23. He looks about the same as he did in WWE 2K22, but my enthusiasm for the release would be significantly diminished if he wasn’t in it.
WWE 2K23 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on March 17, 2023. It will arrive in Standard, Deluxe, and Icon Edition flavors.

Microsoft has chosen to remind us of the ephemeral nature of digital games by announcing that they’ll be delisting 46 games from the Xbox 360 Marketplace on February 7th.
Thankfully, most of these titles are already available elsewhere or in a physical format. If they’re available on the Xbox One or Series X|S marketplace, they will remain available there. Also, if you have already purchased them, you will still have access to them after their removal through your download history.
The list of affected games are:
Aegis Wing
Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood
Assassin’s Creed III
Assassin’s Creed IV
Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD
Blood of the Werewolf
Blue Dragon
Breakdown
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare
Call of Duty: Ghosts
Castle Crashers
Cloning Clyde
Counter-Strike: GO
Dark Souls
Darksiders II
DAYTONA USA
Defense Grid
Eets: Chowdown
Far Cry 2
Final Fight: Double Impact
Iron Brigade
Jeremy McGrath’s Offroad
Jet Set Radio
Left 4 Dead
Left 4 Dead 2
LIMBO
Lost Odyssey
Mass Effect 2
MONOPOLY DEAL
Mutant Blobs Attack
N+
Outpost Kaloki X
Peggle 2
Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds
Prince of Persia
R.U.S.E.
Sega Vintage Collection: Alex Kidd &amp; Co.
Skate 2
South Park: The Stick of Truth
Spelunky
Splinter Cell: Conviction
Star Wars: Battlefront
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2
The Orange Box
The Raven: Episode 1
The Witcher 2
It’s perhaps not a surprise that Microsoft would eventually look to sunset the Xbox 360 Marketplace, but it’s a sad reality. Better solutions need to be brought forward to preserve digital-only titles. But for now, if you want digital versions of these titles in your library, you’ve got about a week to jump on them.
More details can be found through Microsoft&#x27;s official support.

                              <span>EA and FIFA set to part ways
Electronic Arts announced its financial earnings for its third quarter of the fiscal year, revealing that the latest, and last, entry in its long-running FIFA franchise, FIFA 23, is on track to be the best-selling release in the franchise&#x27;s entire history.
Speaking in a conference call, transcribed by VGC, EA CEO Andrew Wilson noted that North American sales of the football sim are up a huge 50% on last year&#x27;s release, and as such the title is &quot;pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history&quot;. As we previously reported, Electronic Arts FIFA 23 had an incredible launch week, racking up an incredible 10.3 million players within one week of its September 30, 2022 launch date.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0tIW1X2dv0c&amp;vl&#x3D;en&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;EASPORTSFIFA
In a strange irony, what could prove to be the most successful Electronic Arts FIFA title of all time will also be the last collaboration between the game publisher and international football&#x27;s statutory body. As of next year, Electronic Arts will launch its new brand, EA Sports FC, while the Federation Internationale de Football Association itself is hoping to find success with its own football simulation series.
Despite the insistence by FIFA president Gianni Infantino that the new, official FIFA game will be &quot;the only authentic, real game&quot;, and &quot;best one available for gamers and football fans&quot;, I think we know where the development talent and marketing savvy really lie. And, given the skyrocketing success of FIFA 23, The FIFA federation may soon regret pricing itself out of one of — if not the — most consistently performing franchise in the entire history of video games.
FIFA 23 is available now on  PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Update 1.03
I haven&#x27;t really been having much trouble with Dead Space on PS5 (outside of a few times I had to reload checkpoints); but folks have reported issues with stuttering on several platforms, as well as out-there problems like Twitch streaming bugs or various PC graphical anomalies. While the development team is tracking all known issues here, the recent 1.03 patch addresses some problems on PC and PS5 (with Xbox arriving later this week).
EA has been fairly vague with what patch 1.03 fixes exactly, but suffice to say many players have been responding positively to it. This is especially the case on PC, where the option to disable VRS alone has helped the stability of that platform tremendously.
Full Dead Space 1.03 patch notes
Disabling VRS is now possible on PC
Addressed PS5 stuttering
Addressed the black screen bug
General stability and performance fixes
A Dead Space Reddit community member has also provided a workaround for PC stuttering issues, if you&#x27;re still having them:
Making sure power profile is set to AMD Performance Mode (it stutters on AMD Balanced)
Disabling Exploit Protection in Windows for &quot;Dead Space.exe&quot; (need to add exception)This is very common resolution of stuttering in DX12 games, Horizon Zero Dawn had the same problem.
Disable GPU scheduling (I&#x27;ve checked that during game GPU load is ~90% while CPU is ~60%, so I guess it&#x27;s fine to do scheduling on CPU)
Disabling Adobe Creative Cloud

                              <span>It&#x27;ll be tough to match the excellence of Tomb Raider GO
Yesterday, we told you about the upcoming Street Fighter game that&#x27;s launching on mobile. Today, it&#x27;s Tomb Raider&#x27;s turn. Lara Croft is set to return to iOS and Android devices this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded. Featuring the voice talents of Keeley Hawes and a look that harkens back to the golden era of this franchise, Reloaded sees gaming&#x27;s most famous treasure hunter pillaging more ancient ruins in search of stuff to keep at her mansion. This time around, the locations she&#x27;ll explore–which include famous locations like St. Francis&#x27; Folly and the Lost Valley–are procedurally generated. That&#x27;s right, this game is a roguelike, and as you can see from the Tomb Raider Reloaded trailer below, it doesn&#x27;t look too bad.

After having Lara Croft go through more &quot;realistic&quot; adventures, it&#x27;s nice to see her back doing what she does best: fighting dinosaurs. Developed by Emerald City Games in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics – Eidos, Tomb Raider Reloaded will feature all the acrobatics Lara Croft is known for, as well as classic enemies, traps, and puzzles. Players will be able to upgrade Lara with new equipment and XP, and like every other free-to-play game on mobile, the developers hope to keep you booting the game up daily with events and challenges. Cellist Tina Guo, who was a featured soloist on the Grammy-nominated Journey soundtrack, is spearheading orchestral recordings of classic Tomb Raider songs for the game.
Tomb Raider Reloaded will launch worldwide on February 14, 2023. You can download it for iOS or Android, and if you have a Netflix subscription, you can access the game without any of the ads and microtransactions found in the free-to-play version.

                              <span>Maybe this&#x27;ll reinvigorate the game for a lot of people
Exotic (unique) weapons in the Destiny series have always been a way to add more flavor into the game: and that&#x27;s especially the case with marquee expansion-centric exotics. Bungie just showed off seven more that are arriving in the mix with the Lightfall expansion, and things look promising so far: especially from an aesthetic perspective.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;7&quot; size&#x3D;&quot;medium&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;360761,360762,360763,360764,360765,360766,360767&quot;]
Here are the exotics shown off in the newest Destiny 2: Lightfall trailer, as well as how they work:
Final Warning (Charged tracking rounds)
Deterministic Chaos (Rhythmic debuffs)
Cyrtarachne&#x27;s Facade (Grappple gives woven mail)
Abeyant Leap (Barricade spawns additional lashes)
Quicksilver Storm (Grenades create tangles on kills)
Swarmers (Destroying tangles spawns threadlings)
Winterbite (Freeze enemies with frost orb)
Expect more exotics to show up as the seasons progress, as well as raid-specific gear that will be kept secret until the raid itself hits.

Keep moving forward
Looking back on the last few years of Destiny, it&#x27;s been a wild ride. One of the most off-the-rails tracks was definitely Destiny&#x27;s foray into the Stadia realm (with hiccups): followed by its recent crash. I know some of the playerbase has been worn out by the last few expansions, but the vibrant neon hues of Lightfall could go a long way in terms of bringing me back.
We&#x27;ll see how it turns out on February 28!

Capcom has updated its &quot;Platinum List&quot; depicting the veteran studio&#x27;s best-selling title titles of all time — And despite several position swaps, the list&#x27;s Top 20 remains completely dominated by two of the publisher&#x27;s most consistent and loved franchises: Resident Evil and Monster Hunter.
Various entries in the premier survival horror franchise take up a total of seven slots in the Top 20, spearheaded by 2017&#x27;s Resident Evil 7: Biohazard at No.3, 2019&#x27;s Resident Evil 2 at No.4, and 2009&#x27;s Resident Evil 5 at No.6. The series&#x27; most recent entry, 2021&#x27;s Resident Evil Village, sits at No.8 with an impressive 7.4 million total sales.
For a franchise once considered niche, there&#x27;s no denying Monster Hunter&#x27;s incredible success. The fantasy franchise takes up an amazi…</span>

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: After the explosive shadow drop of HI-FI Rush, a trending topic across socials has been short video games. I thought this would be a great opening topic after the recent releases of High on Life, The Callisto Protocol, Evil West, along with HI-FI Rush. All of which have caught some flak for their lengths. Along with this topic, the Spot Dodge crew discusses Nintendo&#x27;s 2023 and the games they&#x27;re playing.

The brawling battle royale Rumbleverse is closing down. Today, Iron Galaxy Studios and Epic Games confirm that Season Two will mark the last one for Rumbleverse, as the brawler goes offline on February 28.
In a new blog, Iron Galaxy outlines the overall shutdown procedure. The final update for Rumbleverse will roll out today, which will close the store and open the full experience to every player. The current Battle Pass will be given to everyone, and XP gains will be doubled. Quads, Trios, Duos, and Solos will all be live, and the team has unlocked some additional emotes and accessories as well.
&quot;There is still fun we can have together before the sun sets on Grapital City,&quot; the team said in today&#x27;s blog. &quot;The remaining weeks will be a chance to celebrate the compe…</span>

Electronic Arts is shuttering development on two of its mobile projects. Apex Legends Mobile is shutting down, and development on Battlefield Mobile is coming to a halt.
In an update posted today, the publisher characterized this as a &quot;strategic decision.&quot; In regards to Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the strong start, the &quot;ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations&quot; of players, and a mutual decision was made to sunset the mobile game. Apex Mobile was in development with Tencent subsidiary Lightspeed Studios.
Meanwhile, Battlefield Mobile was still in development. The decision was made to pivot from the current direction towards one that will &quot;best deliver&quot; on EA&#x27;s vision for the Battlefield franchise.

                              <span>Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. 
In an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn&#x27;t provide a reason for why it&#x27;s closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox&#x27;s Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: 
Batman: Arkham Knight
Battlefield 1
Bloodborne
Call of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy
Days Gone
Detroit: Become Human
Fallout 4
Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition
God of War (2018)
Infamous: Second Son
The Last Guardian
The Last of Us Remastered
Monster Hunter: World
Mortal Kombat X
Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)
Resident Evil VII: Biohazard
Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End
Until Dawn
Last year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven&#x27;t already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.</span>

Hi-Fi Rush occupies an increasingly rare space in the big-budget video game industry: that of colorful, goofy, and light-hearted titles. For its 10 or 11-hour runtime, it has more in common with a Saturday morning cartoon than a thin attempt at gritty, prestige television, like most triple-A games these days, and that&#x27;s easily its biggest strength. That its gameplay and combat are a unique melding of rhythm and stylish action games is merely the cherry on top.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, the next installment in the psychological survival horror franchise, arrives on May 16 instead of its original March window. 
The Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.


You can check out Amnesia: The Bunker on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

These are the four games all PlayStation Plus subscribers can add to their libraries starting next week on February 7, not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus games catalog that varies depending on the tier of subscription you have. 
Here&#x27;s what PlayStation has to say about each of these games:
Evil Dead: The Game | PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4
Game Informer&#x27;s Evil Dead: The Game review
OlliOlli World
Game Informer&#x27;s OlliOlli World review
Destiny 2: Beyond Light
Game Informer&#x27;s Destiny 2: Beyond Light review
Mafia: Definitive Edition
Game Informer&#x27;s Mafia: Definitive Edition review
All four of these games will be available to PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium members from February 7 until March 6. You have until February 6 to add last month&#x27;s games – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 – to your library. 
Elsewhere in today&#x27;s announcement, PlayStation announced that the PlayStation Plus Collection, which PS5 owners subscribed to Plus have had access to since 2020, will no longer be offered starting May 9. 
&quot;If you haven&#x27;t redeemed the titles in this collection yet, you can still do so until May 9, which will enable you to access those titles even after this date for as long as you remain a PlayStation Plus member.&quot;

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is finally out next week, after multiple delays that pushed it out of its original 2021 release date to 2023. And you can prepare the game&#x27;s release with a new gameplay launch trailer released by developer Avalanche Software today. 
The trailer features roughly two and a half minutes of new Hogwarts Legacy footage, including a mix of both cinematics from the game and gameplay. We see Hogsmeade, professors, students, and plenty of Hogwarts, of course. 
Check it out for yourself in the Hogwarts Legacy launch trailer below: 


&quot;Hogwarts Legacy invites players to embark on an epic journey as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts, gifted with a rare ability to tap into ancient, powerful magic,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Guided by the Wizard&#x27;s Field Guide and unique instruction from professors and other characters, fans will uncover a compelling storyline filled with thrilling challenges and mysteries.&quot;
For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month ,and then watch this cinematic tour of the Hogwarts castle grounds. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that.
Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game), and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4. The Switch version of the game will be released on July 25.</span>

                              <span>Valiant Hearts: Coming Home, the sequel to 2014&#x27;s Valiant Hearts: The Great War, is now available to play for all Netflix members. 
This Netflix-exclusive game can be played by any subscriber on iOS and Android devices. The sequel brings players back to World War I &quot;for a dramatic narrative game following four interweaving stories of friendship, survival, and sacrifice amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war.&quot; Valiant Hearts: The Great War was a surprise hit back in 2014, garnering attention and storytelling praise from critics and players alike. 
Check out the Valiant Hearts: Coming Home release trailer below: 


&quot;James joins the Harlem Hellfighters to search for his heroic older brother Freddie, while Anna tends to the wounded and broken,&quot; a press release about the game reads. &quot;Ernst, a German driver, and George, a British aviator, each face their own challenges, and Walt, the canine companion from the first game, is back to aid players in their progress through exploration, puzzle-solving, and action sequences.&quot; 
Ubisoft says original core members that worked on Valiant Hearts: The Great War at Ubisoft Montepllier in 2014 have returned to develop Valiant Hearts: Coming Home in collaboration with Old Skull Games.
This is the first of three Ubisoft mobile games coming to Netflix. The next game is Mighty Quest, which is also due out this year and will bring Netflix subscribers a &quot;roguelite-inspired hack-and-slash adventure.&quot; The third game will be an Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile game to coincide with Netflix&#x27;s live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

                              <span>Electronic Arts is ending development on both Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile. It is shuttering Battlefield Mobile developer Industrial Toys as well. 
This news was part of EA&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2023 Q3 financial results released yesterday, in which the company revealed that it is also delaying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to April.
EA says it is ending Battlefield Mobile, which hadn&#x27;t been fully released yet (although many had played through betas), as part of a &quot;pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players.&quot; The company adds that it is hard at work evolving Battlefield 2042, which launched to disappointment from fans, and in &quot;pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe.&quot; 
As for Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the game&#x27;s strong start, &quot;the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations&quot; of its players. 
&quot;At Respawn, we aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding,&quot; a statement from Respawn reads. &quot;Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence. It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.&quot; 
All real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game&#x27;s shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game. EA says it will not be providing refunds for money spent on Apex Legends Mobile in its FAQ, which answers other questions you might have here.

                              <span>Revisiting Minecraft to discuss whether it deserved the GOTY award back in 2010 is a hard task, in the same way that discussing the importance of sliced bread is hard. It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.
In fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft. If everyone brings one thing, we can have a show-and-tell.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running out of pictures to use when I write about Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams because I&#x27;ve only completed two puzzles in it. I&#x27;ve been doing the third one for about a year, because it&#x27;s, I think, six thousand pieces. I say &quot;i think&quot; because it&#x27;s been long enough that I can&#x27;t remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it&#x27;s a lot of thousand.
I really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they&#x27;re quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.

                              <span>Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there&#x27;s some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone.

                              <span>I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.
Pentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati&#x27;s vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati&#x27;s humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.

                              <span>As someone who considers Uniqlo an extravagance, the HTC Vive XR Elite might just be the most expensive thing I’ll ever wear. Revealed at CES 2023 and set for launch in March, this is the first Vive VR headset in years with real PC gaming credentials, while borrowing from the more compact design of the mobile VR-minded Vive Flow VR glasses. I recently went to try them out over here in London, with an uneasy thought in my mind: even with a lighter design than the Vive Cosmos series, how could this possibly be worth £1299 / $1099?

Instead of focusing on one theme and yapping on about it for a very long time, we&#x27;re now splitting the pod into two segments: the first half on the hip and happening, the second on an FPS genre or subgenre that we&#x27;re unfamiliar with. Our first port of call? theHunter: Call Of The Wild.
In our first sessions with the game, we both concluded that A) deer are incredibly athletic; and B) we&#x27;re the most impatient people, perhaps ever. More than that, though, we hadn&#x27;t realised how important it was to fixate on your prey. Not like, track them down. But like, track them down, you know?

                              <span>A Bloomberg report from yesterday has revealed new details on the state of the Halo franchise and the turmoil at developer 343 Industries. This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days&#x27; notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development.

                              <span>Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.
“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”


When the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release.

                              <span>Epic Games and Iron Galaxy have announced they’re sunsetting their melee battle royale Rumbleverse, six months after launch. Live services will go offline on February 28th at 4PM GMT/10AM CST/11AM ET. In a blog post from the team, Iron Galaxy shared that Season Two will be Rumbleverse’s last, but it should be receiving one final update soon to remove the game&#x27;s monetisation. This continues the trend of me discovering a new battle royale game, thanks to the announcement of its death.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played Shiny Shoe&#x27;s upcoming roguelike Inkbound once before, and not only is it markedly different to their previous game Monster Train, but it also featured the snappiest turn-based combat I&#x27;d seen. With that in mind, I dove into the game&#x27;s recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn&#x27;t come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.

Look at you, freely using all the full range of tools at your disposal, not living in fear of the future, living a life glorious and full of fireworks than stocking up to do it all over again. I can&#x27;t be you, but I&#x27;m happy for you. This week, you must chose between vivacious violence and virtual reality. What&#x27;s better: mixed dual-wielding, or VR support?

In a series of Twitter posts, Activision announced a new, free-to-play “small map” called Ashika Island. Warzone’s new map will feature a brand new mode DMZ, alongside the returning mode Resurgence - a slimmer BR that cuts the lobby size down from 150 to 50 players, and enables respawns. Ashika Island and the new modes will launch alongside Season 02 on February 15th.

Feel like you&#x27;ve played one too many dull Doom clones in your time to really be bothered trying another? Well, may we suggest you get your glad rags on and give Mopeful Games&#x27; Fashion Police Squad a whirl, it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous, darling!
Sashaying onto Switch in a very silly burst of colour and humour, this is a quirky delight of an indie first-person shooter that starts off feeling a little too basic but gradually adds enough components to its core gameplay to make it well worth getting stuck into.

If you&#x27;re on the lookout for bright and bubbly games about exploring a colourful world and making friends in a small town, then boy is this year a good one for you. But today we&#x27;re talking about Mika and the Witch&#x27;s Mountain, a fantasy adventure game about a delivery witch who carts packages around on her broom.
If this gives you Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service vibes, then ding ding ding, you nailed it — there&#x27;s more than a little bit of Ghibli magic built into the DNA of Mika and the Witch&#x27;s Mountain. But with Wind Waker-like art and a cast of diverse characters to befriend over the course of this coming-of-age journey, there&#x27;s evidently more than enough of its own special sauce that hundreds of people have already backed the game on Kickstarter less than 24 hours after its launch.

Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Scott ponders how Mario&#x27;s nemesis number 2 deserves more respect...

In the conversation of all-time great video games you have many Nintendo faces who show up near enough every time; Super Metroid, Ocarina of Time, most main-series Super Mario games. And while all of those live up to their high praise and deserve to be mentioned amongst the greats, there are many Nintendo titles that unjustly don&#x27;t get mentioned in that conversation. Games like Rhythm Paradise Megamix and Kid Icarus: Uprising, which — despite them being tremendous experiences — very rarely make the cut. While I could argue with you over how fantastic those two games are, I’m here to talk about another, which, despite a cult following and even receiving very positive review scores at the time, is rarely brought up in all-timer conversations: Wario Land 4.

                              <span>The DK drama continues.
New evidence has been uncovered that suggests Billy Mitchell did indeed cheat to attain his record-breaking Donkey Kong scores — the ones which Twin Galaxies removed from its record boards because they were allegedly achieved via emulation rather than original arcade hardware, and for which Mitchell is suing the record-keeping company.
As revealed by Karl Jobst on YouTube in the video at the top of the page, previously unseen photographic evidence shows what appears to be a non-original, potentially eight-way joystick as opposed to the four-way stick of the original cabinet. This difference makes it easier to perform certain moves and would give anyone using it an unfair advantage over someone using original hardware.

                              <span>Hey! Look! Listen!
The Zelda timeline is a difficult beast to get your head around. There are various different threads with Link at a different stage in his heroism, things that are canon and non-canon and always the promise that the next game could come along and shift everything about (we&#x27;re looking at you, Tears of the Kingdom).
For the most part, the timeline excludes most of the Zelda spin-off sources (TV shows, manga, graphic novels and the like), though this isn&#x27;t to say that there are no interesting facts to be gained from these formats. Take the following images from &#x27;The Perfect Zelda Fan Book&#x27;, a Japanese guide for A Link to the Past which also contains a short manga for the first three games in the series.

                              <span>Crate expectations.
If you&#x27;ve been in the biz of reading game reviews for a while, you&#x27;ll know that an Edge 9/10 is about as rare as a calendar month without a Nintendo Direct rumour. But voxel crate-burning puzzle game Bonfire Peaks managed it, impressing Edge&#x27;s reviewers with its 100+ puzzles and gorgeous island ruins. Forgive us for not getting our own review up — we must have burned the review crate by accident...
Bonfire Peaks is now getting a three-part DLC pack called Lost Memories, which will be released episodically throughout 2023. Part One, which is roughly a quarter the length of the base game, will arrive on Switch on March 2nd, with the second and third parts following later this year.

Má pomoci nejen učitelům zjistit, zda je daný text dílem člověka či umělé inteligence. OpenAI upozorňuje na to, že nástroj zatím není dokonalý a výsledky jeho zpracování závisejí mimo jiné na tom, zda je zkoumaný text podobný materiálům, na kterých byla analýza trénována. Může docházet k falešným pozitivitám i negativitám, takže by nemělo jít o jediný zdroj, dle kterého bude zkoumaný text posuzován.</span>

                              <span>The Last of Us inspired no shortage of takes when it first released back in 2013. The HBO TV adaptation has been no different. Like a massive EpiPen of stimulus for the take economy in the middle of winter, it has elicited both over-the-top praise, scornful dismissals, and everything in-between. But what is…

                              <span>The Sims 4 didn&#x27;t have toddlers until they were added in 2017, and sims&#x27; early years will continue to telescope when March comes around. That&#x27;s when infants will finally be added to the game, turning babies into full sims.

The latest update also offered news on Project Rene, the eventual successor to The Sims 4. The key takeaways: it&#x27;s not an MMO but it will have multiplayer as well as singleplayer, and it&#x27;s years away from release.

In a statement released on Twitter, developers Respawn Entertainment said that the action-adventure sequel would no longer meet its March 17th release date and will instead draw laser swords on April 28th.

If those two games were to come together in a high speed collision, the mangled wreckage might look like The Crew Motorfest, Ubisoft&#x27;s newly announced game about a racing festival on the island of O&#x27;ahu. The reveal trailer is below.

                              <span>Marvel Snap is several rare things at once: a licensed superhero game that&#x27;s fun; a card game that&#x27;s graspable and allows for casual play; and a free-to-play game that doesn&#x27;t feel warped by microtransations.

As of today, it now has a PvP battle mode to enable friends to pit their decks against one another. It&#x27;s either making a good thing better, or it&#x27;s the beginning of the end of all the things I mentioned above.

                              <span>Portable SSDs are jolly useful for quickly transferring large files, like Steam game file backups or 4K videos, from device to device. I&#x27;ve said before in similar blogs that I use one to ferry videos from my computer downstairs to my TV, but I also rely on one to quickly set up a PC for performance testing and copy game files to my Steam Deck. 
In any case, you&#x27;d normally expect to pay anywhere from £70 to £100 for a 1TB drive of a decent spec, but today you can pick up Integral&#x27;s 1TB USB-C Portable SSD for £59.99 at MyMemory. To get this price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HMMJSU at the checkout.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s WH-1000XM line of noise-cancelling headphones is brilliant - I&#x27;ve used a pair of XM4s while working for years - and they&#x27;re actually pretty decent for PC gaming too, especially if you&#x27;re in a louder environment. That&#x27;s why I thought I should tell you that these WH-1000XM5s are discounted to £249 on Sony&#x27;s UK site when you use code UPGRADE50 to knock £50 off the price. This is the first time they&#x27;ve dropped to this level, and for a go-anywhere set of headphones they might just be worth a look.

                              <span>Dead Space’s remake treatment has produced a piece of gory greatness, some Steam Deck wobbles notwithstanding. Vid bud Liam touched on the visual upgrades in his review, but since it’s been shaking my bones even harder than the original did, I wanted to dive even deeper into the mottled flesh of the modernised Dead Space to examine how all those new polygons and effects aren’t just there to please nerds. They do, in fact, make the remake scarier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There&#x27;s the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she&#x27;s the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she&#x27;s more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there&#x27;s the youngest, who&#x27;s extremely likeable, in large part because she&#x27;s learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she&#x27;s modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn&#x27;t really forged her own identity.
Then there&#x27;s Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he&#x27;s just a bit gawky. He&#x27;s experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it&#x27;s only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

                              <span>Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It&#x27;s the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s &quot;words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,&quot; and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

                              <span>The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We&#x27;ve been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

                              <span>Whomst among us hasn&#x27;t dreamt of somehow being transported to a magical world, where there are talking unicorns, and you can throw lightning and control plants because you are this universe&#x27;s very special hero? Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I&#x27;d be a bit disappointed. It&#x27;s all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn&#x27;t much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it&#x27;s over; I didn&#x27;t pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I&#x27;d be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn&#x27;t happen much, and isn&#x27;t contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you&#x27;ve seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

                              <span>A series of senior job listings have revealed some details about The Molasses Flood’s upcoming Witcher game, codenamed Project Sirius. The studio behind Flame In The Flood were acquired by CD Projekt Red back in 2021, and CDPR first mentioned Sirius in an investor call last October. The project was initially described as &quot;an innovative take on The Witcher universe telling an unforgettable story.” We now know that this “unforgettable story” could potentially be told inside of a multiplayer game, or at least a game with multiplayer and social elements.

You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

Respawn is taking a little extra time to work on Cal Kestis&#x27; return. Electronic Arts and Respawn confirm today that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has been pushed back by six weeks, and will now launch on April 28, 2023.
Previously set for March 17, the development team at Respawn confirms today that Jedi: Survivor is content complete. The developer is now focused on the final stage of bug fixes, stability, and polish, and it&#x27;s looking to take a little extra time to do so.
&quot;Jedi: Survivor is a direct response to the feedback from our community, delivering expansive destinations to explore, evolved combat and traversal, and of course, the continuation of Cal Kestis and BD&#x27;s story,&quot; reads today&#x27;s statement. &quot;Making this game has truly us a better te…</span>

If you have your eye on Street Fighter 6 newcomer Manon, then you aren&#x27;t alone, as the dancer, model, and martial arts master has turned more than a few heads since she made her presence known as part of the upcoming scrapper&#x27;s roster — Capcom released a new matchup of the French fighter in action, alongside the debut of her in-game theme.
https://youtu.be/nkmtV54XsJo
You can check out the fight above, which sees Manon severely outweighed and outgunned by another SF6 newcomer, Marisa. Still, with a  mastery of poise and balance, as well as her innate acrobatic ability, Manon still manages to get more than her fair share of licks in — demonstrating her deceptive reach, a physics-defying arsenal of grabs and throws, and a frankly bizarre &quot;splits-slide&quot;.
Manon is definitely shaping up to be one of SF6&#x27;s most interesting newcomers, from both a design and gameplay perspective.
Manon - Walk With Grace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6k5XctUu0Dw&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;StreetFighter
Manon&#x27;s theme, &quot;Walk With Grace&quot; is a smooth, modern effort, clearly composed to reflect not only the character&#x27;s personality but also the many strings in her talented bow. The tune starts out with a melody as mysterious and as intriguing as the woman herself, before transitioning to a rhythmic &quot;stride&quot; — a beat that conjures up visions of confident models powerfully marching down a catwalk, or the red carpet. As a hybrid superstar, Manon has been afforded a tune that is a blend of her talents, synergizing together her celebrity status, her graceful motion, and her natural, somewhat aloof, sense of mystery.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, and Blanka and Dhalsim, in our previous articles.

The use of third-party tools in Final Fantasy XIV has been a hot-button issue for a while, and a recent clear of the MMO&#x27;s newest Ultimate content has breached the topic once again. Producer Naoki Yoshida published a letter today, addressing information surrounding &quot;concerning instances of unfair play&quot; within the XIV community.
In the letter from the producer, Yoshida cites the controversy surrounding the recent world-first clear of The Omega Protocol (Ultimate). Ultimates are Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s highest tier of content, and the race to be the first to clear it is intense, much like in other MMOs. The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) introduced in 6.31 is the latest, and saw top-level groups competing for days to try and get past the hurdl…</span>

Load up your boomstick and oil your chainsaw arm, as developer Saber Interactive has announced that its getting ready to launch an all-new gore-filled endeavor for its sloshy scrapper Evil Dead: The Game — The &quot;Splatter Royale&quot; mode will be launching on all platforms as soon as this Thursday, February 2.
Splatter Royale, as you might have guessed from the moniker, is Evil Dead&#x27;s unique take on the &quot;Last Person Standing&quot; Battle Royale genre enjoyed and popularized by such titles as Fortnite, PUBG, and Call of Duty Warzone. In the case of Ash Williams &amp; his wild-eyed, tool-toting pals, Splatter Royale will see up to 40 players come together to throwdown in a hyper-violent, sinner-takes-all massacre.
https://twitter.com/EvilDeadTheGame/status/1620200430532976641?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;bJM2_lv6cwemhDjJ77Q2KQ
Saber Interactive has not offered up much information about this new mode at the time of writing, but one can assume that Splatter Royale will allow players to choose from a selection of Evil Dead: The Game&#x27;s varied roster of survivors before fighting it out tooth, nail, and shovel in a bloodthirsty effort to be the mightiest Deadite slayer of them all. I got Mia!
Once Saber Interactive fully lifts the lid on Splatter Royale, we&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up on all of the head-cleaving details. Evil Dead: The Game is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Iron Galaxy’s Rumbleverse, its pro-wrestling-flavored battle royale, is shutting down next month, only seven months after its full launch last August. 
Though Iron Galaxy doesn’t plainly state the reason for Rumbleverse’s demise, a blog post somewhat hints that a lack of substantial players may have played a role, stating in part:
“When you work on a video game, you imagine the community that will show up to play it someday. For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”
Rumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. 
Rumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. 
In similar news, today Konami announced it&#x27;s turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.</span>

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment has delayed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but thankfully the wait won’t be terribly long. Instead of arriving on March 17, the game will now launch a little over a month later on April 28. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Respawn states the game is content complete, and it&#x27;s solely focusing on fixing bugs, ensuring stability, and polishing the experience as much as possible. The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more info on the game, check out our video discussion with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan as well as our most recent preview.</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last year that Guardians of the Galaxy and Peacemaker director James Gunn and Aquaman producer Peter Safran had been hired to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios. Since that reveal, DC fans have speculated what Gunn and Safran&#x27;s new DCU, as the duo is calling the new DC cinematic universe, will look like in the coming years. 
Gunn has teased on Twitter multiple times that he, Safran, and others were formulating their long-spanning plan for the DCU and now, today, the duo has pulled back the curtain on the first 10 projects. All 10 of these projects, which span across movies and TV, will be in Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters.

                              <span>Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.
“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”
Support for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.

Crimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty&#x27;s team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock&#x27;s team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn&#x27;t gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it&#x27;s safe to say that one of Konami&#x27;s &quot;various circumstances&quot; for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.
If you want to try it out, you&#x27;ve got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I&#x27;ve heard Among Us is good.
Do you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


&quot;Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,&quot; Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;re excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.</span>

                              <span>During the 2022 Game Awards, the team behind Dead Cells put out an animated teaser trailer announcing that the game’s next DLC expansion would be Castlevania-themed. It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content. Game Informer got the chance to speak with Evil Empire’s co-founder Benjamin Laulan and brand m…</span>

                              <span>Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries is reportedly switching from its own internal Slipspace Engine to Unreal Engine for some games in the future. 
This news comes from a Bloomberg report stating that the switch from Slipspace to Unreal will begin with a new game under the codename Tatanka, according to the publication&#x27;s sources who are familiar with 343&#x27;s plans. According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions. 


Bloomberg reports that future Halo games &quot;will also explore using the Unreal Engine,&quot; but that some within the studio are skeptical of dropping Slipspace entirely in favor of Epic Gam…</span>

Following a recent Bloomberg report that stated Sony had told supply partners to prepare for a reduction in display panel orders, alongside word that the company had halved its shipment forecast as a result of disappointing pre-order numbers, Sony has refuted the claim in a new statement to GamesIndustry.biz. 
The publication reports that &quot;PlayStation says it has not cut production numbers for its upcoming VR headset,&quot; touching on Bloomberg&#x27;s report. Playstation told GamesIndustry.biz that it is &quot;seeing enthusiasm from PlayStation fans for the upcoming launch, which includes more than 30 titles such as Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Call of the Mountain, and Resident Evil Village.&quot;

                              <span>In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II.

                              <span>Marvel Snap has taken the world by storm, but one glaring omission fans have asked for is the ability to battle friends instead of only random strangers. As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not often that you see an OLED TV for less than $800, and it&#x27;s even less common to see an OLED gaming monitor for that kind of a price - especially when it&#x27;s Gigabyte&#x27;s well-respected FO48U, a 48-in model that supports 4K 120Hz over HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort. It&#x27;s got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago. 
Now, you can pick it up for $729 at Newegg when you use code JAN2548, an outstanding deal for a monitor of this size and quality.

                              <span>The Corsair MP600 Pro is a great high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD, so to get the 1TB model for $155 at Newegg, a reasonable $45 off, is a deal worth writing about. As you&#x27;d hope from a drive of this calibre, this uses more expensive TLC NAND flash and has a DRAM cache, providing noticeably better sustained performance than QLC drives without a DRAM cache.

                              <span>Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.


“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

                              <span>Microsoft and Sony have been in a months-long back-and-forth over Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition and the issue of Call Of Duty exclusivity, and they’re not done yet. In a series of tweets published last Friday, Microsoft’s chief communications officer Frank X. Shaw said Sony were “briefing people in Brussels claiming Microsoft is unwilling to offer them parity for Call of Duty if we acquire Activision,&quot; but added that “Nothing could be further from the truth.” I would have thought that a legal venue would be a more appropriate place to air these grievances, but I suppose this gets the job done quicker. Either way, it’s a toffee popcorn-worthy accusation in the ongoing drama.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s not muck about here. Homeworld is essentially just Battlestar Galactica, if it were a real-time strategy game that jumped through a hyperspace gate exclusively onto PC. There&#x27;s still much more to Relic Entertainment&#x27;s sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld&#x27;s Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.

Hellcard will continue the story of Book Of Demons when it launches into Steam early access on February 16th, but instead of slicing up devil flesh in traditional hack and slash fashion, this time you&#x27;ll be building decks of cards to tackle each dungeon layer as a roguelike.

I’m too slow to decipher any of them myself, but I enjoy seeing a game’s community pick apart foreign symbols to uncover a game’s deep mysteries (Tunic’s musical language was especially fun.) Fortunately for me, players have already deciphered the ‘Indecipherable’ text log in the new Dead Space remake, revealing a poem that potentially hints toward the series’ future. Naturally, spoilers within.

                              <span>Footage purporting to be from Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s multiplayer alpha has appeared online. The leak surfaced on Reddit over the weekend, claiming to be from a &quot;very old alpha&quot; build from summer 2020. It&#x27;s an interesting watch, as while the world and robo dinos look like classic Horizon, the characters jumping around fighting them look a lot more stylised than their hyper-detailed mainline counterparts.

                              <span>I spent the past weekend flicking between the Dead Space remake on my PC, and the Dead Space remake on my Steam Deck. It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.
To be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.

                              <span>Keyboards are eternally horizontal, and moving or rotating them outside of their designated comfort zone feels like an affront to all that is good and right with the world. But that&#x27;s precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it&#x27;s a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe&#x27;s back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you&#x27;re once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.

                              <span>Lara Croft has seen her fair share of live-action adaptations, but this time she’s raiding the small screen with a Tomb Raider TV series and a film in development at Amazon. THR reported that the Emmy-winning Fleabag writer Pheobe Waller-Bridge is set to pen (and executive produce) the upcoming show, though there&#x27;s no word on who&#x27;s attached with the film. THR states that Amazon is looking to &quot;build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film.&quot; This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics&#x27; game is already in production, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.

                              <span>Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it&#x27;s injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players&#x27; troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite&#x27;s battle royale island with &quot;Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super&quot; on it this morning, alongside tomorrow&#x27;s date. This means we&#x27;ll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn&#x27;t make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here&#x27;s hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There&#x27;s also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake feels like a game of yesteryear, in both good and bad ways. It’s a nostalgic romp through themed levels that feel more inspired than just another platforming tour through Bikini Bottom. It does a great job highlighting why people that grew up with SpongeBob SquarePants loved the show, and why people still love it today. At its best, the gameplay is decently fun, but at its worst, it’s mindlessly dull. This, coupled with a few bugs, like one that caused music to disappear completely, or…</span>

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s live action One Piece series will set sail this year. 
The subscription streaming service revealed this news today with a new image and a poster for the upcoming pirate series based on the long-running (and extremely popular) manga and anime series, One Piece. The release year image features Monkey D. Luffy, played by Iñaki Godoy, raising his fist up in the air. You can see Netflix&#x27;s One Piece logo in the image below as well:

Alongside the image above, Netflix has also released a new poster for the series, which features, from left to right, Taz Skylar&#x27;s Sanji, Emily Rudd&#x27;s Nami, Godoy&#x27;s Luffy, Jacob Gibson&#x27;s Usopp, and Mackenyu&#x27;s Roronoa Zoro, standing on a beach in front of the crew&#x27;s ship, the Going Merry. Check it out below: 
While these two images (and the casting) look great, we still haven&#x27;t seen Netflix&#x27;s One Piece show in motion so here&#x27;s hoping we get a trailer sooner than later. One Piece begins sometime this year. 
While waiting for more, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of One Piece Odyssey, the recently released One Piece JRPG.

                              <span>The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. 
Wersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching&#x27;s family. 
In the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog&#x27;s 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. 
I miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU &amp; Naughty Dog family! 💔

Wersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv&#x27;s depiction of her character in HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us over the past two few weeks.

And they remind us a lot of Uncharted. 
This fictional news segment highlights the efforts of Spider-Man, Kratos, Ratchet and Clank, the Eikons of the upcoming game, Final Fantasy XVI, and more from other games like Gran Turismo 7 and Returnal. However, amidst the clips, there are two shots that show what appears to be a young woman in a mysterious cave holding a torch as she approaches an ancient relic, as first reported by Video Games Chronicle.

                              <span>Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario&#x27;s famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong. 
Released during one of yesterday&#x27;s big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we&#x27;ve seen before, before Mario hits a yellow &quot;?&quot; block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it&#x27;s useful in the game, that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case here as Rogen&#x27;s Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario&#x27;s reliance on it. 
Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: 


As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen&#x27;s character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can&#x27;t wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7.

The latest &#x27;dev thoughts&#x27; video from developers Hopoo Games demonstrates some of the new alternate attack abilities available for every character, from sniper shots to turning your enemies into food.

                              <span>Dead Space returns today with just a few tweaks from devs Motive Studio, and among these are a bevy of accessibility options. One noticeable standout is the option to receive a warning when something potentially sensitive or disturbing is about to happen during Isaac Clarke’s Necromorph-filled trek around the derelict, deadly USG Ishimura. Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.

You might think &quot;Alice, it seems like you&#x27;re making the time a guy shouted at you and threw jeans on the floor because they were too long for him everyone else&#x27;s problem, do you think you have some lingering resentment?&quot;, and my response is that you&#x27;ve made a really specific assumption there, I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Anyway, if working in retail was like running the shop in Kardboard Kings, then everyone would love it.

                              <span>You know what’s guaranteed to make me laugh every single time? A good visual gag in a cartoon. A little freak reading a newspaper, for instance. A hyper-realistic close-up of a character’s face. A weird rat, perhaps. Maybe it’s smoking a cigarette? Whimsical. I love it. This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that&#x27;s jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh. It’s good, but not without its issues.

                              <span>Ubisoft are working on two new Far Cry games, according to a new report, including the next mainline entry, Far Cry 7, and a standalone multiplayer offshoot from the series. Sources told Insider Gaming that the pair of games were originally just one project, but have since been split into separate single-player and multiplayer games. What could become Far Cry 7 is reportedly being referred to as Project Blackbird internally at Ubisoft, with the multiplayer game going by the moniker of Project Maverick. Both games are being developed with input from veteran Far Cry series developers Ubisoft Montréal.

                              <span>It turns out Forspoken has bigger problems than some badly-landing bantz. The PC version absolutely brutalises low-end hardware, an issue compounded by its high yet often unhelpful system requirements, and framerate drops and stuttering remain common even on some of the best graphics cards around. Your best chance of a smooth ride in Forspoken lies in lowering some graphics options, so I’ve been trying them all out to see which are the best settings to cut down – as well as which ones you can afford to keep high.

                              <span>We kick off 2023&#x27;s inaugural episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, by doing some - rare - forward thinking. That&#x27;s right, Hayden gets genuinely excited over a couple of his most anticipated FPS games of the year, and I realise that I&#x27;m less &quot;excited&quot; and more &quot;intrigued&quot; by what&#x27;s on offer. The consensus? We hope there are some strong surprises.
And we&#x27;ve started two new things! We&#x27;re breaking the pod into two segments for the foreseeable future, with one half focused on current FPS stuff, and the other on games less-travelled in the space. Our first target? Deer in theHunter: Call Of The Wild.

                              <span>Ooh, I&#x27;m glad this made it to a full release. Power of Ten has rattled around my PC since ... I want to say &quot;a year ago&quot;, but that could turn out to be any time in the last three years if I actually check. It didn&#x27;t quite push me over the &quot;Article Threshold&quot; back then, but having given it a proper go now it&#x27;s out of early access, it&#x27;s time.
You&#x27;re a little spaceship, with a simple but intriguing backstory, who&#x27;s appeared near an inhabited planet. A transmission asks you to repair their defensive shield before &quot;the Deadeye&quot; arrives to genocide them, which, uh, okay I think I know whose side I&#x27;m on here, game.

                              <span>Our Dead Space remake review and the associated excitement has me wanting to check out the sci-fi survival horror again, but not quite enough to pay £50 for a new version of a game I already own. So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable. If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here&#x27;s how to get the original working well on PC.

                              <span>Spooky indie pinball hit Demon’s Tilt passed me by in 2019, so I’m pleased the devs have decided to build on their bumper success with a sci-fi-flavoured sequel. Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Above the Berlin Samurai Museum&#x27;s gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&#x27;s remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I&#x27;ve come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
From what I&#x27;ve played of the game&#x27;s earliest portions, it&#x27;s Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don&#x27;t expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you&#x27;re a fan or a newcomer, it&#x27;s looking like it&#x27;ll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series.

Now, developers Behaviour Interactive have announced the FPS will see an open beta from February 6th to February 13th on Steam, ahead of its release in April. You’ll need to construct your own outpost to ward off other intrepid players who’re after your genes to splice, and set off on your own incursions to try the same yourself.

Mazin seems to think the second game would have to spread out across multiple seasons, like the tendrils of an infected.

                              <span>Dead Space’s Isaac Clarke is clearly a man of many talents. He’s a systems engineer by trade, so he knows his way around the dense innards of space vessels. He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!
But did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he&#x27;s recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac&#x27;s many talents and see what a hard worker he is.

The post-apocalyptic survival MMO was delayed from March to November this week as it turned out the devs hadn&#x27;t actually got the game trademarked, prompting accusations from within the game’s Discord and Reddit communities that it might not exist at all. Talking to IGN, Eduard and Aisen Gotovtsev insisted that the delay was necessary and had been planned before the game’s Steam store page was removed.

                              <span>An ancient piracy battle has reached its final verdict at the Dutch Supreme Court. After 14 years, defunct Usenet provider News-Service Europe has won its long-standing dispute with local anti-piracy group BREIN, which now has to pay €65,000 in legal fees. This is a bittersweet victory for the provider, which continued to fight despite shutting down over a decade ago.

                              <span>HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us is getting a second season.
Nearly three weeks after the premiere of the first episode, HBO has revealed that The Last of Us will return for a Season 2. Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn&#x27;t surprising because The Last of Us&#x27; premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network.

January 27, 2023
As for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it&#x27;s likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. 
Episode 3 of HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. 
While waiting for this week&#x27;s episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games.

                              <span>International Data Corporation (IDC) zveřejnila data týkající se prodejů telefonů v posledním čtvrtletí loňského roku. Meziroční srovnání kvartálů ukazuje, že došlo k velkému propadu prodejů o 18,3 %, což je nejprudší zaznamenaný propad za jedno čtvrtletí a zároveň to stahuje celkové meziroční prodeje o 11,3 %. Za celý loňský rok se prodalo 1,21 miliardy telefonů, což je nejnižší číslo od roku 2013. Ars Technica to označuje za katastrofu pro trh s telefony a jako příčinu uvádí celosvětově rostoucí inflaci a nezaměstnanost.</span>

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has dropped again on Amazon UK, this time to £200 when you buy stock from Amazon EU. That&#x27;s £20 below the next-best price and a fair deal for a strong eight-core 16-thread CPU for gaming and content creation.

                              <span>Amazon US is running a Lightning Deal today that&#x27;s worth knowing about: just $180 for a 27-in 1440p 144Hz gaming monitor from Innocn. This brand is one I&#x27;ve covered before - my colleague John Linneman was impressed with both a portable OLED and a 40-inch ultrawide from the Chinese company - so it&#x27;s definitely worth trying in my view.

                              <span>I am fond of Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a trilogy of cooking games which became increasingly ambitious until the third was about operating a food truck on a post-apocalyptic road trip.

Cook Serve Forever looks more ambitious again. It&#x27;s a new game from the same developers with similar combo-tapping food prep at its core, but set in a new solarpunk city. As of today, there&#x27;s a demo you can play and an early access release date set for April.

As a result, every Hitman 3 owner now has access to all the levels from Hitman 1 and 2, if they didn&#x27;t already.

Today they launched I Commissioned Some Bunnies, where once again they have commissioned artists to draw pictures with hidden animals to find. Still a big fan of that casual descriptive naming scheme. And yup, the pictures are nice, and the rabbits are hidden, and I&#x27;m happy to have spent £3 on it.

                              <span>Shoulders Of Giants is out today on the Epic Games Store. When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;, which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie&#x27;s treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: &quot;Wooooaaaah.&quot;
Consider the progress of information. It&#x27;s a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It&#x27;s mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.

                              <span>Snow leopards are my absolute favourite animals in the world. I would die happy if I ever got the chance to see one  in real life (from a great distance of course, lest it de-grundle me). Alas, the closest that most of us will get in our lives is to play Planet Zoo - easily the best zoo simulator out there right now.

                              <span>One dev who worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt had a good think about their most useless piece of video game knowledge in response to a Twitter stumper, but still came up with something interesting anyway. Patrick Mills was a quest designer on The Witcher 3 and senior quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077 for CD Projekt RED, and shared a neat bit of trivia about The Witcher 3’s wandering merchants on his own account this week. Mills revealed that the script for these lads would dish out fixes whatever stage you were at in the game.

                              <span>Well. They certainly remade Dead Space. With some small but welcome exceptions, Dead Space is a one-to-one remake of the 2008 original.


Your opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.

I hear it&#x27;s pretty good! It&#x27;s one of the small handful of games Microsoft have confirmed as coming to PC Game Pass in the next fortnight, which also include the JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure fighting game and a return to the subscription service for Darkest Dungeon. Alas, games coming mean games going. Do check out Donut County before it&#x27;s swallowed by the abyss.

                              <span>Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.
It’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you&#x27;ll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.

Naughty Dog’s co-president Neil Druckmann commented in a Buzzfeed interview that the company is “moving on” from the Uncharted series, and that they’re not feeling pressured into making The Last Of Us Part III.

                              <span>EA Motive’s Dead Space remake stalks onto PC tomorrow, nearly a decade and a half after the original made us collectively need to buy new pants. Earlier this week, I reported on the possibility of this new take on Dead Space getting an alternate ending.

Raven Software and Infinity Ward have shared details about how that’s going to work in a new blog post, along with some info about more changes to battle royale, DMZ, and Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer. The post doesn’t go over incoming maps, modes, and features that players can expect to see in Season 02, but the devs say they’ll be sharing more on those nearer to the new season’s kick-off time.

This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they’re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the element…</span>

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us this morning on Twitch at 10 a.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Chained Echoes deceives at first glance, making you question if you missed it back when its seeming contemporaries, like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, were making a big splash. Of course, the reality is this lavish and imaginative RPG is brand new, crafted mostly by a single developer as both an homage to and celebration of those old games, even while injecting a healthy dose of new concepts. The resulting adventure may look like something from 30 years ago, but it plays with a sophistication that deserves attention from any ge…</span>

                              <span>Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.
The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.


We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. 
Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</span>

The studio made lofty promises regarding the kind of experience it would be able to deliver with the new hardware, and during today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, we received more information on the next entry of the sim-racing franchise, simply called Forza Motorsport.
Turn 10 Studios calls this entry &quot;a generational leap ahead for the Forza Motorsport series.&quot; For the first time in series history, Forza Motorsport has fully dynamic time of day and weather, which impact how cars handle; track temperatures and surface conditions combine with the texture of the driving surface to ensure that each lap is distinct.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for mechanical keyboards, but I don&#x27;t discriminate against high-end membrane or scissor switch boards either. One of the best non-mechs I&#x27;ve tried over the last few years has been the Logitech MX Keys, which is available in a compact MX Keys Mini model or as the full-size MX Keys. Today, the full-size UK model is discounted on Amazon UK, where it&#x27;s down from £120 to £80 - a nice 33% or 40 quid off.

But there&#x27;s still plenty that&#x27;s familiar from traditional Minecraft, if tonight&#x27;s presentation during the Xbox developer showcase is any indication.

They also announced a release date: April 18th.

One that doesn&#x27;t feature on that list but has attracted strong reviews elsewhere is the Edifier R1280T, a 2.0 studio speaker set that delivers excellent sound for the money. These speakers are normally normally around £100, but today on Overclockers you can grab a pair for £84 - lower than they&#x27;ve ever been before.

                              <span>In June 2022, Bungie obtained a $13.5m copyright infringement judgment against defendants who supplied Destiny 2 cheating software &#x27;Wallhax&#x27;. New filings by Bungie claim that Wallhax logged users&#x27; machines, including medical data of Department of Defense or &quot;active military&quot; personnel. Meanwhile, two defendants are now testifying on behalf of Bungie.

ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support.

Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.
Yes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.
Please assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any bugs or problems during your gameplay, please file them on our issue tracker.
