                    <span>&quot;What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?&quot; This is the question we&#x27;ve been asked the most since Sony&#x27;s new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5&#x27;s power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t ranking them. If a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a mus…</span>

                    <span>Believes a Game Awards appearance is perhaps too soon.
Over the past few weeks, some Nintendo fans on social media have convinced themselves that one &quot;world premiere&quot; we&#x27;ll be getting at this year&#x27;s Game Awards is tied to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel.
It all stems from a tweet by the host and organiser Geoff Keighley - mentioning how &quot;honored&quot; he was to reveal a project that he&#x27;s been working on with a developer for 2.5 years. The &quot;hype&quot; has since snowballed, but before you get too excited, you might want to read on...

It&#x27;s the 30th anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog series this year, and there&#x27;s a rumour that Sega may go out with a bang at The Game Awards later this week.
According to a post over on Reddit, the following domain was recently registered - frontiers.sonicthehedgehog.com, and over on Steam the number of Sonic games has been updated from 34 to 35. It&#x27;s led to fan theories that we might perhaps see Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s new game at the annual awards show on December 9th. There&#x27;s also the possibility of Sonic Origins getting some time in the spotlight.

                    <span>Voice actor Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey has confirmed she will reprise her role as Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower in the sequel to 2020&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
O&#x27;Shaughnessey revealed the casting news on Twitter this afternoon saying, &quot;Taking my old pal Tails for another adventure. Thrilled to announce I’m the voice of Miles “Tails” Prower in #SonicMovie2! Can’t wait for y&#x27;all to see him on the big screen.&quot; 
Taking my old pal Tails for another adventure. Thrilled to announce I’m the voice of Miles “Tails” Prower in #SonicMovie2! Can’t wait for y&#x27;all to see him on the big screen.
December 7, 2021
She joins stars Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Jim Carrey (Dr. Ivo Robotnik), and James Marsden (Donut Lord... ahem. I mean Tom Wachowski), who will reprise their roles from the first film. Idris Elba is, of course voicing Knuckles the Echidna to round out the trio of animated characters we know of so far. O&#x27;Shaughnessey also played Tails in the brief stinger featured at the end 2020&#x27;s adaptation.
Colleen has been the voice of Tails for quite a few years, first stepping into the flying fox&#x27;s shoes since 2013 games Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystals. Prior to that, she was the voice of Knuckles Chaotix alum Charmy Bee before also taking on the role of Sonic&#x27;s stalwart partner.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is slated to hit theaters on April, 8 2022.
We&#x27;re coming up on the end of Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary, and while we know a new game is in the works, there&#x27;s not much info out about it. Since we&#x27;re in a standstill waiting on more about the title, check out Marcus Stewart&#x27;s wonderful piece about how Solar Ash is a great base for a new 3D Sonic game.</span>

                    <span>When The Last Night premiered during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 2017 presentation, its cyberpunk-flavored blend of 3D graphics and pixel art dazzled audiences. Unfortunately, developer Odd Tales has hit a lot of roadblocks since then, including losing its publishing partner and raising funding on its own. The Last Night has since occupied the “whatever happened to that game?” bingo card, but it appears Odd Tale is busy prepping to reintroduce the game in the foreseeable future. 
PC Gamer spoke with The Last Night’s creator, Tim Soret, via email last week regarding rumors that the game will appear during The Game Awards on December 9. Soret dismissed these rumors as just that, saying “...The Last Night will be shown next year, not before.&quot; He doesn’t commit to saying the game will launch in 2022, explaining that he wants to avoid putting pressure on his small team and that they’re carefully building The Last Night “brick by brick” to adapt the game’s visuals for current-gen as well as implementing a suite of accessibility options.
&quot;What we know is that for The Last Night comeback in 2022, we make it our mission to blow everyone away by the strength &amp; originality of our proposition.&quot; says Soret. You can watch the original debut trailer for a reminder of why people really want The Last Night to release.

The Last Night was originally intended to launch in 2018, but Odd Tales split from publisher Raw Fury. Although Odd Tales regained full publishing rights to the game, the divorce seemingly triggered an avalanche of funding and legal issues the team stated it couldn’t publically speak on. Odd Tales even said it had to cancel a trailer intended for the 2018 Game Awards. The Last Night has clearly been through the wringer, but it’s refreshing to hear that it may be climbing out of development hell sooner rather than later.
The Last Night is slated to launch on Xbox One and PC.

                    <span>Remember when we used to order pizza delivery inside EverQuest II? Final Fantasy XIV is teaming up with GrubHub to offer a new “Eat Pizza” emote for those that use Grubhub’s delivery service from December 9 to December 15. And with all that time you spend waiting in queue to play, you’re sure to work up a powerful appetite! The first 20,000 orders that redeem the code ENDWALKER at checkout not only get the emote, but they also get free delivery on the order (up to $6).
All participants get the Eat Pizza emote on December 17th, which can then be redeemed on a Final Fantasy XIV account. You could probably get a code and give it to a friend for the holidays or something, given how this works after you order food. Even though the emote is pizza-related, you can order anything (as long as the order is over $15) for the purposes of scoring the emote code. As you may be playing Final Fantasy XIV, I’d recommend something that won’t get your controller or mouse greasy. The emote itself is sure to be the height of fashion in all those new Endwalker dungeons and raids. You can check out the full promotion details here.
Have you been playing Endwalker? Are you trying out the Reaper or the Sage? Is a pizza emote an awesome addition to the cool actions you can do in-game, a sign of the apocalypse, or just something to do between feeding your Chocobo? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop four times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as the goofiest item yet: a flower to fasten to your Spartans helmet.
The biggest bundle this week is the Soldier Armor Set for the Mark VII. In the bundle, you will find the epic Tac/Liberty Rig, Tahuna Sands armor coating, sleek soldier helmet design, a variety of attachments including the Mithril visor, and last but not least, the Rocket Rescue stance. This set retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.
If you don&#x27;t want your Spartan to look overly serious, you can purchase the Daisy Delights bundle to add a small stuffed bear to the chest plate and a flower to the helmet. If you want to wear two flowers at once, you can swap out the bear for a yellow rose. This bundle is 1,500 credits.
And who doesn&#x27;t like pickles? The final bundle called Special Delivery offers a Space Pickle charm, a gold Legend visor (which looks a lot like Master Chief&#x27;s), and the Into the Breach stance. The final item offered this week is the Chibi Chieftain bundle, which adds cute decals of alien characters to your vehicles, nameplate, weapons, and armor.</span>

He&#x27;ll be available for free on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this week, with his addition to the Switch version coming later this month (also for free), according to IGN.

Garfield, known for taking naps and loving Italian food, is bringing a move list inspired by his comic strip and cartoons. The reveal trailer shows him donning a top hat and cane, scarfing lasagna, and going feral with some wild cat scratches. He&#x27;s also showing an appropriate amount of sass, which I appreciate. We&#x27;ll have to wait for the full character breakdown for his release this week to find out if he&#x27;s any good. Though, Garfield has to be at least ready for this type of game since he&#x27;s been edgeguarding Odie for 40 years.
I reviewed Nick Brawl in October, where I found it to be a solid yet flawed platform fighter. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the review: 
Garfield looks to be the first of two free characters coming to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, with another unknown combatant coming sometime in the future. Developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs are also planning paid DLC fighters down the road. 
Are you looking forward to taking control of Garfield and terrorizing the competition? Who is your favorite voice for the feline, and why is the rendition from Garfield and Friends? Tell us in the comments below!</span>

Nick Offerman has been cast as Bill in HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV series, which is an adaptation of the PlayStation-exclusive game of the same name.
Previously, it was revealed that Con O&#x27;Neill had been cast as Bill, leading to widespread circulation yesterday as for who Offerman might be playing (many thought he&#x27;d make a good Bill but the role was already cast). However, a new report from Variety reveals that Offerman will, in fact, play Bill in HBO&#x27;s series after O&#x27;Neill had to drop out from the show due to a scheduling conflict.

                    <span>Yesterday, employees at Raven Software staged a walk-out protesting last week&#x27;s surprise layoffs of a dozen of its QA department contractors. The terminations created an uproar within the Call of Duty support studio, as the firings affected a reported third of its entire QA team. Furthermore, several terminated employees had recently been hired and relocated to the studio’s Madison, Wisconsin office – in some instances, out of their own pockets. The protests continue today, and workers at other Activision Blizzard offices have joined in.
 It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is …</span>

                    <span>Playdead has seemingly released a new image from its third game in development, which goes by the name Game 3 as it does not yet have a formal title. 
Playdead is one of the most intriguing developers in games and in no small part due to the mystery around their games. It isn’t a very public studio, opting to tease out an image here or there rather than a full blog post with trailers and more like many others in the industry. And it’s seemingly not beholden to any kind of timelines...because the studio just releases games when it wants to, and it works – both Limbo and Inside reviewed really well, especially here at Game Informer. 
That mystique around Playdead remains with the studio&#x27;s third game in development. The latest look at Game 3 comes by way of a tweet advertising jobs available …</span>

                    <span>Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Event in Destiny 2 has begun and a new trailer released today showcases some of the loot inspired by the studio’s history that will be available in-game. 
When you think of Bungie, there’s a good chance either Destiny pops into your head or Halo, and rightfully so – it’s the two properties the studio is best known for creating. Bungie split from Microsoft back in 2007 to become independent, something Xbox head Phil Spencer doesn’t think would have happened in today’s Xbox ecosystem, and after over half a decade, it released Destiny.
A sequel was released in 2017, aptly titled Destiny 2, and that’s the studio’s main bread and butter at this point.

                    <span>Ubisoft has announced its first step into bringing NFTs and blockchain technology into its games with the beta release of the Ubisoft Quartz platform. Starting on December 9, 12, and 15, Ghost Recon Breakpoint for PC will receive the first round of Digits, Ubisoft&#x27;s name for playable, in-game NFTs.
Quartz is a mobile app that will facilitate the connection between the goods in your digital wallets and Ubisoft&#x27;s games that will use the NFT cosmetics called Digits. It&#x27;s considered a test of the technology right now, but eventually, Ubisoft&#x27;s goal is to have these Digits move from game to game, allowing players to use and show off their unique gear outside of Breakpoint.

                    <span>Spiritfarer is getting the final batch of content from its 2021 roadmap, and developer Thunder Lotus bills it as the most significant addition yet. Jackie and Daria are two new spirits joining the fray alongside an uncharted island to explore and a new event. 
The free update arrives on December 13 for all versions of the game. The story sees Stella visit a rundown hospital situated on an unknown island. She meets Jackie, a caretaker and spirit in the form of a hyena, and Daria, a bat and Jackie’s patient. By befriending these two lovable spirits, you’ll help them get the hospital up and running again. As seen in the trailer below, the update adds a new platforming-focused event, and you outfit your ferry with new upgrades.

As previously noted, the Jackie &amp; Daria update will be the game’s last. Two previous add-ons introduced two other spirits, Lily and Beverly, and their respective stories. Now that Spiritfaer is wrapped up, we look forward to seeing what Thunder Lotus has up its sleeve next. 
Spiritfarer is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. You can read our review here to find out why it’s a gem you shouldn’t overlook.</span>

                    <span>You should really savor and enjoy the campaign missions you play in Halo Infinite when 343 Industries’ latest sci-fi shooter goes live tomorrow because it’ll be the only time you can play them on that save file. 
That’s because you won’t be able to replay campaign story missions in Halo Infinite on a save file where you’ve already played said campaign story missions. In order to replay campaign missions, you’ll need to start a fresh save. This might be frustrating for completionists as the campaign missions feature collectibles that are easy to miss. If you miss one, you won’t be able to go back and get it after you beat the mission. However, 343 Industries told The Verge that it’s looking to change that.

“We haven’t announced a date but that is being worked on,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker told The Verge. “We want to have replay that works well, and when you have a more open game, it gets a lot trickier. So we made a decision to improve the quality of the single-player campaign to ensure that, as a foundation, that it’s as strong as it possibly could be so that we could then add the other features back in.” 
If you’re looking to 100% Halo Infinite and unlock all of the campaign-related achievements in your first playthrough, it sounds like you might want to keep a guide handy just in case.

                    <span>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection was announced back in September and at the time, PlayStation said it would launch sometime in early 2022. Now, we have an official release date. 
This collection, which bundles together remastered versions of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy for PlayStation 5, will launch on January 28, according to a new PlayStation Blog post. The collection is also coming to PC but PlayStation said more details about the release date for that version will come at a later date. To celebrate news of the collection’s release date, PlayStation has released a new trailer showcasing some of the new and beautiful visuals coming to Lost Legacy and A Thief’s End.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s growth doesn’t seem to be slowing down as more people are actively registered to play it than ever before. 
What started as a failure, causing the team at Square Enix to completely revamp and relaunch the game, has grown to become one of the most successful MMOs on the market. Final Fantasy XIV’s growth has led to 25 million registered players, up from 24 million back in October, as reported by Eurogamer.

This number could rise even more today as the latest expansion, Endwalker, is finally out after launching into early access last week. Hopefully, those players have been paying attention to the information the team behind Final Fantasy XIV has been releasing because the MMO’s servers are currently congested, with some players hitting queue lines as long as 5000-plus players. 
The team is giving all registered players and those who own Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for all of the server congestion. The onset of Endwalker has also led to Final Fantasy XIV garnering its largest concurrent player base ever. As noted by Eurogamer, the peak concurrent for the MMO hit an all-time high two days ago, reaching 95,000 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. The previous record happened in July, and it was nearly 30,000 less at 67,000. With Endwalker’s launch happening today, we wouldn’t be surprised if a new concurrent record is reached (assuming the servers can keep up). 
While waiting to queue into Endwalker, check out Game Informer’s Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker New Gameplay Today, and then check out this new trailer for the expansion. Read about how the team is still working to bring Final Fantasy XIV to Xbox after that.

Eurogamer noted the release times for Halo Infinite’s launch tomorrow, and due to the global launch nature, the latest sci-fi shooter from 343 Industries will launch early in the day in some places and much later in the day in others. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect: 
West Coast: 10 a.m. PST
Central: Noon CT

Just when I thought I&#x27;d seen everything Star Wars had to offer, Zynga introduces one of the strangest ideas yet: a Jawa standing on his brother&#x27;s shoulders to create a tall fighter named Utooni. This puzzling creation is just one of the many combatants in Zynga&#x27;s Star Wars: Hunters, a Switch and mobile game that is slated to release next year.
Star Wars: Hunters is a free-to-play multiplayer game that takes some real chances with its roster. You won&#x27;t see recognizable characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, or Boba Fett battling to the death. Zynga is instead making its own lineup of warriors from the Outer Rim. Another odd one is named Slingshot, which just happens to be a droideka piloted by an Ugnaught. There&#x27;s also a droid named J-3DI, which t…</span>

Nintendo&#x27;s been ramping up the adverts in preparation for the Christmas rush, but what about the post-Christmas &quot;oh no, I ate too many mince pies&quot; slim-down? Well, we have Ring Fit Adventure, of course, which is available again after that early pandemic rush.
But the advert for &quot;Buy Ring Fit To Work Off Those Christmas Calories&quot; isn&#x27;t filmed yet. Casting agency Kate And Lou + Ro Casting is currently looking for &quot;people who enjoy incorporating Ring Fit into their at home exercise routine, and from families who enjoy playing and exercising together using Ring Fit&quot; to film an advert at their own house.

It&#x27;s been a month since Animal Crossing: New Horizons got that stonking big update, plus the double stonking Happy Home Paradise DLC that none of us could have predicted. When the game first came out, albeit in much weirder pandemic-beginning-times than the update, most of us were guzzling it up for at least the first month or two — so what happened this time?
We smushed together Zion from the video team and Kate from the writing team to discuss their thoughts, feelings, and discoveries made while playing the update and the DLC. Also, because both of them are very chatty and easily distracted, they also discuss hats, chocolate, and secret toilets.

There are a lot of 2D &#x27;Metroidvanias&#x27; kicking around, but there&#x27;s a reason for that - they&#x27;re often enjoyable and the better entries in the genre can be top-notch experiences. Another that&#x27;s heading to Switch in late 2022 is Afterimage, which is the work of developer Aurogon Shanghai.
It has some extremely handsome hand-drawn visuals, with the hope being that it&#x27;ll optimise well for Nintendo&#x27;s system - we do have some gorgeous 2D titles on the Switch already. The concept and setting look rather promising, and you can see some of the official details and screens below.

Three years ago today, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched worldwide on Nintendo Switch. And what a game it turned out to be, huh?
With its constant character reveals, Nintendo Direct showcases, and internet memes aplenty, few games have had quite the impact on the gaming community that Ultimate has in recent times. While the game itself is brilliant fun, and objectively an impressive piece of work from a development and licensing point of view, we can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s everything surrounding the game – all of the hype, rumours, &quot;leaks&quot;, and discussion – that will really help Ultimate to stand out in the years to come.

After diving deep into the new Minecraft Caves and Cliffs Part II update (all the way down to Y-64), our resident Minecraft expert Kate Gray is ready to declare her verdict on the whole thing. Do new caves and cliffs make that much of a difference to a game that&#x27;s all about caves and cliffs? Read on to find out...

There&#x27;s an interesting phenomenon that I&#x27;ve observed with Minecraft. I keep dragging my friends into the game to build little towns with me, and every time, they can&#x27;t help remarking that &quot;things have changed so much&quot; since they last played. Everyone seems to have had a Minecraft phase, and that phase was often a few years back — before the Nether was added, or before axolotls — so, when they come to the game in 2021, everything is glorious, new, and incredibly confusing.

It seems that the Switch version will feature some bonus content not currently available in the PS4 version, too. As noted by RPG Site, Atlus has announced that each of the titular sentinels will get two new armaments each in the Switch version — 26 in all.

The Nintendo Switch Online free trials have served up a nice mix of Indie gems and occasionally some major retail titles. The next arrival in Europe is certainly in the first category, but could be an excellent option for some pre-Holiday unwinding.
Shin&#x27;en Multimedia&#x27;s Art of Balance will be available to EU subscribers from 14th December to 20th December. As a reminder it&#x27;s the latest and greatest version of a WiiWare gem, but with HD visuals, 200 levels and an impressive variety of modes.

                    <span>&quot;There’s kind of something for everyone&quot;.
If there&#x27;s one aspect of Switch which has allowed players to truly make the console their own, it&#x27;s the ability to chop-and-change the Joy-Con which ship with the system. Many different colour combinations are available thanks to the various packs Nintendo sells, and the company has even gotten into the realm of offering series-specific controllers for the likes of Zelda and Super Mario.
However, there&#x27;s always that desire to make your console feel even more personal, and that&#x27;s where GameTraderZero.com comes in. Founded by Gal Silver, the store offers customised Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, some of which boast special mods such as D-pads and LED lighting. Keen to know a little more about this burgeoning business, we sat down with Silver for a little chat.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a workaround for competitive matches.
Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are off to a pretty cracking start, lighting up the official charts and sparking some particularly noteworthy moments within the gaming community. As popular as they seem to be, though, one feature typically present in new-generation releases is being sorely missed.
You see, just like fellow remakes Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!, the new Diamond and Pearl games don&#x27;t offer an online matchmaking system. Online battles are possible through the game&#x27;s Union Room by sharing codes or playing with friends, but for players who like to effortlessly jump into competitive-style matches, playing by their own custom rulesets, the possibilities aren&#x27;t nearly as straightforward as they could be.

                    <span>With a rhyming villain bunny-thing.
MONARK is an intriguing RPG that arrives in February, getting attention initially for having a team including a number of former Shin Megami Tensei developers. It now has a flashy new trailer to showcase its combat along with a darn good tune (above).
We&#x27;ll be honest and say that, as entertaining as the video is, it&#x27;s not exactly a useful overview of the actual combat. The official website&#x27;s blurb is below for a little more context:

                    <span>WinBack, baby WinBack, that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at.
It’d be easy to dismiss Winback without a second thought. Developed by Omega Force — nowadays famous for the long-running Dynasty Warriors series and associated Musou spin-offs/crossovers — and released for N64 back in 1999, it’s probably the least well-known of the Switch Online service’s initial Nintendo 64 offerings; a title that falls under the unflattering banner of being a perceived ripping-off of the venerable Metal Gear Solid. This, however, is inaccurate. There’s a compelling argument that Winback, for all its flaws, is one of the more prominently influential N64 titles, with measurable influence on some of the biggest games of all time.
That’s not contrarian gum-flapping, you know. This third-person shooter brings in some innovations that became full-on conventions, and it doesn’t really get the appropriate credit for them. Its cover system, which sees you tap &#x27;A&#x27; to get in position behind a wall or a crate or any such scenery, then peer out to take pot-shots? Pure Gears of War. You’ve also got the laser-sight for free aiming, which returned in spectacular style with – most prominently – Resident Evil 4.

                    <span>The eShop&#x27;s biggest games.
Nintendo has shared an updated list of Europe&#x27;s most-downloaded Switch eShop games, revealing which titles were the most popular during November 2021.
It&#x27;s perhaps no surprise to see that the new Pokémon games have done the business this month, with both Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl claiming first and second spots respectively. Mario Party Superstars isn&#x27;t far behind in third, and the rest of the list is made up of familiar favourites and indie hits.

Remember Gary Bowser? He shares his name with Mario&#x27;s greatest foe (and Nintendo of America&#x27;s current president), but he&#x27;s been something of an enemy of Nintendo in general over the past few years.
Bowser is a member of Team Xecutor, one of the world&#x27;s most &quot;notorious videogame piracy groups&quot; which has become infamous for creating tools that exploit vulnerabilities in Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft video game hardware. The tools in question allow end-users to overcome protective measures put in place by hardware makers in order to run unofficial software, with game piracy being one of the most notable uses.

Nintendo&#x27;s Game Builder Garage might not have taken off quite as much as the company would have hoped, but talented players are still busy creating some wonderful little games using the software&#x27;s tech.
A prime example of this, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, is Metroid Attack!, a game created by the folks behind YouTube channel, Looygi Bros. It&#x27;s a shooting gallery minigame that tasks the player with blasting 50 Metroids; the fiendish enemies come flying at you in waves, and thanks to some clever programming, the wave patterns won&#x27;t always be the same.

It is now nine years old, and so of course it&#x27;s received a 9th anniversary update. It has been &quot;updated for modern operating systems&quot;, with menu, HUD and UI fixes, and Mac and Linux ports. Lovely.

Yeah, thirst for those bunnyboys will only make the queues longer.

Sadly, at least at launch, you can’t do any of that…

                    <span>So you got your hands on an Xbox Series X? Congratulations! As you&#x27;ve probably noticed by now, the hardware allows for lightning fast gaming when compared to previous generations, and the Quick Resume feature that allows you to seamlessly change games is, well, a game-changer. While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.
The team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S. As more games come out, we&#x27;ll update this list with the latest releases that we feel deserve to crack the top 10.

                    <span>Solar Ash is a great game that cherry-picks ideas from Jet Set Radio, Shadow of the Colossus, and Super Mario Galaxy. However, only one series came to mind as I skated across its teal clouds: Sonic the Hedgehog. More specifically, the 3D entries, which are the oft-maligned titles responsible for decades of headaches for the Blue Blur. 
I’ll admit that I’m a Sonic traditionalist. My love of Sonic, like many other 30-somethings, began on the Sega Genesis, so I firmly believe the character is at his best in 2D. Sonic 2 is my favorite in the series and Sonic Mania, the 2017 throwback developed by a team of fans rather than Sonic Team proper, is the best entry in years. 
The 3D installments have never gotten Sonic right. Yes, even the Adventure series, which I respect but still maintain are bad…</span>

                    <span>The first game from Embark Studios, a veteran team led by former EA and Dice head Patrick Söderlund, is set to be revealed this week. The game is called Arc Raiders, and we got a glimpse of what to expect in a cryptic teaser video.
The video is one of those “trailer for the trailer” as it states a full reveal is slated for Thursday, December 9. Hey, that’s the same day as The Game Awards — what a funny coincidence. The video shows some third-person shooting, a woman calling for volunteers, and an “Enlist. Resist” tagline. You can watch the teaser in the tweet below.

December 6, 2021
We first caught wind of Embark’s new game last November, when the studio began hiring for a PvP team-based shooter and shared concept art of the project. It seems safe to assume that Arc Raiders is this project, but we’ll find out for sure soon enough. Embark was formed in 2018 after Söderlund departed EA earlier that same year. The team is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and boasts roughly 200 employees as of November 2020. The company’s mission statement, according to its website, is “to blur the line between playing and making,” and many of the posts have centered on showcasing development tools.
What do you think about this first tease for Arc Raiders? Any guesses as to what kind of game it could be? Share your thoughts in the comments!</span>

                    <span>With the world&#x27;s return to The Matrix franchise a couple of weeks away (the time it would take to download a movie on Limewire in the early 2000s), Epic Games is releasing a new experience built on its new engine. Partnering with the cast and crew from the upcoming film, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will show off what the new software can do.

The Matrix Resurrections director Lana Wachowski is involved in bringing this tech showcase to life, and so are the film&#x27;s stars, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who provide performances for Awakens. The trailer for the Unreal experience is exceptionally short, only providing a couple of seconds of Reeves doing what&#x27;s demanded of him in a bright white void: questioning existence, asking, &quot;How do we know what is real,&quot; which is a question that&#x27;s probably pointed at his own physical being in the trailer, a near-lifelike recreation of the well-known actor. Or else he&#x27;s messing with us, and that is actually Keanu on film. To that, I say, kudos for making me question three seconds of footage all day.
The Matrix Awakens is available now to pre-load on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stay tuned for more info on the experience at The Game Awards this Thursday.

                    <span>A senior executive at Sony was fired after being caught in an alleged pedophile sting video posted online. 
George Cacioppo was a senior vice president of engineering for Sony for over eight years, having worked on products such as the PlayStation Store and more. Over the weekend, the amateur pedophile-busting YouTube channel People v. Preds posted a video online that accused him of trying to meet with a 15-year-old boy. After the video began to pick up steam, Sony told CNET that Cacioppo had been fired. 
“We are aware of the situation and the employee in question has been terminated from employment,” Sony told CNET in a statement on Sunday. 
CNET attempted to contact Cacioppo via his LinkedIn profile but did not receive a comment. At the time of this writing, the former vice president of engineering has not publicly commented on the video or his subsequent termination from Sony. 
People v. Preds told Kotaku that its videos are posted online publicly rather than turned into police for an official investigation, because “the police department doesn’t work with ‘Cyber groups’ like us,” and that “that’s when the internet takes over.” However, People v. Preds also told Kotaku that “evidence has been turned into the authorities.” 
The video, which is still publicly available for viewing, shows Cacioppo in a PlayStation 5 shirt being accused by People v. Preds of trying to meet with a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. CNET says Cacioppo told the 15-year-old that his name was “Jeff” and that “Jeff” gave the teen an address for the two to meet and have sex. 
The San Diego Police Department has received People v. Preds’ evidence, but police have released no public information regarding this incident. It’s still unclear if this will developer into a case, but regardless, Cacioppo is no longer a Sony employee.

                    <span>Spider-Man: No Way Home premieres in theaters this month. If you’ve kept up with any marketing or merchandise, you already know that Peter Parker will rock a pair of new suits in the film. And when new Spidey costumes swing in, Insomniac is right there to put them into its game, Marvel’s Spider-Man, as quickly as possible. 
On December 10, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is getting the &quot;Black &amp; Gold&quot; suit (yes, that’s its official name, according to Marvel) and the Iron Spider-like “Integrated Suit” that seemingly has ties to Doctor Strange. Once again, these suits are only coming to the Remastered edition, the PlayStation 5 version of the 2018 game that is only available as part of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. You can catch some quick looks at the suits in the trailer below.

While not surprising to see, new costumes are always cool and this expands Marvel’s Spider-Man roster of movie suits. It already has Tom Holland’s suits from Spider-Man: Homecoming, Far From Home, and Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, as well as the costumes worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in their respective film series. 
Spider-Man: No Way Home hits theaters on December 17. You can watch the latest trailer here.

                    <span>The Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a Daredevil and fans of the character will likely recognize the actor behind the mask. 
That’s because the performer is Charlie Cox, who portrayed the hero across three seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil series, which is technically canon to the MCU. Marvel boss Kevin Feige finally announced the news, long-rumored to be in the works, in an interview with CinemaBlend and in it, he revealed that while Cox’s casting has been announced, where we’ll first see him remains a secret. 
“If you were to see Daredevil in upcoming things, Charlie Cox, yes, would be the actor playing Daredevil,” Feige said. “Where we see that, how we see that, when we see that, remains to be seen.” 
Fans have long speculated that Cox would be returning to the role in the MCU, with some hoping he makes a more lawyer-related appearance in Marvel and Sony’s upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter Parker is in need of a lawyer, after all, considering he’s been accused of killing Quentin Beck aka Mysterio). Perhaps that’s what Feige is alluding to – it’s also possible that the MCU hasn’t quite figured out Daredevil’s first outing, meaning Feige wouldn’t have much to say on Cox’s role in the universe just yet. 
Only time will tell, but for those who have watched Daredevil, today’s news is sure to be welcome. Daredevil is largely viewed as Netflix’s best Marvel series, in no small part due to Cox’s role as the vigilante. If you haven’t yet seen Cox as Daredevil, the entire Netflix series is worth watching. Plus, some have speculated that Kingpin, the villain throughout the Daredevil series, might be making an appearance in Marvel’s ongoing Disney+ show, Hawkeye.

                    <span>Xbox head Phil Spencer has revealed that he believes today’s Microsoft could have kept Bungie around. 
This news comes by way of Axios, which reports that Spencer understands why Bungie left Microsoft to become independent in a new interview. He also said that in today’s Xbox ecosystem, Bungie might have stayed with Microsoft. 
“Could we [keep Bungie around] today? I think we could,” Spencer told Axios when asked if Bungie’s departure was inevitable. 
Spencer said that since Bungie’s departure, Xbox has learned a lot but understands why the studio left. 
“At the time, they had big ambitions,” Spencer said. “They had sold their business for a certain amount of money. They saw what Halo turned into. And it’s like, ‘Okay, Microsoft benefited more than Bungie did from the success of Halo.’ There’s no other story that can be written there.” 
Spencer continued and said he understands the appeal of becoming independent, citing that Bungie probably felt like it had another Halo-like franchise in them. 
“If you’re saying, ‘Hey, I think I’ve got another one of those in me. I want to really take another chance,’ I can understand the allure of doing that as an independent company,” the Xbox head said.
Bungie formally split from Microsoft, with whom it had made multiple Halo games, in 2007. On October 5 of that year, Bungie announced the split and said it had become an independent company. In the division, though, Microsoft retained all rights to Halo, a franchise now developed primarily by 343 Industries.
Nearly three years later, Bungie signed onto a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, with which its popular Destiny franchise would begin. In January of 2019, the studio announced that it had ended this publishing deal early, meaning Bungie was independent once more. It seems that Bungie intends to retain its independence for now.

He also revealed that the team will give all active players and owners of Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for the current queue times and congestion. This news comes after the early access release of Endwalker, which has seen players waiting hours to queue into the game. Many find themselves in the thousands in terms of their spot in queue lines, meaning there’s a large number of people that players must wait in line behind before they’re able to enter the MMO.

“Speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore, we want to let you all know that we’re still hard at work on building the next single-player focused experience for Dragon Age,” the blog post reads. “We’re excited for next year when we can talk more about what we’re working on.”
However, the blog post continues and says that BioWare has released two new short stories from the world of Dragon Age for fans to read in the meantime. Elsewhere in the blog post, the team thanked its fans for their continued support and discussed plans for Dragon Age Day, which includes new merch, a charity auction, and more. Check out the full blog post for more information about all of that. 
For more about Dragon Age 4, check out the trailer shown during The Game Awards 2020 and then take a look at this new Dragon Age 4 concept art revealed earlier this year. Read about how BioWare has confirmed that Dragon Age 4 is set in Tevinter after that.

With each explosive cannon blast, the outer sentries prove they’re not much of a threat, but my foes have prepared for this approach, and the narrow mountain path hits a blockade. While my marines disembark and charge ahead, I grapple up into the nearby hills and begin to pick off Jackals with a unique variant sniper rifle – spoils of an earlier conquest. But no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and I’m eventually scaling the outer fort wall and dr…</span>

Well, now there&#x27;s even more Titan Quest. The Eternal Embers expansion is out now, with Asian-inspired locations and loads of new things to hack and slash.

So as you venture through procedural levels, slashing at inky monsters, you&#x27;re also solving shape-shifting puzzles and using their movement to confuse and avoid enemies.

Now it has a demo up on Steam.

When the first few dilemmas you face in an RPG aren&#x27;t ethical or character ones, but about whether it would be more tedious to continue with this character or to play through the introduction again, you know there&#x27;s a problem. By my third restart I&#x27;d abandoned all interest in playing any character I wanted, and started trying to estimate whatever would get this over with sooner. Mechajammer is a disaster. And not only because of the bugs.

You don&#x27;t want to be cramping up your fingers trying to grip a mouse that&#x27;s too small or big, or struggling with a shape that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t designed for your dominant hand. The feel of a mouse is as important as the fit, too. You&#x27;re obviously going to be touching it a lot, so you want something with a comfortable texture and a click that feels right beneath your precious little fingers.

                    <span>The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I&#x27;ve been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.
I was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: &quot;Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.&quot; This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn&#x27;t not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.

                    <span>It&#x27;s easy to underestimate the nuances of buying a new keyboard, but it isn&#x27;t as simple as finding one that&#x27;s got all 26 letters on it. Whether you want lightning fast keystrokes to get the edge in multiplayer gaming, a fantastic-feeling keypress for a more tactile experience, or an RGB lightshow that makes your desk look like it&#x27;s hosting a tiny rock concert, there&#x27;s are many different factors to consider when investing in a new letter-rectangle.

                    <span>Even before the official launch of Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s Endwalker expansion on Tuesday, the MMORPG&#x27;s servers have been overloaded during its early access period for pre-orderers, leaving players in long queues to join. Oh, the perils of popularity! Sharing a status update over the weekend, game director Naoki Yoshida apologised again for the problems, and said they plan to give all active subscribers seven days of free game time.

The game&#x27;s island flipped over too, revealing a whole new map for players to explore in Chapter 3 Season 1. And I find myself being lured in by two new features I usually adore in games: sliding on your knees while shooting, and swinging around like Spider-Man.

                    <span>Since 2018, Dragon Age fans have celebrated an unofficial Dragon Age Day on December 4th, highlighting all sorts of community work and events. This year, BioWare got involved too, releasing new short stories and hosting charity streams. They also took the opportunity to remind fans that Dragon Age 4 is still on the way, confirming that it&#x27;ll be singleplayer. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up for Game Awards news though, because it sounds like we won&#x27;t hear any more about it until 2022.

                    <span>The breakout novelty simulator this year for me is Powerwash Simulator, a game about methodically moving your mouse over the surface of objects to blast away grime and rust with a murderously strong stream of water. It&#x27;s not a chaotic system like Viscera Cleanup Detail, it&#x27;s just a game where you slowly make something dirty all sparkling clean. Very chill. Now you can unwind with your pals and clean cars, toilets, fairground rides, and the rest together, thanks to the online co-op added in a recent update.

                    <span>Driving around with three snipers in the back of your jeep is overkill. But the shiny soldier boy of the Halo games has never cared less. This is the prime indulgence of Halo Infinite, the latest of the venerable sci-fi shootybangs. Sweet moments where it&#x27;s just you, an open country of undulating hillsides, and a truck full of trigger-happy marines. The developers have taken the eponymous second level of the first Halo, in which the big tin fella had to drive about helping his marooned space crew, and they&#x27;ve used it as a mood board for an entire game. Aside from a few gripes, it has worked splendidly.

                    <span>Fortnite changes faster and more dynamically than any other ongoing game. Yesterday&#x27;s epic finale to the two-year-long Chapter 2 event was again met with a radical shakeup to Fortnite&#x27;s core gameplay formula. For the start of Chapter 3 – which begins today – developer Epic Games introduces a new gameplay movement through a character who knows it better than anyone.
Spider-Man is joining the Battle Royale, and he&#x27;s bringing his web-swinging techniques with him. Players can play as the Wall Crawler in three suits: his classic red and blue comic-book look, the white Future Foundation suit, or his symbiotic black alternate. One of the new locations on the redesigned map is the Daily Bugle, a tall building that should hold a few Spider-Man easter eggs for fans.

Update 12/4/21 4:00 p.m. Central: *SPOILERS AHEAD* Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 2 finale titled &quot;The End&quot; has come and passed. Watch the video above to see the exciting climax featuring Jonesy and The Foundation. The island as we all know it has changed forever. Well, it&#x27;s still there, just flipped or rotated. In the meantime, we&#x27;re stranded in the ocean, left to await whatever adventures lie on the newly-inverted landmass, and what role The Foundation (now double confirmed to be Dwayne Johnson!) will play moving forward.
Original Story: Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.

What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week, we&#x27;re tackling the franchise&#x27;s most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. 
Released for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We&#x27;ll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M&#x27;s blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M. Is it as lousy as history has led us to believe? Tune in to get our takes.

                    <span>Added to the in-development Linux 5.16 kernel was cluster-aware scheduling designed to enhance system performance where groups of CPU cores may share caches or similar and thus the scheduler could benefit from knowing that information for making more optimal task placement. But as I pointed out early on with Linux 5.16, this cluster scheduling is hurting the Intel Alder Lake performance on the new kernel. Intel is now working to correct this by making the cluster scheduling configurable and disabling this functionality by default for hybrid CPUs  such as Alder Lake...</span>

Hot Wheels Unleashed&#x27;s Batman expansion, featuring a handful of cars and a Batcave? To me, meaningless licensed tie-in. But my kid... My kid must never know this exists.

                    <span>It feels at times as if, over a long enough timeline, all first-person shooters trend towards becoming the same game by cribbing modes from one another. Case in point: Quake now has a horde mode. It comes as part of a new update for Quake Remastered, Bethesda&#x27;s recent spit-and-polish of the classic 3D shooter. The horde mode is made by MachineGames for 1-4 players - and the update also includes a new (or &quot;new&quot;) singleplayer add-on.

When I do decide to head down Mexico way, I&#x27;ll get a better experience for having waited. Playground Games&#x27; second patch for the game went live this week, bringing tons of fixes.

Next up: a bundle of 66 games on Itch.io. Are you big hard-drived enough to let A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build, Old Man&#x27;s Journey, Lieve Oma, A Normal Lost Phone, Secrets Of Raetikon, Cosmic Express, Fugl, Botanicula, Hacknet, The Stillness Of The Wind, The Hex - *deep breath* - Art Sqool, Hidden Folks, Cloud Gardens, Signs Of The Sojourner, Wide Ocean Big Jacket, Coffee Talk, Ynglet and many more onto your computer?

Go on, have a heart. It&#x27;ll cost $5 and 100% of the money goes to the World Land Trust.

They&#x27;re now sending out a new wave of dev kits to creators, and as part of that they&#x27;re also testing their final packaging. That includes the neat-looking case pictured above.

                    <span>After playing around with cards and mechanics exclusive to Magic: The Gathering Arena, Wizards of the Coast is expanding into supporting a new digital-only format called Alchemy. This new format and everything that comes with it will launch on December 9. 
Alchemy is built on the Standard format and its yearly rotation of sets. That means when the time comes for a year&#x27;s worth of cards to drop out of Standard, they will lose legality in Alchemy as well. However, a pool of new, Arena exclusive cards will be added a few weeks after each Standard-legal set launches, meaning we&#x27;ll see new batches of digital cards every few months. Players will find these via Alchemy booster packs or by cashing in wildcards like any other card in Arena. Our first Alchemy infusion will play off of the most recen…</span>

                    <span>343 Industries is preparing for the launch of the Halo Infinite campaign next week, but it’s also kept multiplayer feedback and improvements as one of its top priorities. 
The team recently updated its multiplayer progression system to give players increased XP for the first six matches of any given day in response to calls from the community for battle pass progression to be sped up. Another popular ask from the community involves playlists, or specifically, the lack of dedicated free-for-all and SWAT playlists, amongst others such as a Slayer playlist.

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>Sony is reportedly working on an Xbox Game Pass competitor that will include three tiers of service and essentially see PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now merge. 
This news comes by way of a new Bloomberg report that says the service will be subscription-based, much like Sony&#x27;s current Plus and Now offerings and of course, Xbox Game Pass. The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games.

The subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. 
Bloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. 
While waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup.

                    <span>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, the Naughty Dog-developed platformer that spawned two sequels and multiple spinoffs, is now 20 years old, and to celebrate the anniversary, Sony has rounded up some retrospective thoughts from Naughty Dog devs and other PlayStation studio leads. 
Hitting PlayStation 2 on December 3, 2001, The Precursor Legacy is officially 20 years old, and as noted by Sony Interactive Entertainment content communications manager, Tim Turi, who wrote today’s PlayStation Blog post, it marks an interesting point for Naughty Dog. Today, Naughty Dog is best known for Uncharted and The Last of Us, but before those two franchises, their bread and butter was Jak and Daxter, the series the studio developed after its bout of Crash Bandicoot games.

This news comes by way of Eurogamer, which reports that Hazelight has indeed abandoned its trademark for “It Takes Two,” but remains hopeful as a studio that a resolution will be reached. The publication’s report indicates that Take-Two filed a trademark claim against Hazelight shortly after It Takes Two was released. Records show that Hazelight then abandoned ownership of the name.

                    <span>Developer One-O-One Games and Meta Publishing have pulled the curtain back on Aftermath, a new survival horror game coming next year. Players control an astronaut who returns to Earth after a mission only to find the planet upended by an alien invasion.
After a botched reentry to Earth, protagonist Charlie Gray finds herself alone, emotionally broken, but driven by a singular mission to locate her missing daughter. She’s up against an intimidating extraterrestrial menace, specifically an invisible hunter tracking her every move. Charlie must outwit this foe to survive while also confronting more in-your-face threats such as shambling corpse-like creatures in over-the-shoulder third-person combat. Charlie may not be a soldier, but she is a brilliant engineer, using those skills to concoct blueprints for tools by examining everyday objects. Think of her like a McGyver. As a survival game, managing Charlie’s nutrition, hydration, and mental health are vital.

Aftermath’s foreboding presentation and atmosphere come courtesy of artist Alessandro Bavari, art designer for Alien: Covenant. The soundtrack boasts original tracks from artists such as Unkle, Planet Funk, and others. 
If Aftermath piques your interest, keep an eye out when it launches in 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

                    <span>A handful of supposed Battlefield 2042 leaks appeared on social media yesterday and, due to their winter holiday theming, some fans were upset. 
New skins are likely a welcome addition to the online FPS, but some fans on the official Battlefield 2042 subreddit voiced their concern that a “Father Winter” skin for one of the specialists was a step too far – fans fear these skins indicate that 2042 will head in the route of Call of Duty: Warzone, which includes skins from Saw, Donnie Darko, and other less-serious cosmetics. The concern amongst fans is that 2042 is a more serious shooter compared to Warzone where skins similar to “Father Winter” might appear. You can see some of the supposed leaked skins below, courtesy of Battlefield Bulletin on Twitter.

Revealed on Twitter, the company released a trailer for the Nintendo 64 game, sharing that it will join the Switch’s online games service next week on December 10. However, because it’s an N64 game, not all Online users will have access to it as you must be subscribed to the Expansion Pack version of the service to play it.

In a forum post, Endwalker&#x27;s developers say that the game&#x27;s surge in popularity over the past year means that they&#x27;re expecting &quot;a number of logins that is yet to be seen since the launch of FFXIV,&quot; but that the global semiconductor shortage means they can&#x27;t fix the issue.

The cinematic pixel art platformer has been quiet almost ever since, but rumours began circling this week that it would resurface at the Game Awards later this month. Not so, says Soret. &quot;It will be shown next year, not before,&quot; he told PC Gamer.

It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. 


  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game&#x27;s multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.

                    <span>I hate to caveat a recommendation with “it gets good later” but unfortunately, the first hour of Chorus (despite the title stylisation, promotional materials do not write it out as Chorvs, cowards) is not good. Yet beyond that lacklustre start is a surprisingly tight arcade space fighter wrapped up in a wonderful bundle of pompous space magic.

                    <span>Pharaoh was one of those citybuilders I never really grasped how to play as a child, but hot damn if I didn&#x27;t spend hour after hour constructing neat little rows of farms and carving out a warren of roads for my citizens to scuttle about in. It&#x27;s a game I have very fond memories of, and publisher Dotemu&#x27;s latest dev diary about the soundtrack for the upcoming remake has cast me right back to those glorious, if rather futile afternoons spent staring at my parent&#x27;s living room computer. Musician Louis Godart is recreating the original game&#x27;s music from scratch for Pharaoh: A New Era, but he&#x27;s also adding some authentic touches of his own to help do those classic tunes justice.

                    <span>If you weren’t satisfied with only three DLC packs to play with in the hybrid metroidvania roguelike Dead Cells, don’t worry. The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.
The Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It&#x27;s described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.

                    <span>Neon Giant&#x27;s first DLC update for The Ascent is out now. They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.


That&#x27;s pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. 


The patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.

                    <span>When Arnold Schwarzenegger said &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; in The Terminator, it seems he was actually referring to his appearance in a Belarusian MMO in 2021. the next World Of Tanks Holiday Ops event will be starring none other than the man himself, as he adds another notch to his, admittedly, quite large belt.

Techland&#x27;s most recent episode of its video series Dying 2 Know shows off 15 minutes of gameplay and has an extra surprise at the end, which will be spoiled here, I guess. It&#x27;s free games!
Senior producer Kornel Jaskuła sets up the footage (at the 4:36 mark in the video above), which starts with protagonist Aiden Caldwell and his associate Lowain, played by Rosario Dawson, celebrating The City&#x27;s power roaring back to life before suddenly shutting back down. From there, you&#x27;ll see plenty of what I&#x27;m now calling &quot;the Five P&#x27;s of Dying Light 2 Stay Human&quot;: Parkour, Paragliding, Politicking, Powering structures, and Popping zombies in the mouth with a lethal weapon ... It&#x27;s not a perfect mnemonic. It covers a mission titled &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; that shows off plenty of traversal, fighting, NPC interactions, and how your choices affect The City, its residents, and Aiden&#x27;s relationships.
At the tail end of the broadcast, it&#x27;s announced that Techland is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and it&#x27;s the one giving out the gifts! Starting today on GOG, you can pick up a $0.00 copy of 2001&#x27;s Crime Cities, and next week Steam will be harboring a complimentary copy of Call of Juarez: Gunslinger to add to your library.
For more in-depth, hands-on impressions of Dying Light 2, please see your way to this New Gameplay Today and Brian Shea&#x27;s piece on his time at the game&#x27;s recent preview event.</span>

However, during the 2018 Game Awards, fans were treated to the announcement that an expanded version of the game, The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, would arrive in 2019. It&#x27;s now 2021, though developers Davey Wreden and Crows Crows Crows have always been the first to admit that window may have been wishful thinking. But after three years and a few sassy trailer updates, the game appears to be ready to ship – for real this time (hopefully).
Crow Crows Crows announced on Twitter that The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is now content complete and is prepping to release it to consoles and PC in early 2022. This marks the first time the game will be available on consoles, though there’s still no mention of specific platforms. The game’s website only states the intention to release it to all platforms, basically.

For those who missed the boat in 2013, you may be asking, “what exactly is The Stanley Parable?”. Good question, and unfortunately, it’s one of those games that’s best experienced as blindly as possible. But if you really need to know what you’re playing before committing cash to it (fair), you can read our review of the original game here.
Are you a Stanley Parable fan looking to revisit the experience with Ultra Deluxe? Are you diving in for the first time to see what the fuss has been all these years? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Quake, which was re-released for modern consoles and PC back in August, is receiving even more love from the devs at Bethesda and Wolfenstein developer Machine Games with a new mode and content added with Update 2.
Out today on all platforms, Update 2 brings a host of big fixes, but most importantly, an entirely new Horde Mode. Developed by the team at Machine Games, Quakes Horde Mode pits teams of 1-4 local or online players (or bots!) against swarms of AI enemies on four brand new horde maps. Every third wave of baddies will include a boss which coughs up a silver key which can be cashed in to collect more weapons and items, bolstering your arsenal for further battles.

Also included in Update 2 is an add-on called Honey where you&#x27;ll &quot;delve deep into the darkness to conquer a deadly plague infecting the land.&quot; It&#x27;s a new Quake experience authored by senior level designer Christian Grawer from Machine Games.
Quake is making its Epic Games Store debut today, as well. Pick it up there if EGS is your PC game launcher of choice. You can find the full contents of Update 2 here.

                    <span>Moss is one of the better received PlayStation VR games, and Moss: Book II continues the adventure of Quill next spring. A new trailer gives a sneak peek at the journey that lies ahead for our diminutive heroine. 
Quill has hatched a plan to bring down the Arcane’s violent rule, but she’s being hunted by a winged foe. As she explores the castle that held her uncle Argus captive in the first game, she’ll encounter friends new and old while also solving devious puzzles and cutting down obstacles with her trusty sword.

                    <span>Platformers used to be a dominant gaming genre, but today they often feel like a relic of a bygone era. Even so, 2021 has seen the release of several stellar platformers. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge your hand-eye coordination and jumping skills, then look no further than this list. The following games all share common elements but carve a unique path in the genre. Listed in no particular order, here are 10 incredible platformers that you shouldn’t miss.

PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC
Heart Machine has delivered a visually bold, kinetic platformer in Solar Ash. A voidrunner named Rei is tasked with collapsing the Ultravoid, a massive black hole on the verge of consuming her planet. Motion is central to Solar Ash with Rei’s abilities…</span>

                    <span>Teardown is maybe my favourite game from the past couple of years, and today it smashed through another wall on the way to being finished. The newest update adds &quot;part 2&quot;, completing its campaign by adding new missions and maps - as well as robots and mod tools.

In a new roadmap video and post, IOI have outlined a new Santa mission for the murder sim, plus the return of old elusive targets.

Developed by a different studio than the original game, it looks to let you wander around your city like a skyscraper-sized mayor, drawing out roads with the VR wands. It could be cool, maybe. Watch the trailer below.

It&#x27;s a follow-up to their previous game, Hyper Light Drifter, but this time around they&#x27;ve swapped the 2D style for 3D, and are sending you out into a big open world. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to jumping into its lush and colourful alien landscapes. Oh, to be a sci-fi skater.

                    <span>As much as I enjoy your Call Of Dutys and Valorants, I just don’t think any multiplayer shooter will eclipse Gears Of War. For me, at least, it comes down to movement. The way the beefy boys slide into cover and bounce off it with ease. The side-steps and strafes in those tight-knit shotgun battles.
Recently, I wondered if there was more to my connection with Gears and its lovely movement. And then it struck me: badminton. Yes, the racquet sport I’ve played for 19 years and consider an immensely important aspect of my life. Turns out they have quite a lot in common, actually.

                    <span>The release of the new live-action Cowboy Bebop reminded me just how much I love the show, and how hard it is to find anything remotely like it. I think it’s just because of how eclectic the show is. It’s got so many different influences, ranging from Chinese action films to space operas to even the Western. It’s rare to see something with the same tone, because of how many things compose its DNA.

                    <span>Let me start out by immediately apologising to our podcast editor Alix for the fact that this best cars in games episode of The Electronic Wireless Show Podcast does not mention the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV. Mea culpa. But that glaring mistake aside, we do have a bit of a chat about Forza Horizon 5, and other good cars in games and car games in general. I balance out not talking about the Regalia by not mentioning any vehicles from the Mass Effect games.
We also have a very good Cyberpunk-themed Cavern Of Lies courtesy of Matthew, who has no updates on his Olympic feud this week, but does reaveal (during a long digression about whether or not we, personally, can drive) that it took him nine goes to pass his driving test. Nine honestly seems a bit excessive.

To celebrate Halo Infinite&#x27;s release, as well as Halo&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Xbox have collaborated with Swarovski to make the Halo-themed crystals that fans can win via a sweepstakes or charity campaign. You can&#x27;t buy them. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d want to? They look very expensive.

                    <span>Another month, another batch of games arriving (and leaving) Xbox Game Pass. Are there interesting games coming to the subscription service this month? Yes, but this is true so often that I&#x27;ve grown blasé. I am a hedonistic king and I have grown weary of pleasure. Stardew Valley, Halo Infinite and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator cannot rouse me out of ennui.

                    <span>&quot;Titanfall is part of our DNA,&quot; says the latest announcement from Respawn Entertainment, before going on to reveal that they&#x27;re having gene therapy. Titanfall 1, the studio&#x27;s first game, is being removed from sale today and will disappear from subscription services on March 1st, 2022. It&#x27;s the inevitable end for the wall-running mech battler, a multiplayer experiment that started cutting bits out of itself mere months after release.

Version 1.5.5 was released today, and while it adds no new content it makes &quot;some important technical changes for modders, some quality of life changes, and some bug fixes&quot; for the farming simulator.

                    <span>The folks over at Heart Machine have slid back into the fold with a game set in the same universe as their action-adventure debut Hyper Light Drifter. Except this time it’s not a top-down hack-and-slasher, but a stylish skate to save a civilisation on the brink of collapse. Solar Ash sees you flipping onto the backs of massive monsters and felling them like you’re performing athletic acupuncture. So yes, it does retain something from its predecessor, and that’s the element of cool. This is a cool game. One that excels when it lets you off the leash, only, that doesn’t happen as often as I’d have liked.

On December 15th, players will be able to jump into a fresh set of campaign missions in the looter shooter, but instead of playing as your usual Warframe, you&#x27;ll hop into the shoes of a bunch of different characters. The devs call it a &quot;cinematic expansion&quot; that&#x27;s  chock-full of story stuff answering &quot;long-standing questions&quot; about the game&#x27;s universe.

                    <span>Last year, Overwatch introduced an experimental mode that Blizzard have mostly used to test potential balance changes, and show players what the devs have been messing around with internally. They tend to be fairly minor tweaks, and there hasn&#x27;t been an experimental update in a little while. But last night we finally got a new one, and from what I&#x27;ve played it&#x27;s full of daft and fun tweaks. Prepare yourselves for flying Roadhogs and Genjis, nanoboosted Anas, and a handful of wonderfully-timed voicelines.

The co-op shooter will also introduce new guns, challenge cards and a place for you to see your alien-bashing stats. What&#x27;s more,  it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass too. I was never going to buy this game, but I&#x27;d love to try it out. Thanks for that one, Game Pass.

The developers have announced plans to release version 1.0 on the 2nd of February, 2022. The care and attention to detail of this mod is stunning, looking so much nicer than both Capcom&#x27;s official makeover and the recent Resident Evil 4 VR, and I can hardly wait to play RE4 again with it.

                    <span>Halo Infinite surprise-launched its multiplayer a couple of weeks ago. People seem to like it a lot, grindy and unrewarding battle pass aside. If you, like me, are more interested in the game for its singleplayer, then have a gander below for the launch trailer put together ahead of the campaign&#x27;s December 8th release.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t much envy Bethesda. All game development seems like a bunfight with the impossible, but following in the footsteps of Skyrim is surely cursed. Starfield, the team&#x27;s sci-fi open-world game, needs to be the same and different and better than Skyrim, a game that has been consistently popular for ten years.

In the latest, teasing, behind-the-scenes Into The Starfield video, the development team discuss some of the values that remain the same between Starfield and Bethesda&#x27;s other games. It maybe starts with the cups.

                    <span>The Grand Theft Auto games are full of jokes - or, as I like to call them, &quot;jokes&quot;. I&#x27;m referring to the series&#x27; habit of replacing words in signs and company names with rude soundalikes or double entendres.

These jokes have been restored by GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&#x27;s latest patch, which corrects spelling on signage, puts the hard angles back on the Tuff Nut logo, and stops it raining indoors quite so often.

Released on PC today following Apple Arcade and Switch versions, it&#x27;s made by a team including two heavy-hitting murdergame veterans: the director of the Zero Escape series, and the writer of Danganronpa. It&#x27;s about a group of schoolchildren who find themselves in an undersea theme park and are forced by a clown to- oh for, what is it with these cheery mascots who have one jacked-up eye and a propensity for violence?

Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 arrived today, bringing with it deeper underground layers, taller mountains, and a couple of new biomes to explore. I&#x27;ve been really eager for the 1.18 update specifically so I can build a nice home in the new Lush Cave biomes. Underground houses are the best! And now I can live near pretty cave plants!

Atari are releasing Sid Meier&#x27;s classic Command series on Steam tonight, so you&#x27;ll be able to get your hands on Decision In The Desert, Crusade In Europe, and Conflict In Vietnam. They&#x27;re a vintage bunch of RTS games that make you a commander in various wars, you know, if wars were about controlling tiny little blocky tanks in a bright blue desert.

                    <span>In the last few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time looking through scopes. Red dots and ACOGs and telescopic ones. From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s tactical FPS Rainbow Six Siege ushered in Year 6 Season 4 today. Named High Calibre, it introduces new defensive operator Thorn, who&#x27;s special gadget is a sticky grenade that explodes into razors when it detects an enemy. Ouch. The other big change with this season is a rework of the Outback map, which cleans up a lot of junk to improve sightlines, and help attackers strategise.

Tactical RPG Wartales gave me the opportunity to promote a wild boar to the captain of my troupe of wandering mercenaries. I did not. Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

Clarity Boost, as they call it, aims to make games look better through some client-side processing fanciness. The feature is currently only supported in a test version of the Microsoft Edge browser, planning to roll out to regular Edge soon.

                    <span>Though Halo Infinite launched in decent shape (our Ed called it &quot;the most stable FPS I&#x27;ve played all year&quot;), one bone of contention has been the slow pace to unlocking things on the battle pass. The developers, 343 Industries already boosted progression pace, but evidently that wasn&#x27;t enough, and now they&#x27;re coming round for another pass at the pass. From today, they&#x27;re planning to offer bonus XP for the first six matches you play every day.

They say the extra three months will help ensure their team keep a healthy work-life balance, while having more time to add polish and go through QA.

CDPR had previously said Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s next-gen console update would be out by then, but confirming another big patch for everyone then too is news. Not big news, but welcome news, especially considering how many new players the game has picked up since going half-price in Black Friday sales.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

                    <span>Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she&#x27;s written a message on the palm of her hand reading &quot;He is alive&quot;. I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

I hope you and your loved ones are together as you celebrate 90s cyberspace, cyberculture, cyberpunk, hackers, kewl d00dz, and netizens.

Maybe you&#x27;re gathered round an overclocked Pentium 3 to warm your datagloves and roast Doritos. Whatever you&#x27;re doing, please put on your mirrorshades to enjoy some of our cyberwords from across the years.

Relic Entertainment today announced a &quot;multiplayer pre-alpha&quot; will start on Tuesday, with several modes and maps to give a taste of battling across Italy for a few days. It&#x27;ll be free, everyone is invited, and you can start pre-loading the client today.

                    <span>Gamesplanet is the next in a long line of vendors to post up its seasonal offerings - now into its second week of Xmas deals. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year&#x27;s festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that&#x27;s where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

                    <span>Earlier this month, Platinum Games held a closed beta for their upcoming action RPG, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that&#x27;s because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

                    <span>It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

The 128GB version of Oculus&#x27; standalone headset is now down to £249 for Cyber Monday, knocking £50 off the price of the headset. We&#x27;ve only spotted the deal at Amazon at the moment, but the good news is that they&#x27;re still running the £50 / $50 credit voucher promo in additon to the headset saving, which means you save a total of £100 if you buy one today.

                    <span>They Always Run is the closest I’ve come to living out my dream of being a galactic bounty hunter. It’s a 2D platformer with two distinct halves to its gameplay. One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

Players have been posting clips on social media of supposed cheaters using wallhacks, aimbots and more. Now Xbox Halo players are asking developers 343 Industries for an option to turn crossplay off, so they don&#x27;t have to deal with pesky PC hackers.

                    <span>It may be below freezing outside, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our hard working PCs will keep as cool. Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it&#x27;s vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.
Thankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.
