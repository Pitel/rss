Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below:

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

Following on from this morning&#x27;s extraordinary news that Blizzard Entertainment is to suspend service of its games in China, the president of Chinese publishing partner NetEase has blasted the World of Warcraft developer for its role in the breakdown of contract negotiations.
Speaking very candidly on LinkedIn, Simon Zhu, spoke of his disappointment with the separation, stating that he himself had spent &quot;10,000 hours&quot; playing Blizzard games and claiming that he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; not only for himself, but for &quot;all of the players who lived in those worlds&quot;. Most pointedly, Zhu singles out an unnamed &quot;jerk&quot; at Activision Blizzard for, in Zhu&#x27;s opinion, causing damage to the relationship.
&quot;As a gamer who spent 10,000 hours in the world of Azeroth, Starcraft and Overwatch, I feel so heartbroken as I will no longer have the access to my account and memories next year,&quot; began Zhu. &quot;One day, when what has happened behind the scene could be told, developers and gamers will have a whole new level [of] understanding of how much damage a jerk can make.&quot;
&quot;Feel terrible for players who lived in those worlds.&quot;
As we reported earlier, Blizzard Entertainment will suspend service to its range of IPs in the China region, formerly distributed by NetEase. This includes hugely popular titles such as World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Overwatch. It has since been confirmed that mobile title Diablo: Immortal falls under a separate contract and will continue to be distributed by NetEase.
Blizzard Entertainment is currently looking for a new partner to carry its products in the very financially lucrative territory in the future.

Tomorrow sees Supermassive Games launch The Devil in Me, the final &quot;season one&quot; episode of its celebrated Dark Pictures Anthology — And, in keeping with series tradition, the new title features a spooky teaser trailer for the series&#x27; next release, which has now been confirmed as sci-fi shocker Directive 8020.
The preview features a mission report from a lonely vessel in the vast reaches of the stars. Seemingly on a mission to find a new home for humanity, the team has apparently run afoul of some otherworldly intruder — with hints offered that it has the ability to replicate human beings. So, while it&#x27;s very cliche for me to say so, this would suggest a sort of &quot;Alien meets The Thing&quot; vibe. Sounds wicked.
You can check out the new teaser trailer below, as captured by GameTrailers.

As a cool bit of trivia &quot;Directive 8020&quot; is an actual NASA directive. It is a directive issued for &quot;Biological contamination control for outbound and inbound planetary spacecraft&quot;. This is all well and good on paper, but it will be interesting to see how it works out within the reality of some terrifying, shapeshifting monstrosity. Let&#x27;s just wait here for a while... See what happens.
The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches tomorrow, November 18, on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox.

                              <span>NetEase license ends January 2023
Blizzard Entertainment has announced that it is preparing to suspend service for all of its gaming properties in China in 2023.
On January 23, Blizzard&#x27;s agreement with Chinese holding company NetEase, which handles regional publishing duties, will expire. The two companies have been unable to negotiate new terms for a contract extension, and thus Blizzard will be taking the severe step of suspending service for all of its online titles — including World of Warcraft, Warcraft III: Reforged, Hearthstone, Diablo III, Diablo: Immortal, StarCraft, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm.
According to an official statement by the publisher, the Chinese release of Overwatch 2, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, and Hearthstone: March of the Lich King &quot;will proceed later this year&quot;. Blizzard Entertainment will continue to see a new publishing partner in the highly lucrative market.

NetEase has handled Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s output in China since way back in 2008, so this decision is quite surprising. Additional reporting by Bloomberg suggests that the failed contract negotiations were not just a matter of money, but also disputes on how to handle player data and general IP management. No doubt the news will also come as a major shock to the many Chinese esports players/teams that have built their brand around Blizzard games.
&quot;We’re immensely grateful for the passion our Chinese community has shown throughout the nearly 20 years we’ve been bringing our games to China through NetEase and other partners,&quot; said Blizzard President Mike Ybarra. &quot;Their enthusiasm and creativity inspire us, and we are looking for alternatives to bring our games back to players in the future.&quot;
You can read Activision Blizzard&#x27;s official statement on the matter on the studio&#x27;s website.
NetEase president Simon Zhu made his candid thoughts very clear on LinkedIn.

                              <span>You couldn&#x27;t write it...
Publisher Deep Silver has announced that the long, long, loooooong late coming Dead Island 2 has been delayed and will not see its intended February 3 release date — The MIA zombie smasher will now arrive on PC and console platforms on April 28, 2023.
&quot;The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,&quot; reads a short statement from Deep Silver. &quot;The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.&quot;
&quot;In the meantime, we will be releasing an exciting new trailer and gameplay at The Dead Island 2 Showcase, which will premiere on December 6 on our Twitch and YouTube channels, as well as on the Dead Island website.&quot;

Whilst you undoubtedly do not need a refresher course, Dead Island 2 has had a long and arduous road to fruition, having first been teased way back at E3 2014. Over the following years, myriad reports of cancellation and delays — with no less than three studios working on the title, led many to believe that the open-world sequel was becoming something of an urban myth. However, a release date was finally announced in August of this year... A release date which has now been pushed just a little further backward.
The best things come to those who wait? We&#x27;ll soon see if this turns out to be an axiom supporter.
Dead Island 2 launches April 28, 2023, on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Epic Games Store).

The game mode offerings in the Call of Duty franchise have really expanded over the years, and with the recent release of Modern Warfare II, there are more modes than ever before. Excluding Warzone as its own, separate thing, the base Call of Duty multiplayer experience has 11 different game types in the main MP playlist, not including the co-op campaign modes you can play with a buddy. You&#x27;ve got the classics in there like Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed, but there are also some new modes to try out like Headquarters and Prison Rescue.
While I&#x27;ve certainly had a ton of fun throwing myself into some games to try out modes I don&#x27;t usually play, I am very much a creature of habit -- Domination is by far my favorite mode, and a lot of the time I&#x27;ll load into the game wi…</span>

                              <span>A new development in the ongoing Doom controversy
Last week, video game composer Mick Gordon issued a lengthy statement detailing his side of the behind-the-scenes details of Doom Eternal&#x27;s soundtrack. Today, Bethesda issued its response.
In Gordon&#x27;s post, the composer alleges that id Software failed to pay him for part of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. He also specifically cites executive producer Marty Stratton&#x27;s letter from 2020 as a statement full of &quot;lies, disinformation, and innuendo.&quot; Issues arose after fans noted sound mixing discrepancies in the Doom Eternal soundtrack.

                              <span>We covered the LG C2 OLED recently, so I&#x27;ll keep this brief: my personal favourite large-size gaming monitor stroke 4K 120Hz TV is down to £759 on Amazon, the lowest ever price we&#x27;ve seen on this model. 
To get this price, you&#x27;ll need to tick the £100 voucher box on the product page (or afterwards in the basket). This promotion is only possible for items shipped by Amazon direct, so check this if you don&#x27;t see the voucher option!

                              <span>A short teaser for the next horror game in Supermassive’s The Dark Pictures Anthology series has emerged on YouTube. Called Directive 8020, it seems like this one is going full sci-fi and heading all the way into outer space, Event Horizon style. The teaser video seems to have been taken from the end of an advance copy of its predecessor The Devil In Me, which is released tomorrow so keep your eyes peeled for our review. Supermassive will likely follow up with an official teaser after The Devil In Me&#x27;s out. You can watch the leaked teaser below, if you’re not spooked by the possibility of spoilers.

                              <span>The publishers of Doom Eternal have shared a strongly worded statement aimed at composer Mick Gordon, following Gordon’s recent outpouring on Medium. Bethesda tweeted their statement last night, calling Gordon’s lengthy post explaining his experience working on Doom Eternal’s soundtrack &quot;a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship”. Gordon had replied to an open letter published on Reddit by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton, more than two years after Stratton’s letter was posted online.

That&#x27;s the choice you&#x27;ll have to make between these two Dell monitor deals at Dell&#x27;s US outlet, with Black Friday prices on a 24-in 1080p 240Hz monitor ideal for competitive gaming or a 32-in 4K 144Hz model with HDMI 2.1 that would suit a high-end gaming PC, PS5 or Series X. Both are incredibly good value after today&#x27;s discounts, and well worth taking a look at if you&#x27;re in the market for a monitor upgrade!

From inside Teams, you can now play procrastination classics like Solitaire and Minesweeper as well as party games meant for oodles of people. You can even play co-op Minesweeper. And hey, if it happens inside Teams, no one can deny it&#x27;s work. If anything, you&#x27;re engaging with the business experience even harder. Be sure to mention that in your annual performance review.

Horror publisher Feardemic is trying its hand with something new and unique: a point and click adventure puzzler called Papetura, launching on the Nintendo Switch on December 1st, 2022.
Created by one person over the course of six years, Papetura stars Pape and Tura (ah, we get it!) in a hand-crafted paper world that&#x27;s at constant risk of burning down. With a slick runtime of around 2 hours, the game makes the most out of every scene, its world bursting with character and detail.

The role of a debugger is an important one in any kind of games development. These are the people who play through the games as they are being developed, pointing out any moment in which it goes wrong and crashes or lets the player do something that they shouldn&#x27;t normally be able to. In years gone by, the debuggers had to record their gameplay sessions on tapes to catch any mistakes, before turning them into the development team who would then analyse and recode.
Some of these very tapes have now been acquired by the YouTube channel Hard4Games, who has tidied up the footage and put together a video on the findings therein.

If there’s one thing we always hope for with a brand-new Pokémon generation, it’s a sense of childlike wonder. Of course, it’s not always a guarantee, especially with a formula that has been followed consistently for the last 26 years, but we always start a new generation with our fingers crossed that we&#x27;ll be charmed out of the gate by the new creatures to collect and a whole new region to explore. And if anything has come close to recapturing the real magic we felt when we discovered our first Pokémon world in Red &amp; Blue, it’s Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet&#x27;s vast and open Paldea region. It’s been a while since we’ve felt like a kid stepping out of our Pokémon house and just looking at the world and savouring the taste of adventure. Despite some pretty significant technical stumbles, this introduction to Generation 9 nails that, even if it’s not the new Pokémon revolution that Legends: Arceus felt like.
Scarlet &amp; Violet’s promise of being the main series’ first open-world game isn’t a false one. Every inch of Paldea is ours for the taking, and we’re ready for adventure just like the little kids who booted up their Game Boys for the first time and took their first steps in Kanto. Adventure awaits, and it’s right on our doorstep. Except things don’t start that way.

                              <span>Česko.Digital získává podporu přes 7 milionů korun od Google.org na rozvoj digitálních dovedností Čechů. Česko.Digital je komunita expertních dobrovolníků z mnoha oborů od IT přes projektové řízení až po marketing. Jejím cílem je budoucnost, ve které technologie slouží lidem, bez ohledu na čas, místo nebo sociální podmínky. Tato vize, společně s úspěšnými projekty, které Česko.Digital již realizovalo, zaujala společnost Google. Google.org, filantropická odnož Googlu, se rozhodla organizaci podpořit na 2 roky částkou 300 tisíc USD (přibližně 7,3 milionů korun), které Česko.Digital investuje do rozvoje komunity a do cílených aktivit, které pomohou snížit dopady digitálních nerovností (tzv. digital divide).</span>

                              <span>Ragnarok and roll on to the next one
Sony&#x27;s Santa Monica Studios may have a few projects under its wing at the moment. In a new interview, Santa Monica Studios&#x27; Cory Barlog says the studio is currently spread out across a lot of different things.
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Barlog says Sony Santa Monica Studio is currently &quot;spread out on a lot of different things.&quot; The director declines to specify what those are. But as the LA Times points out, there were rumors of a sci-fi project at the studio that was cancelled. Sony Santa Monica has also helped publish games in the past, like Journey.
Santa Monica Studio just launched God of War Ragnarok. the follow-up to the 2018 God of War reboot. And as Ragnarok director Eric Williams puts it, being the God of War studio isn&#x27;t a bad thing.
“I remember talking to someone from another game company, where they were trying to get me to leave,&quot; Williams told the LA Times. &quot;They said, &#x27;Do you just want to be known as the God of War guy for the rest of your life?&#x27; That was your big pitch to dissuade me? Because yes, I kind of do.”

Ancient myths and new legends
Considering the studio just wrapped one big game, expecting something new right away wouldn&#x27;t make much sense. The studio has yet to announce its next project, but that&#x27;s kind of like asking someone who just finished a marathon about tomorrow&#x27;s run.
Meanwhile, studio has been clear that Ragnarok is the end of the Norse saga for Kratos and crew. Whatever&#x27;s next seems like it&#x27;ll be a new step forward in some way.

                              <span>Cyberpunk&#x27;s first DLC is right around the corner
Fans of CD Projekt Red&#x27;s most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077, have been waiting quite some time now to learn some more information about the game&#x27;s first official DLC: Phantom Liberty. News of the spy thriller expansion was first released back in September via a teaser trailer, and we know it&#x27;s scheduled to drop sometime in 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S (Stadia is also listed as a platform for release in the official Cyberpunk website&#x27;s blog post from a few months ago, but I have a feeling that one is subject to change).
While news of a more specific release window is up in the air, we do have confirmation as of today that Phantom Liberty will be paid DLC expansion, but we don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;ll be yet, either. Paying for DLC is something that CD Projekt fans know well (just look at The Witcher 3), and if I had to guess based on precedence, I&#x27;d say this new expansion should be somewhere around $20 depending on how big it is. In a comment to GamesRadar+, the global PR director for CDPR, Radek Grabowski, said that the expansions are &quot;traditionally cheaper than full-price games,&quot; so at the very least we know it won&#x27;t be $60. We&#x27;ll take what we can get at this point.

This likely won&#x27;t be the only DLC we see for Cyberpunk, either, but if you ask me a spy thriller theme is a great place to start. I imagine the adventure will have something to do with corporate espionage, and if we&#x27;re basing predictions on the past Witcher DLC, there&#x27;s a good chance we could see new maps and characters, and even get a whole new synth-style soundtrack. I for one will be excited to see what comes next for Night City, especially after the renewed hype for the game from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime.

The Gamecube occupies a nice little corner of my personal history when hormones were sabotaging any chance I had for a normal adulthood. As such, I view it with quite a lot of fondness. It didn’t have the massive library of the PS2, nor the substantial beef of the Xbox, but it did have one thing that gave it an edge over its competitors: a handle.
Below are five games that I picked out of its library to represent its best. You don’t have to agree, but if you come in here making claims that Pikmin 2 was the best game in its library, you’re wrong and should leave.

F-zero GX
There were quite a few games that I was super into when I was a teenager, but I think F-Zero GX might be the big winner. It was just really slick and had a lot to do. Just when you think y…</span>

                              <span>So yeah, Mr. X, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m back
The Streets of Rage are headed to the silver screen. Lionsgate has picked up the film adaptation of the beat &#x27;em up Streets of Rage, with John Wick writer Derek Kolstad writing.
This news was reported on earlier this year by Deadline. Today&#x27;s confirmation sees the Streets of Rage project finding a home at Lionsgate, with Kolstad producing alongside Toru Nakahara. Dj2 Entertainment&#x27;s Dmitri M. Johnson, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Dan Jevons are also on board, as well as Escape Artists&#x27; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Tony Shaw.
Dj2 Entertainment is important to note, as the company worked on the recent Sonic the Hedgehog film series and is also looking to adapt It Takes Two.

Streets of Rage saw a bit of a revival, thanks to the 2020 release of Streets of Rage 4 that went over pretty well. It&#x27;s a classic in the beat &#x27;em up genre, and it&#x27;s easy to see how someone behind the John Wick series would gravitate to a property like this.
&quot;When Dmitri first mentioned the idea of cracking a Streets of Rage movie, I was so immediately freaking in,&quot; Kolstad said in a statement via Variety. “And to play with Sega? The 10-year-old me is still grinning.”
A new adaptation
This adds another video game to the long list of upcoming video game adaptations. It&#x27;s become a popular trend, as productions like Arcane and Sonic the Hedgehog have worked out pretty well. Even Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and The Witcher, based off media properties that existed before their game counterparts, saw boosts thanks to their series&#x27; successes.
For Streets of Rage? I&#x27;m just hoping for some brawling action with the series&#x27; best. I could easily see a found-family story about a rag-tag crew of fighters working here. And it&#x27;s a good excuse to play some more Streets of Rage, too.

Following on from this weekend&#x27;s leak, developer Firaxis has officially announced the Civilization VI Leader Pass, which will see the coming months roll out a who&#x27;s who of famed leaders, dictators, and visionaries to the grand strategy sequel.
The first DLC drop, &quot;The Great Negotiators&quot; will launch on November 21 and will bring with it diplomatic masters Abraham Lincoln (United States) Queen Nzinga Mbande (Kongo), and Sultan Saladin (Arabia). Each leader brings to the table bespoke skills and abilities to help players grow and expand their presence within their home territories as well as in the global political picture.

The remaining five packs, which are yet to be dated, contain the following DLC leaders. All packs will be released by spring 2023.
Great Commanders Pack: Tokugawa (Japan), Nader Shah (Persia), and Suleiman the Magnificent (Ottoman Empire).
Rulers of China Pack: Yongle, Qin Shi Huang the Unifier, and Wu Zetian (All China).
Rulers of the Sahara Pack: King Ramses (Egypt), Ptolemaic Cleopatra (Egypt), King Sundiata Keita (Mali).
Great Builders Pack: Theodora (Byzantine Empire), Sejong (Korea), and Ludwig II (Germany).
Ruler of England Pack: Elizabeth I (England), Varangian Harald Hardrada (Norway), and Victoria: Age of Steam (England).
Note that some of the included leaders will require their respective scenarios and expansions in order to play. (For example: Nader Shah requires the previously releases Persia &amp; Macedon Scenario Pack).
The Civilization VI: Leader Pass is included as part of the Civilization VI Anthology. It will also be available to purchase separately on Steam and Epic Game Store. A price was not revealed.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 just launched Warzone 2.0 (read: battle royale) with the Al Mazrah map, on top of a beta for the DMZ mode. If you&#x27;re in the mood for more battle royales, it sounds exciting. But of course, it&#x27;s a AAA game release, so not everything is rolling out quite so smoothly for existing owners.
I went through this process today, and can save you a headache.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; columns&#x3D;&quot;2&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;350203,350202&quot;]
If you already own Modern Warfare 2, re-download these packs
So I had Modern Warfare 2 already installed on my PS5, and even though the icon was updated to show Warzone 2.0, it actually wasn&#x27;t integrated in the game yet.
To rectify this (after trying to frantically locate it via in-game menus), I deleted the entire game and re-installed it. You can also opt to re-install the &quot;Multiplayer and &quot;Warzone 2&quot; packs by managing your game on the home screen. After you re-install the packs, then load up the game, you&#x27;ll see a completely different launcher (like the one in the above second screenshot).

If you don&#x27;t, you can find Warzone 2.0 on the PSN or Xbox storefronts
Alternatively, there is a Warzone 2.0 direct download in the PSN/Xbox storefronts.
Search for Modern Warfare 2, and it&#x27;ll come up with the above icon in tow (the highlighted game). It&#x27;s simply called &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0.&quot;

There is increasing evidence that Ubisoft is getting set to make its return to PC&#x27;s popular digital retail platform, Steam. The publisher essentially left the platform in 2019, choosing to release all of its PC out via its in-house Uplay service and later on Epic Games Store.
The first sign that Ubisoft might be heading back to chez Valve came earlier in November, when a Steam port of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla was found lurking in the Ubisoft Connect database. The epic Norse adventure, which first launched back in 2020, will be receiving its final update next month, and thus is a prime candidate for a &quot;complete edition&quot; debut on Steam in time for the holidays.
But Ubisoft&#x27;s comeback plans were practically confirmed yesterday, when then colorful wheelie racer Roller Champions made a brief appearance on the Steamdb. Initially spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, the free-to-play title swiftly had its status hidden shortly thereafter. But, given the clarity of these two leaks, it seems highly likely that we can expect an official announcement from Ubisoft soon. As a somewhat-struggling multiplayer-centric title, a new Steam port could only serve to widen the Roller Champions audience and benefit the game as a whole.
Ubisoft is currently working on Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, which will launch for PC and consoles in 2023.

                              <span>God of War 2 is still the king, and I think a lot of you agree
God of War has been around for 17 long years, and with Ragnarok still fresh in everyone&#x27;s minds, we figured it was worth taking a look at a few of the best games in the series.
Here&#x27;s a list of the top three God of War games to date!

3 - God of War Ragnarok (2022)
I&#x27;ve had access to God of War Ragnarok for weeks at this point: which is solely a statement on how much I&#x27;ve been absorbed with it, and nothing more!
Ragnarok is a fantastic modern action game that builds upon a a lot of what the 2018 laid down, while adding its own twists, turns, and character moments. There are some points that feel rushed, and give credence to the suggestion that this Norse story should have been a trilogy: but it does stick the landing, and has a…</span>

                              <span>Take us back to 2016
I&#x27;ve been playing Overwatch on and off basically since day one, so I&#x27;ve seen the game through all of its changes, for better and for worse. With every nerf, rework, and new hero drop, the game has evolved so much since 2016, and to many fans, it&#x27;s not even worth playing anymore, especially after the Overwatch 2 relaunch. Despite my qualms with the series (of which I have many, including recently getting hit with a ban from the entirety of Season One after a series of unfortunate disconnections from competitive matches), it&#x27;s still one of my favorite and most-played games to date. That being said, the roster is filling out fast, and I don&#x27;t find myself too thrilled with the most recent additions.
I want to be clear here–I am absolutely biased and have a rose-colored vie…</span>

A new, free title update is on its way to Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion to Monster Hunter Rise picks up some more monsters, as well as new layered weapons, Follower potential, and more in Free Title Update 3.
Free Title Update 3 rolls out on November 24, for everyone who owns Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion&#x27;s currently available, on both Nintendo Switch and Steam.
This update includes, of course, more monsters. Plenty of big new baddies will be available to hunt, including the giant Chaotic Gore Magala. They seem like a bad time.

If your friends are too intimidated by the hunt, you can always call on Followers. The AI companions had events like Follower Quests, which let the various NPCs of Monster Hunter Rise team up with you for a special trek.
Free Title Update 3 will let you bring Followers along on Master Rank and Anomaly Research quests as well. And hunters might need the help too, as new monsters are being added to the Anomaly Research quests.
Breaking dawn
Weekly event quests are in store too, which will have unique rewards for hunters who finish the quests. And if you want even more cosmetics, there&#x27;s some paid DLC in store for Sunbreak.
New layered weapons are on the way as paid DLC. Layered weapons are essentially weapon skins, which modify the appearance but not the stats of a given weapon. These particular layered weapons are stuffed versions of popular Monster Hunter monsters. Whoever turned the Khezu into a weapon is a creative and devilish mastermind.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak&#x27;s Free Title Update 3 goes live on November 24.

                              <span>The Splattershot Nova and Brinewater Springs are coming in the new season
Splatoon 3 is about to get a whole lot busier with its new &quot;Chill Season,&quot; unveiled this week. But thanks to some new tweets, we now have a better idea of what the patch will usher in.
Coming on December 1, we&#x27;re getting more stages (I stress more, because some are old), including the Brinewater Springs arena; as well as more weapons, like the Splattershot Nova. The latter is really interesting based on the description: &quot;Its power won&#x27;t blow up a planet or anything, but you can fire all day long without affecting your aim. Splat speed ahead!&quot; Both can be viewed in the tweets below.
While we knew another season was upon us, the high-energy Pokemon Splatfest and this new season are a great shot in the arm for Splatoon 3. While the game had a lot going for it at launch, a lot of folks were a bit tired of it a month in. For me, Big Run could be the crown jewel of the update/Chill Season: which allows players to swap the standard Salmon Run map for a rotating selection of core multiplayer levels (beginning with Wahoo World).
Hopefully more of these types of updates are on the way. The frequency likely won&#x27;t change, but at the very least, the team can supplement them with surgical quality of life changes and tweaks to build on the foundation that&#x27;s already there.
Here&#x27;s a look at the Splattershot Nova

Phil Spencer has offered up some new information as to why his company decided to shelve plans for a streaming-only edition of the Xbox platform — The console, codenamed &quot;Keystone&quot;, had been in development at the studio but work was officially halted back in the summer of this year.
The Keystone project had hoped to develop an Xbox alternative that would neither feature a disk drive nor would allow for digital game downloads, and instead would run purely as a device to stream and play games live from Xbox&#x27;s huge library of current and classic releases. Development had reached the prototype stage, with an early edition of the would-be tech appearing in the background of Spencer&#x27;s office during a previous Xbox presentation.

                              <span>Shoot that poison arrow...
Capcom has released the first significant DLC drop for its survival horror multiplayer title Resident Evil Re:Verse — Focusing on smash-seller Resident Evil Village, the first roster addition sees the coming of Hound Wolf specialist Tundra, as well as a creepy new map from the dilapidated town itself.
Emily Berkhoff, better known by her call-sign &quot;Tundra&quot;, is one of the mysterious officers serving within Chris Redfield&#x27;s BSAA unit, Hound Wolf. Loyal to the cause, Berkoff administers her duty with cold, ruthless calculation. Berkoff rose through the ranks of the DEA to join the BSA as a drug and poison specialist — a skill which, as Tundra, she uses to deadly effect in the violent confrontations of Resident Evil Re:Verse.

The new map, simply titled &quot;Village&quot;, focuses on the town square and its ominous Maiden of War centerpiece. The icy air and brutal, ragged stone environment will test the killing skills of even the most hardened mercenary... erm... Re:Verser. Offering wide-open areas of conflict, as well as plenty of waist-high cover, Village should offer tactical engagement options for all play styles.

In addition to the arrival of Tundra and Village, two classic character skins have also been made available for purchase. The skins reflect series veterans Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine as they appeared in 2009&#x27;s Resident Evil 5, with Chris rocking his boulder-punching biceps, while Ms. Valentine dons her sleek, night-black bodysuit — sans gross, mind-controlling parasite. A new Premium Pass is also available for purchase, which includes tier reward skins for Leon Kennedy and the delectable Ada Wong.
Resident Evil Re:Verse is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

                              <span>It goes over basically everything
A Pokemon Scarlet and Violet recap video just launched on the Japanese Nintendo YouTube account; and spans five minutes of general footage that showcases pretty much every major element of the game.
Although the voiceover is in Japanese, you&#x27;re getting a ton of footage either way, and the gist is easily communicated.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet feature recap:
The clip starts with an overview of some of the key members of the game, as well as another close-up look at the starter trio
We then move into the two legendary Pokemon, who also serve as your motorcycle/mount, which can drive up mountains and fly
The recap transitions into multiplayer, showing off how multiple people can join your game (but only for a brief moment)
Then we get another look at the three &quot;core&quot; storylines: which you can tackle in any order (as a reminder, it&#x27;s Victory Road [trainer battles], Path of Legends [an explorer-themed questline], and Starfall Street [the antagonistic faction similar to Team Rocket]
There&#x27;s a short montage of new creatures
The video then shifts into the Terastallize mechanic, as well as raids with multiple trainers/players
The ability to take photos wasn&#x27;t widely shown off before today, so if you&#x27;re interested in the more chill/social elements, tune in around 4:30 for some extra footage
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are due on November 18, and will continue the &quot;dual&quot; release model following Pokemon Legends&#x27; single release. I&#x27;m mostly on board, but I hope that the &quot;open world&quot; truly is open, and has a lot to do.
[Update: Nintendo has provided an English version of the trailer as of the week of November 16: which you can watch below.]

                              <span>Sale news from you-know-know
The dedicated king of PlayStation Plus leaks, Dealabs author billbil-kun, has suggested that the black-and-blue brand is preparing to offer a meaty 25% discount on its range of PS Plus paid subscription services — The discount is expected to arrive as part of the forthcoming Black Friday madness.
According to the veteran PS leaker, PlayStation users will be able to pick up 12-month PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscriptions at a quarter of their original price, provided that they are bagged between November 18-28. As a quick refresher, Essential offers monthly free titles and online capabilities, Extra throws in access to a catalog of rotating titles, while Premium users also receive access to the PlayStation Classics range, as well as exclusive demos and trials.
With a 25% discount included, PlayStation owners can expect the following prices in the rumored offer:
PlayStation Plus Essential (12 Month) - $44.99 / €44.99 / £37.49
PlayStation Plus Extra (12 Month) – $74.99 / €74.99 / £62.99
PlayStation Plus Premium (12 Month) – $89.99 / €89.99 / £74.99
Admittedly, in financially tough times such as these, 80 buckeroos for a gaming subscription is still a pretty hefty ask. But if you&#x27;re the type of player to burn through games with reckless abandon, then having access to a constantly rotating catalog of releases across 2023 will, ultimately, pay for itself.
Of course, there is no official word the deal is definitely happening. But, given Dealabs consistent accuracy when revealing PlayStation Plus titles, this Black Friday discount rumor can probably be filed under &quot;concrete&quot;.

                              <span>I got the music in me
A few months ago, the Recording Academy announced it was adding five new categories to its annual Grammy Awards, including a new category solely for soundtracks to video games and other interactive media. A video game grammy award has been a long time coming, given how the medium has produced some of the most outstanding musical scores of the past 20 years. Just yesterday, The Game Awards announced its top picks for Best Score with Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Metal Hellsinger, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnarock, and A Plague Tale: Requiem making the cut. None of those games are up for the inaugural video game soundtrack Grammy, but that probably has to do with release scheduling and other requirements that might not have been met.
Instead, the five games nominated for Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media are:
Aliens: Fireteam Elite (Composer: Austin Wintory)
Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok (Composer: Stephanie Economou)
Call of Duty: Vanguard (Composer: Bear McCreary)
Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy (Composer: Richard Jacques)
Old World (Composer: Christopher Tin)
Your guess is as good as mine as to what Old World is, but there are few recognizable names on that list. Bear McCreary is perhaps best known across the industry for his work scoring films like Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as video games like God of War and God of War Ragnarok. Austin Wintory is also a name you should know, given his work on titles like Journey and The Banner Saga trilogy.
To find out who takes home the inaugural video game Grammy, tune in to the Grammy pre-show on February 5, where this award is most likely to be handed out.

                              <span>We miss you, Mei
Blizzard has been dealing with all kinds of bugs since the release of Overwatch 2, and in a few instances, have had to remove certain characters from the game to ensure players don&#x27;t use exploits in the game. Mei is the most recent hero to disappear from the roster, and now she&#x27;s not expected to return for another couple of days. That&#x27;s right -- the mid-season patch has officially been delayed.
While the original announcement stated that the delay would be indefinite, an update as of today at 4:00 pm PST let us know that we only have to wait until the end of the week, because the new ETA for the patch is this Friday, November 17 at 11:00 am PST. Phew, don&#x27;t scare us like that, Blizzard.
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1592594536215158786
The patch will include &quot;balance changes, bug fixes, including those that affect Mei,&quot; as well as &quot;core content updates.&quot; The delay will also impact &quot;the delivery of Overwatch League Viewership Incentives &amp; Perks from the Postseason matches during the period between Oct 30 - Nov 4, along with the rotation of cosmetics in the Overwatch League shop.&quot; The daily and weekly challenges also reset today like normal, along with the &quot;standard shop refresh.&quot;
Thankfully things aren&#x27;t as bleak as they originally appeared, because the game never feels the same when any of the heroes are missing. After Bastion was pulled a few weeks ago for balance changes as well, the internet was flooded with memes, including some hilariously edited missing persons (omnics?) posters. I&#x27;m a bit torn about Mei&#x27;s disappearance myself -- on one hand, I kind of miss the chaos of having an unhinged Mei player on my team, but I definitely don&#x27;t miss getting and frozen, walled off, and icicled to the head. Regardless, a two day wait is nothing, and our favorite Arctic scientist will be returned to her rightful place soon enough.

                              <span>Mechanical keyboards are brilliant. If you agree, you probably have one on your desk right now - and we have just the deal for you. SteelSeries&#x27; PrismCaps are an awesome upgrade over your stock keycaps, offering high-quality PBT construction, backlit legends and a beautiful two-tone &#x27;pudding cup&#x27; design that looks great, especially with an RGB keyboard. 
Normally a full keycap set of PrismCaps will cost you $30, but as an early Black Friday deal you can find these keycaps for 50% off - just $15. At that price, these are in impulse buy territory for me, as they&#x27;ll provide an immediate uplift over your existing keycaps and last for decades.

                              <span>Do you ever feel like multiplayer games would be better if other players were less abusive? Ubisoft and Riot Games are looking into training artificial intelligence to tackle bad behaviours within in-game chat, a research collaboration they’re calling Zero Harm In Comms. Ahead of their announcement today, I put some questions to Ubisoft La Forge’s executive director Yves Jacquier and Riot’s head of technology research Wesley Kerr to get some more insight on the joint project, and ask them exactly how their proposal will work.

I understand why you made this decision, but I do not have to agree. This might become part of my own backstory. But we must continue, this week picking between something charmingly ever-changing and something perfectly static and reliable. What&#x27;s better: dynamic music, or hex grids?

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16’s producers have shared some more snippets about what to expect from Square Enix’s umpteenth outing in the JRPG series in an interview with Japanese site GameWatch. Nestling in among all the talk of Mother Crystals and summons is a comment from writer Kazutoyo Maehiro that players will get to control another character than just our boy Clive. It sounds like you’ll only get a short while to step into this other, as yet unnamed character’s shoes, however, as they’re only playable in the early game.

Now that Night City is playable, it&#x27;s one of the most transportive video game cities out there, where cold calls from unknown numbers play into the fantasy of transforming from an upstart to a big shot who&#x27;s name travels along its neon-lit back alleys.

                              <span>So. Funny thing about our RTX 4080 review: I sort of don’t have time for it. We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.


Still, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.

                              <span>Two years ago I asked whether anyone had played retro FPS Chasm: The Rift and admitted that I’d never made it past the first level because I was roughly eight years old at the time, and it terrified me. Twenty years later I’ve returned to its re-release - and beaten the first level! And in the process, I’ve developed a particular appreciation for the old-school boomer shooter and its interesting quirks.

                              <span>In the Tom Waits song The Piano Has Been Drinking, the gravel-voiced pianist imitates a pissed-up lounge singer, slurring his way through nonsense lyrics, pounding on the keyboard, and occasionally hitting all of the wrong notes. Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.
Likewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control. As though the invisible hand of a very, very tired QA tester is always on the tiller.

                              <span>A whole bunch of classic Civilization leaders are coming back for Civilization 6’s upcoming Leader Pass, devs Firaxis have confirmed. You can expect 18 more leaders spread out over six DLC pack releases between November 21st and March 2023, 12 of whom are new leaders. Another six will be “new takes” on existing leaders from previous games in the Civ series. The Leader Pass’ existence was leaked by accident last week when promo art for the DLC appeared on the mobile version of the Civ website, before it was removed.

                              <span>Small form factor cases are very much in vogue, with some great options nowadays from the likes of Cooler Master, NZXT and Ssupd. Normally you&#x27;re looking at around $50 to $150 for the case itself, with a further $70 to $100 for a matching SFX power supply, but today there&#x27;s an excellent deal at Amazon US that offers a small form factor case and a 700W PSU for just $130 - after a sizeable $120 discount. 
The case is the HYTE Revolt 3, and it&#x27;s attracted rave reviews for its easy build qualities, great thermals and beautiful design, making it an easy recommendation at this discounted price.

                              <span>Blizzard have postponed the release of a patch for Overwatch 2 so they can fix an undisclosed “critical issue” with the game. The patch had been scheduled for November 15th, and is meant to include hero balance adjustments for Zarya, Genji, Sombra, Kiriko, and D.va. The mid-season update should also see Mei return to the hero shooter after her two-week stint on the bench, Blizzard’s statement said, following issues with her icewall ability last month. You can now expect the patch to arrive tomorrow, November 17th, at 7pm GMT / 9pm CET / 11am PST. Not too long to wait, then.

For one, it&#x27;s set in a science fiction  world in which post-apocalyptic South Korea, the 10th century Byzantine Empire, and a 23rd century future are all somehow colliding. For two, it was revealed yesterday not with a brief logo or a show-nothing cinematic trailer, but with a nine minute video comprehensively depicting the actual game. Watch it below.

                              <span>In August, an Indian court ordered domain registrars including NameCheap, Tucows, Dynadot, and Sarek Oy to disable several pirate site domains. They failed to comply so the judge has just ordered two government agencies to take immediate action. Among other things, they must determine if the domain companies should even be allowed to do business in India.

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
&quot;New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we&#x27;d give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2,&quot; a blog post about the new season reads. &quot;Hailing from planet Mars and sent to destroy Earth with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, M…</span>

Updated with recent releases. Enjoy!

If you&#x27;re looking for a change of pace and some welcome distraction from your everyday life, few mediums offer such engrossing, ongoing escapism as video games. Even the best books have an ending, but some games can go on almost indefinitely and come to form a calming part of our daily routines.

Back in October 2022, a Pokémon GO event called the Shuppet Spotlight Hour took place, with a &quot;special&quot; surprise for people who participated. Niantic ended up cancelling this special surprise at the last minute, but not before those in the GMT +13 time zone in Australia and New Zealand saw it, which meant that the surprise was spoiled.
The surprise was supposed to be an encounter with the Pokémon Zorua, but a bug meant that Zorua would take its moveset, CP, and height from your Buddy Pokémon, allowing some trainers to catch a very beefy Zorua indeed. In response, Niantic removed the ability to actually use or trade the Pokémon, and cancelled the surprise for everyone else, although the Shuppet Spotlight Hour event still went on as otherwise planned.

With every improvement and addition that each new mainline Pokémon entry brings, there are a handful of features that remain unchanged since the launch of the franchise more than 25 years ago: the ability to heal up at a Pokémon Centre, the appearance of the &quot;technology is incredible&quot; guy, and — of course — the option to give your beloved Pocket Monsters nicknames.
During the first few generations of Pokémon, the notion of giving each and every one of your partners its own unique nickname might have seemed reasonably doable. Now that we&#x27;re heading into the ninth generation of the franchise with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, however, there are near-enough 1000 of the beggars to keep track of, so it got us thinking: Do players still go to the effort of nicknaming them all?

Remember print gaming magazines? Although there are a handful that are still active and enjoyed by enthusiasts to this day, it&#x27;s safe to say that the medium is a shadow of its former self, with the rise of the internet making countless print outlets all but obselete.
Still, what&#x27;s great about the internet is you can find a ruddy boatload of print magazines that have been uploaded and archived over the years, just waiting for your eager eyes to scroll over their glorious pages. One such example is Nintendo Power, a dedicated gaming magazine from Nintendo of America (and later Future US) that ran from 1988 to 2012. Thanks to a group of talented archivists working on a project known as &#x27;Retromags&#x27;, all 285 issues are now available to download on Archive.org.

The face of Pokémon GO was forever changed with the release of the Pokémon GO Plus wristband - a way to catch &#x27;em all without even needing to get your phone out of your pocket. Since then there has been a Pokédex-worth of imitators, all keen to bring something new to the catching game.
None more so is this the case than with PhotoFast&#x27;s 247 Catcher - an auto-catching device which stakes a pretty big claim in its ability to catch Pokémon consistently for 120 hours (that&#x27;s five days)! The device is supposed to perform these catches at a pretty speedy rate too, with it taking an estimated 6.5 seconds on each wild encounter.

Shigeru Miyamoto, the celebrated game designer, producer, and director at Nintendo, has turned 70 years old today. Happy Birthday, Miyamoto-san!
Born on November 16, 1952, Miyamoto is widely known for creating some of the most beloved Nintendo franchises of all time, including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Pikmin, and Star Fox. He directed acclaimed titles such as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario 64 before moving into a designer / producer role. In more recent years, he&#x27;s taken on the role as one of Nintendo&#x27;s representative directors and has been working closely with Chris Meledandri at Illumination on the upcoming Super Mario Bros.

                              <span>Football has been banned and only one person can save it. No, it&#x27;s not the self-important fantasy Cristiano Ronaldo dreams every night, it&#x27;s the setup for adventure RPG Soccer Story. You need to travel around its colourful, Nintendo-inspired world, cajole people into kicking balls once more, and then defeat them on the pitch. Soccer Story also now has a release date: November 29th.

                              <span>If you have a Game Pass subscription, I don&#x27;t see why you would buy a game between now and the end of the year. Earlier this month, Football Manager 2023 came to the service, a game so all-consuming it barely leaves time to sleep. Now Microsoft have announced the remaining games to arrive in November, and as expected it includes the year&#x27;s remaining big release, co-op shooter Warhammer 40K: Darktide, as well as several indie darlings.

I&#x27;ve no idea, but if you were previously living with the belief that substantial story additions to blockbuster games with voice acting by Keanu Reeves might be free, then I apologise for bursting your bubble.

                              <span>Like so many games buried deep within my Steam library, I am unsure when I bought Painkiller: Black Edition or my exact reasons for doing so. I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.

                              <span>Season 1 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus is over, and Season 2 has begun today with an update that adds more reward tiers to the battle pass. There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.

                              <span>Just when I thought I had my top 10 games of 2022 sorted, Obsidian release Pentiment, forcing me to shred my former list and grab my quill and ink for a rewrite. It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. 
Its captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it&#x27;s clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it&#x27;s a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.

I&#x27;ve turned to Brotato, a game whose demo I enjoyed in the Steam Next Fest, and which launched into early access in September. I say with great affection: it feels (and looks) like it could have been a Flash game on Newgrounds. Plus it&#x27;s only £4.

                              <span>Warzone 2 drops tomorrow, November 16th, bringing a DMZ extraction mode, Al Mazrah map, and an all-new map-based battle pass. Some Call Of Duty players looking forward to getting their itchy trigger fingers on the free-to-play battle royale have been struggling to sort out their preloads, though. This confusion echoes what happened with Modern Warfare 2019 when Warzone 1.0 launched back in 2020. If you’re bemused by the current preload sitch then watch the Warzone 2.0 launch trailer below, and let Freebird chill you out.

                              <span>Straighten up your big rig’s neon signs and make sure you’re sitting comfortably, because American Truck Simulator devs SCS Software have sneakily revealed Oklahoma as the game’s next DLC. A store page for the Oklahoma expansion has popped up on Steam, although there hasn’t been an official announcement just yet. That’s most likely because today sees the launch of American Truck Simulator’s Texas DLC, so you expect to hear more about Oklahoma after that&#x27;s out of the way.

Well, the game’s slipped out of its 2023 release window and into the distant reaches of 2024, devs Pearl Abyss have revealed. DokeV.Club report that Pearl Abyss CEO Heo Jin-young acknowledged that the game would overshoot 2023 during the company’s earnings conference call last week. Pearl Abyss also delayed their upcoming action adventure Crimson Desert.

We can expect them to arrive in Overwatch 2 when Season 3 of the game begins in early February 2023.

                              <span>It’s late evening. A family is dozing in front of the TV, their dog at their feet. Suddenly the TV turns to static, the ground shakes. While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.
Somerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.

                              <span>NieR gets ready to breach and clear
The NieR series has crossed over into the worlds of PUBG, Soulcalibur, and Final Fantasy XIV. And now, NieR also joins the cameo ranks of Ubisoft&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege.
Ubisoft revealed today that a NieR cosmetic bundle is making its way into Rainbow Six Siege, arriving on November 21. The bundle isn&#x27;t the only one on the way, either. A stinger at the end teases more to come, with 2B&#x27;s boots and this tagline: &quot;A YoRHa soldier is approaching... Glory to mankind!&quot;
Looks like we&#x27;ll learn more on November 21, when Ubisoft reveals the entirety of its next season, Operation Solar Raid. There, according to Ubisoft, we&#x27;ll get more &quot;NieR goodness&quot; for Siege.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;D13DlspkIvE
NieR and dear to our heart
The bundle shown off today is for Maverick, an Attack operator with a blowtorch. The set looks like it includes a cosmetic skin based off the brother Nier&#x27;s appearance, rather than Papa Nier. I do like the design of the guns, as it&#x27;s reminiscent of the black-and-gold aesthetic of the Shades. Grimoire Weiss is included in the bundle too, seemingly as a weapon charm.
As I mentioned before, this is hardly the first NieR crossover. Both the original NieR and NieR: Automata have crossed over into other games. In some cases, like Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s raid series, they even contain some additional details for fans.
I doubt Rainbow Six Siege will hold any deep lore tidbits, but I can&#x27;t rule it out. It&#x27;s a goofy and enjoyable crossover though, and one that made me fondly reminisce on series director Yoko Taro&#x27;s response in our latest interview with him.

Sharon Tal Yguado, a media executive who has formerly worked for companies Amazon and FOX on a variety of smash-hit network shows, has announced the opening of new game development studio Astrid Entertainment.
The remotely-operated studio is yet to announce its workforce, but has seemingly already entered pre-production on its first release — believed to be a multiplayer-centric title. Tal Yguado has already successfully secured a &quot;seven-figure pre-seed investment&quot; from a party of powerful investors including Netease, Tower 26, and Stardom Ventures, which will be used to get Astrid Entertainment off to something of a major headstart.
&quot;I love developing rich worlds and watching millions of people engage and build communities around them. We are seeing a new generation that wants something different. They enjoy walking into evocative worlds that give them freedom, let them hang out with their friends, explore, discover and create their own stories,&quot; said Tal Yguado in a press statement.
&quot;I am incredibly lucky to have found and partnered with like-minded visionary game developers who are already pushing boundaries in this medium. We can’t wait to announce our incredibly talented gaming leadership team. Soon!&quot;
Tal Yguado, who has previously been named one of the three most influential media executives in Hollywood, has worked a plethora of roles in televisual entertainment, partnering with various networks and having a hand in the production of shows such as The Walking Dead, The Boys, Invincible, Fleabag, Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and The Lord of Rings: Rings of Power.

One of the first big releases of 2023 will be Square Enix&#x27; dimension-hopping adventure Forspoken, which arrives on PC and console platforms in January of the new year — Developer Luminous Productions has released a new video spotlighting the many quests, allies, mysteries, and distractions that await young hero Frey&#x27;s journey into the magically-infused world of Athia.
The amusingly titled &quot;Deep Dive&quot; video, (running just short of four minutes), focuses on the many adventurous aspects of Forspoken that are both directly entwined with the game&#x27;s central narrative or appear as fun little extras and/or mini-games. The video starts off with Athia&#x27;s magnificent Monuments which, once freed of corruption by Frey, will offer up stat-boosting skills and abilities for …</span>

Microsoft has debuted its new Xbox Transparency Report, a bi-annual public document designed to detail all of the black-and-green brand&#x27;s actions in regard to community enforcement, player complaints, banned and suspended accounts, and all other manner of recorded dirty dealings on the Xbox platform.
&quot;With this inaugural Xbox Transparency Report, it is our goal to share with you more about the wide range of actions that the Xbox team takes to moderate content on our platform and create safer experiences,&quot; opens the report. &quot;As an essential part of our growth, we expect this report to evolve over time as we learn, iterate, incorporate feedback, and make improvements.&quot;

The first report, perhaps unsurprisingly, reveals that Xbox has doled out …</span>

                              <span>Bucky enters the fray
A new hero joins the lineup of Marvel&#x27;s Avengers at the end of the month. Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, will arrive in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers on November 29.
The 2.7 update will add the once-frozen warrior to Avengers as a playable hero, alongside the Cloning Lab Omega-Level Threat. Bucky will also have his own chain of missions, which will reward an iconic outfit once completed.
The Winter Soldier will be voiced by Scott Porter, who also lent his voice to Bucky in Lego Marvel&#x27;s Avengers. As for his playstyle, he&#x27;s apparently an &quot;assault-focused hero&quot; who loves to do damage.

The Omega-Level Threat of the Cloning Lab carries on the MODOK storyline. It&#x27;s an endgame encounter meant for a squad of players to tackle, and will require Power Level 175 to enter.
Avengers, assembling
Bucky is the latest hero to join Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, since Jane Foster&#x27;s Thor took the field earlier this year. That brings the total hero count up to 12, if counting the PlayStation-exclusive Spider-Man.
It&#x27;s also been a strange year for Crystal Dynamics, the team behind Marvel&#x27;s Avengers. The studio was recently bought by Embracer Group, alongside Eidos Montreal and Square Enix Montreal. The latter would soon be renamed to Onoma before getting shut down.
Meanwhile, Marvel&#x27;s Avengers is still carrying on. The team says that updates past 2.7 will keep on revising and tuning heroes, as they&#x27;ve been doing with past patches. And Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next installment in the Tomb Raider franchise, too.

Those 64-core and 96-core Zen 4 processors performed phenomenally with Genoa having AVX-512, twelve channels of DDR5-4800 system memory support, higher TDP allowance, and other improvements over prior Milan(X) server processors. The other SKU that AMD sent over for review is the EPYC 9374F as their new 32-core high frequency part. For less than $5k, the EPYC 9374F is a high frequency Zen 4 32-core part with a 320 Watt TDP. Today&#x27;s benchmarks are looking at the EPYC 9374F against the EPYC 9554/9654 and various other AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable processors under Linux.</span>

Trailers, screenshots, and previews of A Little to the Left paint a picture of a tidying game about making things neat – and a cat interferes and cats are nice. That’s not inaccurate, but there’s a lot more going on in Max Inferno’s first game. Presenting you with one-screen scenes of real-life objects like books, batteries, and cleaning products, the game invites you to get organising. The simplest asks are to just make a drawer neat, or straighten some pictures, but it soon becomes more sophisticated, launching into magical realist daydreams of how shadows and stars might be arranged to satisfy some sort of imagined rule set.
And it’s the imaginary nature of the rules that surprises most. Re-assembling a torn picture has a clear and obvious objective, for instance, but what is the right way to line up some pencils? Shortest to longest? Yellowest to purplest? Pointiest to bluntest? There’s no one right answer, so the game will usually accept whatever is your personal intuition – then shock you with the fact that there were other ways of seeing what seemed certain.

Games market research group Newzoo has published its latest report which forecasts a year-on-year decline of 4.3% for the global games market in 2022, following two years of &quot;exceptional&quot; growth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the report (thanks, GamesIndustryBiz), the firm estimates that the entire video game market will generate $184.4 billion in 2022, a reduction on the $196.8 billion forecast Newzoo made earlier in the year.

                              <span>If we&#x27;ve learned anything from Marvel&#x27;s comics and cinematic universe, it&#x27;s that the world is always expanding. New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on preview with Pokémon Scarlet or watch our video about it here. Check out these new details about the first Tera Raid battle, an early-purchase Pikachu, and more after that and then read about Greavard, a new ghost-type dog in the games.

He told The Verge this in a new interview where he also revealed that no part of Microsoft&#x27;s ongoing acquisition of Activision Blizzard is about pulling the rug from underneath PlayStation&#x27;s plans; it&#x27;s just that the two parties can&#x27;t write a contract that says explicitly Call of Duty will be on PlayStation &quot;forever.&quot;

                              <span>MSI&#x27;s RX 6650 XT is a capable graphics card for 1440p gaming, and it&#x27;s down from £380 to £299.99 at Overclockers after a healthy discount. 
It also comes with AMD&#x27;s Raise the Game Bundle, which includes copies of two upcoming games: Dead Island 2 and The Callisto Protocol (confusingly titled &#x27;The Callisto Project&#x27; by a potentially short-sighted Overclockers staffer). This is a pretty solid deal for three hundred of your Great British Pounds, especially as GTX 16-series cards were selling for this much recently and offer far worse performance.

                              <span>It takes a very special game to give you so much to learn, so many ways to do everything, that even after 1000 hours of playtime you still feel like a beginner. Factorio is daunting in the extreme, and I remember bouncing off it the first time I tried. Thank goodness I gave it a second chance. Building up a gigantic world-spanning, atmosphere-destroying factory slowly and methodically over dozens of hours is probably my favourite singleplayer experience in games.

Their reasons for the delay have been detailed in a lengthy Steam post, but it&#x27;s mainly good news: after receiving tons of feedback from their recent demo, the devs are now looking to expand the game&#x27;s scope and spend more time working on its futuristic dirigibles and such. They also released a new teaser trailer showing some customisable airships from the game, too.

The game brings out the worst in me on the regular, as I turn into a spittle slinger who screams into their fist after hitting the tiniest ledge or fighting an awful, awful boss. Frontiers is a janky beast - a mess. Yet, it&#x27;s a lot of fun when you&#x27;re mindlessly collecting stuff and sliding on rails and listening to excellent drum and bass tracks. It&#x27;s a playground of the best and worst kind, so if you&#x27;d like a test of patience with your precious spare time, then you simply can&#x27;t get any better than this.

Gameplay from the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 is due to be shown off in a REDstreams event on Twitch next week, along with some new stuff for the game based on Netflix’s version of Geralt Of Rivia’s adventures.

                              <span>Supporter posts mean I can talk about things that aren&#x27;t PC games - at least that aren&#x27;t PC games yet - and this weekend I used a giftcard to get God Of War Ragnarök, the hacktion-dadventure sequel to the God Of War soft reboot. So far I am finding it, you know, fine, by which I mean it is good and fun but also almost exactly the same as 2018 one, right down to the tension between Kratos and his son Atreus. Their dynamic seems to have largely pressed the reset button so they can do a character growth again, with the differences so far being that Atreus is now taller and his voice has broken, Kratos doesn&#x27;t call him &quot;Boy!&quot;, and also he won&#x27;t shut up under any circumstances.

To gear players up ahead of time, some more details about one of the game’s four classes have been revealed in a new gameplay video. Watch below to find out why you don’t want to mess with the Psyker class.

Modder PureDark is working together with a small team on the unofficial plugin, called Skyrim-Upscaler, and it should help bump up those frame rates somewhat. It&#x27;s available to download now from Github if you want to give it a go yourself, but there’s no plan to release the plugin publicly until the modders sort out VR compatibility.

                              <span>The future has arrived in Monkey Moon&#x27;s new narrative management game, and you can see it all the next time you go and fill up your car. At EyeLife&#x27;s Flat Eye stations, why stop at getting milk and snacks when you can also pick up a whole new stomach, liver and other assorted organs? You&#x27;ll find them on aisle five, right next to the surgery booths. Perhaps you&#x27;d prefer a quick medical checkup instead, though? After all, your tailored biometric predictions for the day looked a bit dodgy earlier, and goodness knows you&#x27;re not going to wait to see an actual doctor about it.
Afterwards, why not escape for a bit and treat yourself to an immersive VR experience? They&#x27;ve got everything from hour-long fantasies to ones that last days, or even weeks. Your choice. And if you&#x27;re short on time, you could always just give yourself those happy memories by sitting in their mind-altering MemoryMachines for a couple of minutes. Just don&#x27;t forget to steer clear of the big recycle chambers. I heard something terrible happened to a dog who wandered into one recently, and the owner went absolutely ballistic. And watch out for the GentleSleep pods, too. I&#x27;ve only ever seen the clerk take long black sacks out of there and stick them in the incinerator, and the smell was awful.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 3 is arguably the single most interesting thing to emerge from the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 GPU launches. Even with, I’ll concede, some limits: whereas previous DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) versions have been available to any GeForce RTX graphics card, DLSS 3 is currently only usable on these RTX 40 series models. Or will be, once the RTX 4080 goes on sale on November 16th. Yet having tested it out on the RTX 4090, I’m convinced it could be as big a deal as the cards themselves, especially if you have a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor.

Managing the last group of people alive on whatever world they inhabit has me questioning my every decision like I’m cutting wires underneath a bomb.
It’s a relief then, that Floodland is a bit more chill than some of its city-building contemporaries. Gone are the humanity-ending threats like Frostpunk’s great Winter storm, forever bearing down on you and periodically tightening its grasp around your neck. Here you have a simple group of stranded civilians looking to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flood.

                              <span>Crucial&#x27;s rather excellent value SATA DRAM-less QLC SSD, the BX500, is down to £56 on Amazon UK from an RRP of £74. I feel that&#x27;s a decent savings on a drive ideal for upgrading an older machine or as media/game storage in a new one, where money spent per gigabyte is the primary measurement of a drive&#x27;s suitability. (If performance is the objective, then a faster NVMe SSD drive is the way to go.) And by that measure, this drive is almost off the scale, with a cost of just 5.6p per gigabyte.

CD Projekt Red has revealed that the new-gen update, or &quot;next-gen update&quot; as the studio calls it, for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, will be released on December 14.

This update will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and it will be free to everyone who already owns the game.

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

                              <span>Brazil says blocking measures to tackle the rise of pirate IPTV services and devices are coming soon. In the meantime, a new system of fines will apply to suppliers and users alike. The government has other plans which appear to render all TV boxes illegal by default, pending official approval. And if anyone modifies an approved device or &quot;uses it incorrectly&quot;, that&#x27;s an offense too.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are getting increasingly affordable, with this week bringing rather good prices on the lowest-tier Ryzen 5 5500. This is, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest Ryzen CPU in the lineup, but still quite a capable chip with power that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the old Ryzen 5 3600. This processor normally retails for £110, but today you can pick one up for £88 when you use code BAG20OFF.

                              <span>A federal court in Seattle has dismissed the hacking and DMCA circumvention claims filed by AimJunkies against game developer Bungie. The cheat seller filed the claim in a retaliatory move after it was sued for copyright infringement relating to Destiny 2 hacks. The order is a clear win for Bungie, but the legal dispute is not over yet.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel&#x27;s development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

The news broke this morning with BTAS co-star Diane Pershing, who voiced Poison Ivy, posting on Facebook that Conroy had passed yesterday from an illness, later identified as cancer. Warner Bros. has since confirmed the news. 
&quot;Very sad news: our beloved voice of Batman, Kevin Conroy, died yesterday,&quot; Pershing writes. &quot;He&#x27;s been ill for a while but he really put in a lot of time at the cons, to the joy of all of his fans. He will be sorely missed not just by the cast of the series but by his legion of fans all over the world ... RIP, friend.&quot;

                              <span>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a pretty bleak game, but it’s also really good! It’s set in Depression-era America, a time when many folks were having their assess kicked by the economy and manifest destiny. The game is about these people, specifically travellers and nomads who wander the country in search of answers. Migrant workers, preachers, poets, folk healers, Dustbowl refugees, and even men with wolf’s heads make up this cast, and it’s your job to meet these strangers and collect their stories.

                              <span>Dave the Diver (character) is a bit out of practice, but he&#x27;s an easygoing sort and it doesn&#x27;t take much to convince him to get back in his flippers to look into the local anomaly at the behest of his arms dealer &quot;friend&quot;, who would be clearly bad news even if his name wasn&#x27;t Cobra.
Said anomaly fills with new sea creatures from all over the world every time it&#x27;s visited, and possibly building-sized terror beasts and ancient merfolk, but Cobra&#x27;s sure it&#x27;ll all be fine, so in you go, mate. It&#x27;s certainly pretty down there if nothing else, and Dave the Diver (game) is, if nothing else, a rare game that makes the usually tedious water level a bit of a treat to wander round in.

                              <span>Obviously, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe in the pleasurable side of PC hardware. Building a PC (or even just swapping out a component) can be a series of lovely little tactile moments: the peeling-off of plastic wrapping, the K’nex-like click of a graphics card slotting into place, the soft whoosh of the fans on a first successful boot. Great stuff, and of course, that’s all before games start coming out of it. What’s not to like?
Oh, reader, so many things. So many, many things not to like. Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost. Namely, time spent dealing with arcane troubleshooting practices and the occasional spot of minor personal injury.

                              <span>Being a Dragonborn in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim might have its privileges and accompanying superhuman abilities, but precognitive avoidance of incoming projectiles does not rank among them. Until now, thanks to a Special Edition mod that slows down time when arrows are flying towards your mightily voiced fantasy warrior. Enabling the Projectile Sense – Incoming Arrow &amp; Magic Slows Time mod should give you just enough advance warning to hotfoot it out of the path of any pointy ended sticks that have been loosed and are heading your way.

And I was like, &quot;Sure!&quot; and toddled off to have a look. I was delighted! But I think Katharine was anticipating it would arouse a different emotional response in me to what it actually did, because she used the word &quot;horrifying&quot;.

They’re targeting the subscription service market, together with the start of Battlefield 2042’s upcoming Season 3: Escalation in December, bringing the game to both EA Play and Microsoft’s Game Pass Ultimate. Of course, EA Play is included in regular PC Game Pass, so there&#x27;s that. You can find out more by watching the development update video below.

                              <span>Harvestella is a JRPG. This may seem like an incredibly obvious thing to say about a role-playing game from Square-Enix, but it’s the most important thing to know going in. Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.
Anyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been eagerly anticipating Pepper Grinder since I saw a series of tweets with GIFs several years ago. It&#x27;s a pixel platformer in which the protagonist, Pepper, has a drill which she uses to plow through scenery, and a grappling hook for all the moments when she&#x27;s not underground. It&#x27;s now been officially announced with Devolver as publisher and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

It&#x27;s a gorgeous Commandos-style stealth-and-stab &#x27;em up set during Edo period Japan. It&#x27;s also currently free via the Epic Games Store.

Two Point Studios announced today that they have grander plans for their collegiate follow-up Two Point Campus. They&#x27;re working on adding modding to the game, and it will include being able to add and amend in-game items.

                              <span>It&#x27;s easy to place Dark Souls 2 in your crosshairs and take aim at its differences. Its map doesn&#x27;t intertwine like Dark Souls 1 or 3. Lots of bosses do that thing where they summon in some mates and it&#x27;s quite annoying. The atmosphere lacked that magic glaze. And yet, its quirks and frustrations make it one of my favourites.

                              <span>I toyed around with this intro a lot, because I didn’t want to start with a super pessimistic bang. But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.
At least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.

                              <span>Lunistice is a 3D platformer inspired by the PSX/Sega Saturn era, but its high-speed movement reminds me of Sonic’s 3D adventures, in a good way. Out today on PC and Switch, it was originally developed by solo dev A Grumpy Fox as a small 30-day project, but it quickly ballooned into something larger. It&#x27;s now been over a year since A Grumpy Fox first started work on the game, but I think you can agree from the announcement trailer below, it&#x27;s been time well spent.

                              <span>You know who&#x27;s cool? You, obviously, for listening to the Electronic Wireless Show podcast. This week we&#x27;re talking about games that make us feel like proper cool people, just like you - who, I emphasise again, are a very cool person. Matthew is not cool enough to be here this week, but I am joined by Nate, who is the king of cool (and crabs).
There&#x27;s a Cavern Of Lies to test Nate&#x27;s coolness, and we check in with Henry &quot;The Vit&quot; Cavill, but first, of course, we must litigate the different kinds of cool we feel, what counts as cool, and which games make us feel the coolest.

                              <span>Halo Infinite’s Forge mode has only been out for a day as part of the winter update, but fans have already created some seriously impressive stuff. Players have forged remakes of classic Halo maps and entirely new designs that give us a peek at what’s possible in the engine. If you’re unfamiliar, Forge is a long-time Halo feature that allows players to create and edit their own maps and modes, leading to some of the most fun experiences in the franchise. Let’s take a look at the community’s creativity.

All three games will take place in Earthlock’s fantasy universe, starting with Ikonei Island: An Earthlock Adventure, a crafting spin-off that&#x27;s currently in early access. Jagex will also support the existing Earthlock along with development of the previously announced sequel, Earthlock 2.

                              <span>I’m of the strong and perhaps completely nonsensical opinion that any game is better when it’s set on an island. School me in the comments, please do, but I suspect that Escape Academy: Escape From Anti-Escape Island, new DLC launching for the puzzle game today, might lend my claim some extra weight. That could always be the baggage plummeting from the sky over Anti-Escape Island though, where a summer vacation for the students of Escape Academy has gone very, very wrong. Check out the trailer below.

Alongside them are Ngola Nzinga of Ndongo, and someone wearing a ruff that I’m going to have to assume is either Queen Elizabeth I or Mary, Queen of Scots, because That Hair.

                              <span>Last night’s Nintendo Indie showcase gave us fresh looks at many exciting indies. Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

Still, it’s one to take with a pinch of salt, which probably wards off the undead too. There’s been no word from devs Arkane on whether rumblings of a Redfall beta are legit yet, but The Game Awards are only a few weeks away so we might see something announced there.

                              <span>Say what you will about Square Enix&#x27;s ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix&#x27;s enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you&#x27;re a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it&#x27;s your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that&#x27;s more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony&#x27;s long-dead handheld, where it&#x27;s lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I&#x27;ll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

                              <span>Activision have laid out their Season 1 roadmap for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 along with the upcoming Warzone 2.0, which launches on November 16th. As that’s less than a week away now, it’s a good job there’s loads of info about everything, from the game’s battle pass overhaul to the incoming story-based DMZ extraction mode.

                              <span>Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series&#x27; premise and new heroes. 
The story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. 


First announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. 
Though steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.</span>

Beyond our coverage of Street Fighter 6 in the latest issue of Game Informer, issue 351 also includes a deep dive into Tchia, and the unusual trip where we learned more about the game.  
Tchia is created by the development studio known as Awaceb. Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  
Check out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.
Our video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  


Tchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC.

                              <span>We recently traveled to Osaka, Japan, for our Street Fighter 6 cover story. While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.
It&#x27;s impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game. Check out the photos from our time at Super Nintendo World to get a sense of how incredible the experience is.

                              <span>With Stadia’s impending shutdown in January, Google has begun fulfilling its promise of issuing refunds to its customers. The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. 
As previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:
Stadia Controller
Founder&#x27;s Edition
Premiere Edition
Play and Watch with Google TV packages
Stadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. 
Refunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.
Users may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There&#x27;s no way of knowing when you&#x27;ll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.</span>

                              <span>Intel včera představil procesory Max Series Xeon a Max Series Data Center GPU. Oba produkty cílí na výkonné servery. V Max Series Xeonu jsou poprvé použity HBM paměti, které se dříve používaly jen pro GPU. Nový Xeon má mít až 56 výkonných jader, 64 GB HBM paměti a příkon pod 350 W.  Rychlou HBM paměť je možno využívat samostatně, nebo se chová jako vyrovnávací paměť pro pomalejší DDR5. Při srovnání s AMD EPYC 7773× Intel uvádí až 4× vyšší výkon.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we&#x27;ve looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLEDs are brilliant gaming displays at any size - and the 42-in and 48-in models are just small enough to fit onto an average to large-sized desk. That technically makes them &quot;cool gaming monitors&quot; and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton &amp; Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon (&quot;FLASH25&quot;) that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we&#x27;ve ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

                              <span>Composer Mick Gordon has published a rebuttal to an open letter by id Software executive producer Marty Stratton concerning Doom Eternal&#x27;s soundtrack. Stratton&#x27;s post was written all the way back in May 2020, and Gordon&#x27;s response is a doozy. “Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the DOOM Eternal Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure,” Gordon said in the post on Medium. Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

                              <span>Just over two weeks ago I predicted the ZA/uM situation would only get messier, so slap my face and call me Mystic Meg. Disco Elysium&#x27;s game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have, at least partially, offered up their side of the story on why they were fired from Disco dev studio ZA/UM in a Medium post titled &#x27;TO FANS OF DISCO ELYSIUM, CONCERNING THE SITUATION AT ZA/UM&#x27;. Short answer is: they allege fraud.

It resides in the Goldilocks Zone of creepiness: just the right amount of creepy to be considered cool, and not quite creepy enough to cause nightmares. There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

The Company Formerly Known As Facebook broke the bad news to employees via a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared earlier today. The job losses equate to 13% of Meta’s entire staff. Redundancies will affect staff across Meta’s global offices, including here in the UK.

                              <span>I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

The fantasy action RPG’s multiplayer was scuppered earlier this year when a security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing online was discovered all the way back in January. PC servers for Remastered were taken offline until a fix could be found, along with every other Dark Souls game.

They’re also touting more frequent updates to an FPS game that’s been relatively Spartan in terms of content, so far. Another game update is planned for later in 2022, which means Halo Infinite players can almost certainly expect something in December.

                              <span>An impressive video showing Titanfall 2-esque movement and mechs inside Team Fortress 2 makes me mighty excited for the future of mods in Valve&#x27;s multiplayer shooter. Valve are currently testing new expanded modding features in TF2, letting modders play with the VScript feature supported by games including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Left 4 Dead 2. While it&#x27;s not yet clear what will happen, a proof-of-concept video mashing in wallrunning, swish grappling hooks, and pilotable mechs suggests great potential. Come watch!

Korean site MTN claim Sony are teaming up with Guild Wars publishers NCsoft to create a massively multiplayer take on Guerilla Games’ sci-fi action RPG. This partnership to create new games isn’t just limited to Horizon either, MTN’s source alleges.

The intention to conduct an in-depth investigation was announced in a statement on the European Commission’s website, and will focus on how the deal will affect console and PC games, along with PC operating systems. This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

                              <span>Dueling content director hosts, Brian Shea and Kyle Hilliard, take a look at Sonic Frontiers in the latest episode of New Gameplay Today and discuss why it is one of Sonic&#x27;s best efforts in years.
Brian and Kyle talk about where the game excels, where it has shortcomings, and look at it on two different platforms: Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. You can read Brian&#x27;s full Sonic Frontiers review right here.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

That&#x27;s right: Our next issue proudly features Street Fighter 6 on the cover. The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

This new look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was mostly focused on Ed Sheeran’s new Pokémon single “Celestial,” but it also included a few Big Nuggets of information we learned for the first time. The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.
Game Informer: What happened in Scorn?

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience. Though each side of the coin has faults, Frontiers is an overall positive experience that serves as a boost in the right direction for the franchise.
Running through the open zones is often a joyful experience. …</span>

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you&#x27;re interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
