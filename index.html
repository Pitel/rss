                              <span>In Shakespeare&#x27;s Anthony And Cleopatra, said famous woman says &quot;Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt.&quot; I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.
This is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA&#x27;s CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that&#x27;s the &quot;you&#x27;re about to be unemployed&quot; language right there. The company is moving away from &quot;the development of future licensed IP&quot; and toward &quot;our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities&quot;. Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer&#x27;s count) must go.

But we weren&#x27;t expecting to see new additions quite so quickly, as rideable mechs have been spotted in the wilds. When are they actually being added to the game? No idea. Do they look cool as heck? Yes, absolutely.

Need apples for cider? Fly through the trees, cannons ablazing. Need to gather wheat? Fly the plane through the field using its propeller as a scythe, with hardier types of wheat requiring tougher propeller blades. Need to haul up scavenge from the ocean floor? Use the plane&#x27;s sea anchor as a rudimentary fishing claw. Need to open a box you found on the beach? The plane&#x27;s the thing, etcetera.

We were treated to the surprise release of Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway last week during the February 2024 Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase and now Evening Star has dropped yet another way to keep us thinking about the 3D platformer at all costs.
Tee Lopes&#x27; vibe-filed score for Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available to stream on just about every platform. You can listen to the 46-track soundtrack on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music and more. Heck, if you listen to music on it, it&#x27;s probably there. You can find links to each available streaming platform on the Kid Katana Records website.

Remember when we highlighted the delightful efforts by @KeshiCorner in preserving Zelda history by 3D scanning a bunch of rare figures from the 1980s? Well, they&#x27;re back at it again with another set of awesome figures from Bandai that would have otherwise remained lost in the relentless passage of time.
This time around, we&#x27;re looking at a complete set of keshi rubber figures from Bandai based on the Super Mario Bros. franchise. These things are about as rare as they come, but thanks to KeshiCorner, they have now been preserved via 3D scanning and can be accessed via the Internet Archive.

If you&#x27;ve been waiting for a hard copy of Dave The Diver, you&#x27;re in luck... kind of. Arc System Works has today announced a physical &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; of the game for Switch will be launching on 30th May 2024.
As part of this collab, the game will add some content from the fighting game Guilty Gear Strive. This includes themed graphics for the boat and customers who wear themed costumes. There&#x27;s also a rhythm game giving you access to the song &quot;The Disaster of Passion&quot;. It&#x27;s worth mentioning how this isn&#x27;t Dave&#x27;s first collab, as he&#x27;s previously teamed up with Godzilla and games like Dredge.

                              <span>Both Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth inexplicably feature Segway-inspired scooters. We don&#x27;t know why this happened, or if developers at Square Enix and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio were in communication, or if scooters happen to be really popular in Japan right now ‚Äì we don&#x27;t know. One question we can answer, however, is which one is better?
Join Marcus Stewart and me as we put the two Segway-inspired scooters to the test side-by-side across a series of competitions and stunts to see which two-wheeled balancing vehicle is the best.

CEO Andrew Wilson issued a company-wide letter informing staff of the publisher&#x27;s restructuring, which will mean sunsetting some live service titles and ceasing the development of certain projects.
In his letter, Wilson states that EA is restructuring to become more streamlined in order to deliver &quot;deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere that build community, shape culture, and grow fandom.&quot; To that end, the company will be moving away from licensed IPs and shutting down certain titles to shift its development resources.¬†

                              <span>When will it end? According to GamesIndustry.biz, Electronic Arts announced today that it will be laying off approximately 5% of its workforce which equates to around 670 people. In a note sent out to EA staff, CEO Andrew Wilson indicated the move is part of the company &quot;moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.&quot;


Another sweeping layoff in our decimated industry


The moves are part of a larger restructuring plan at EA which includes the closing of some offices and sunsetting of several live games. According to GameIndustry.biz, major external IP games based on Black Panther and Iron Man remain in development.


This is the second time in the last year that EA has performed restructuring plans resulting in hundreds of layoffs after EA cut 6% of staff in March 2023.


Literally one day ago, Sony announced it was cutting almost 1,000 jobs by cutting its workforce by 8%.


We&#x27;re not even a quarter of the way into 2024 and over 7,000 jobs have been lost in the games industry just these last two months. This is immediately after an equally brutal 2023 where over 10,000 jobs were lost. At this point, we&#x27;re looking at an industry that will take years to recover as that amount of jobs will not be created overnight, though they seemingly have been eliminated that quickly.

                              <span>Very, very few games have managed to nail the gist and feel of Half-Life so compellingly as ADACA has. The really interesting bit, though, is that this little-known low-poly first-person shooter - arguably Half-Life‚Äôs best copycat - has just received its Episode Three, believe it or not.


It‚Äôs fairly apparent that neither Half-Life 2: Episode 3 nor Half-Life 3 proper are on the horizon right now. While Half-Life: Alyx and the wide variety of mods and bonus materials from Valve are a good way to keep the general vibe of the franchise alive, ADACA accomplishes a similar job while still successfully eking out its own dedicated niche. The fact that it‚Äôs just received its very own Episode Three is quite funny in its own right, on top of being a compelling piece of new content.

F1 23 was received well by critics, scoring itself an 82 on Metacritic as of February 28. Time will tell whether this year&#x27;s release has enough to differentiate itself from its predecessor.

Prizes for pre-orders


EA has provided you with plenty of incentives to pre-order the upcoming racing game. This is especially true of the Champions Edition which, if pre-ordered before April 24 by F1 23 players, will let you enjoy Time Trial challenges using the new Alpine, Haas, McLaren, and Williams 2024 team cars.


The digital-exclusive Champions Edition is one for the fans, and it comes with two new F1 icons ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Though Helldivers 2 has been a hit, its launch has been anything but smooth. Various bugs, glitches, and server issues forced Arrowhead Games to temporarily cap the possible number of concurrent players.


One of the bugs causing an uproar is the disappearing Super Credits glitch. Super Credits are a form of in-game currency used to purchase useful items in the Superstore. You can acquire Super Credits by completing missions or by simply buying them using real-world cash.


Some players who have purchased Super Credits complained that their cash is disappearing. This significant glitch leaves players feeling like they wasted their money and got nothing in return. The problem affects players purchasing Super Credits on PSN and those who bought the Steeled Veteran Warbond with Super Credits.‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>NetEase has announced its latest AAA studio, BulletFarm, with Call of Duty veteran David Vonderhaar at the helm. BulletFarm is a brand new game development company working on &quot;building a world-class team.&quot; Though the studio is based in Los Angeles, California, it is remote-first. 


BulletFarm game will have an emphasis on co-op


It&#x27;s far too early for any kind of official game announcement, but BulletFarm offered some clues as to what it&#x27;s working on. Most notably is its &quot;emphasis on co-operative gameplay.&quot; Like Call of Duty, that could mean multiple game modes in co-op, multiplayer, and a campaign option, but only time will tell. 


While it&#x27;s light on other details, we at least know this is a brand new IP with first-person perspective. The Vonderhaar-led studio says it is building an &quot;‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>After some time in development and testing, the Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode update is here to Spirit Bomb the lag away. Those hoping to play some online matches without the delay-based netcode can start doing so, for certain platforms.


The Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode patch will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. However, devices like the PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch will still only feature a delay-based netcode mechanic. The Circle Party and Party Battle modes will also be limited to the delay-based netcode.


Rollback will go live for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on February 29, when those consoles&#x27; versions go live. It&#x27;s also headed to PC at the same time.


As for what the update actually does, it seeks to fix input lag and visual stuttering for compatible online matches through rollback netcode, resulting in much smoother gameplay. Bandai Namco mentions that it &quot;feels closer to offline play&quot; due to its quicker response system.

Unlike consoles, PC will get the option to choose between the rollback or delay-based netcode, depending on the matchmaking performance. Save data transfers are available as well, for those who want to make the switch to a newer console and its netcode.


Many online games have issued out rollback netcode updates in the past, to better the performance of online play. The system has been gradually adopted across fighting games as a preferable option for handling bouts over long distances, using predictive options rather than hitching the action. We&#x27;ve seen the likes of Samurai Shodown and Street Fighter 6 adopt rollback, to help with online lag. And now, Dragon Ball FighterZ has joined the rollback club.


Dragon Ball FighterZ unfortunately continues to not have cross-play functionality. But hopefully, rollback netcode will be a good move for keeping the online bouts of DBFZ going strong.

                              <span>Today, nearly five years after Control first launched, Remedy has announced it&#x27;s fully acquired the rights to the franchise. The studio has acquired full rights from publisher 505 Games, for roughly ‚Ç¨17M.


While Remedy Entertainment previously developed the game with 505 Games having publishing, distribution, and marketing rights over¬†Control, this latest transaction converts this authority to Remedy, giving them full rights over¬†Control, as well as the upcoming Control 2 and the multiplayer game currently under the codename¬†Condor.


According to the announcement, publishing agreements for all three games are &quot;immediately terminated by mutual agreement&quot;, outside 505 Games continuing as Control&#x27;s publisher until December 31, 2024. Publishing, distribution, marketing, and other rights are also completely reverted to Remedy &quot;with immediate effect.&quot; 


Remedy&#x27;s announcement also reveals the maximum purchase price of this exchange to be approximately EUR 17 million, equaling the amount 505 Games paid for Condor and Control 2&#x27;s development cycle thus far, plus a premium. Remedy will pay the purchase price over the next 12 months.


In doing this, Remedy Entertainment will &quot;be more directly in charge of marketing, distribution and other business-to-business deals&quot;. The post continues to highlight Remedy&#x27;s plans to have complete control over Control and Condor, detailing that the transaction &quot;enables further financing and partnership opportunities which will help us to grow the Control 2 and Condor, as well as the whole Control franchise into an even greater success than before.&quot;

                              <span>3DRealms is known for its many, many retro first-person shooters, and though Wrath: Aeon of Ruin doesn‚Äôt necessarily stand out in this respect, it‚Äôs a marquee example of the niche regardless. It‚Äôs pretty exciting, then, that its 1.0 version has now launched from Early Access.


Described as a ‚Äúgreat mixture of old and new‚Äù back in 2019, Wrath: Aeon of Ruin is a strange and enticing combination of the first Quake and Turok, of all things. It‚Äôs a rapid-fire boomer-shooter, not unlike DUSK, but with a bit of additional pizazz added on top. Now, with the 1.0 build available and about, players can enjoy the game‚Äôs full story, a revised encounter design and improved AI, and a wealth of other previously unavailable goodies.

                              <span>In the early hours of this morning, a ransomware group claimed to have hacked into Epic Games, taking personal data, such as names, payment details, and passwords. However, the Fortnite and Unreal studio has since responded to concerns that anyone has gained access to files, saying it&#x27;s investigating but hasn&#x27;t found any evidence so far.


According to the Australian site Cyber Daily, a group calling itself the Mogilevich gang is claiming to have gotten hold of around 189GB of personal information from Epic. Some of the data said to have been stolen include ‚Äúemail, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data.‚Äù


The group is asking someone who works for the company to &quot;buy the data.&quot; While no price has been mentioned, a deadline of March 4 was given, though there was no clue about what would happen if the demand for money wasn&#x27;t met by this date.




No contact made to Epic


In a statement to Eurogamer a few hours ago (plus the above tweet), Epic Games has said it&#x27;s moving fast to investigate these claims.


However, Epic says there is &quot;zero evidence right now that the ransomware claims from Mogilevich are legitimate.&quot; The message goes on to say the studio began investigating &quot;within minutes&quot; of seeing the &quot;screenshot of a darkweb webpage in a Tweet from a third party.&quot;


A recent post on Twitter from Editor-in-Chief of Bleeping Computer Lawrence Abrams says the group is looking for $15K for the allegedly hacked data. However, until Mogilevich contacts Epic, this could well be nothing more than an empty threat. We&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on this story, though.

                              <span>With the long awaited 1.6 update to Stardew Valley finally coming on March 19, fans have taken the opportunity to speculate about what‚Äôs to come, including what a little raccoon on the official image could mean.¬†


Way back in December 2020, update 1.5 brought players a long list of additions, including a new location in Ginger Island. As such, players are currently getting excited at the thought that Update 1.6 could add another new location, Prairie Island.


It‚Äôs worth noting before we go any further that this has not been confirmed by ConcernedApe and, at the moment, is just a fan theory.


Is Prairie Island coming to Stardew Valley?




One Reddit post by u/Russ_Guss_Doodles highlights exactly why fans are speculating that Update 1.6 could see Stardew Valley players head to Prairie Island.


Prairie Island is known to have an abundant population of raccoons, as shown in the &quot;Natural Wonders: Exploring Our Vibrant World&quot; film at the in-game Movie Theatre. Ginger Island was teased within the same movie and, again, was added in Update 1.5.


Back in April 2023, ConcernedApe told fans that they were taking a break to work on 1.6, but that the update wouldn‚Äôt be as comprehensive as 1.5. However, the developer has also admitted that they‚Äôve worked much harder than they originally anticipated on the upcoming patch, so it‚Äôs understandable that players are excited for what‚Äôs to come.¬†




Within the comments on the above tweet, one user asked ConcernedApe about the possibility of a new island and while the developer didn‚Äôt outright answer the question, he did say that 1.6 would be more about ‚Äúadding more to the old stuff‚Äù.


For now, we‚Äôll just have to wait and see what that raccoon really means.

                              <span>Last May, Red Barrels unleashed the nightmare that was The Outlast Trials to Early Access. The third installment (or fourth if you count Whistleblower as a separate entry) in the terrifyingly disturbing horror series leans more towards multiplayer, and version 1.0 is about to drop on y&#x27;all.


Recent updates from the developer show that the next patch is almost here, and rolls out on March 5. This will take Outlast Trials out of Early Access. Along with this, the game will come with a brand-new map: the Toy Factory. There will also be new MK-Challenges, and more.




Also, with the 1.0 update, the game itself is going to be going up in price. This means you have until next Tuesday to get The Outlast Trials a bit cheaper. Oh, and it&#x27;s also available to pre-order for consoles as well, so that&#x27;s nice. Check out the PlayStation and Xbox stores for details.


Pushing the boundaries of taste


Ever since I played the first Outlast back in 2013, I&#x27;ve been intrigued by how far Red Barrels can take things. Horror has always been about scaring people or putting them in unsettling or unfamiliar locations. With this series, it goes that one step further by actually creating something disgusting.


Known for its shocking amounts of detailed gore, disturbing content, and sexual themes, the Outlast games have trodden where other survival horror franchises rarelu dare tread.


I&#x27;ve yet to play Trials, but with version 1.0 around the corner, it might be time to re-enter Murkoff once more, because a perturbing amount of violence of psychopathy is evidently what&#x27;s missing in my life.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t wrong when I said that the release of Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix toolkit would see retro games be given a bit of a spin shine. In this latest example, a modder has taken the original Unreal and injected it with some path tracing and other visual tweaks.


The below video was spotted by DSO Gaming, and shows the 1998 Epic Games release has been given a bit of boost using RTX technology. We see the first level of the classic FPS, as the player shows off the much brighter and bolder colored lighting. Pew pew, indeed.




It should be noted that this is a work in progress, and it&#x27;s still being tinkered with. As a result, you can see a couple of graphical glitches, particularly in the new &quot;shiny&quot; gun. The game was loaded into the Unreal Tournament engine.


This is what first-person shooters used to be like, kids


It would be forgivable for someone unfamiliar with the game to not be able to see what exactly has changed. Fortunately, in response to someone on Twitter, the person behind the mod, Jacob Freeman, uploaded two side-by-side screenshots, which show Unreal with RTX on and off.


It is possible to see a difference, even if it looks like they&#x27;ve just turned the brightness up a bit. As I said, this is still being worked on, so no doubt we&#x27;ll see further progress and improvements.


For those who weren&#x27;t around back then, Unreal was praised for its jump in FPS visuals, utilizing Epic&#x27;s new engine that was named after the game. However, it would soon be left behind when Half-Life came out just a few months later. Valve&#x27;s maiden release essentially stole the spotlight with its genre-shifting development techniques and storytelling methods. Unreal didn&#x27;t stand much of a chance.

                              <span>Developers Cradle Games and Raw Thrills as well as publisher GameMill Entertainment revealed today that the  classic arcade game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants is coming to PC and consoles on April 23, 2024. This expanded version of the arcade beat-em-up marks the first time Wrath of the Mutants is available outside of arcade format.




In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, players can jump into the action solo or local co-op as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, or Michaelangelo. Based on the 2012 Nickelodeon series, Wrath of the Mutants takes place across a variety of environments including Coney Island and Dimension X as players try to defeat the Foot Clan and arch-nemesis Shredder.


All the turtles are voiced by their original voice actors: Seth Green, Sean Astin, Rob Paulsen, and Greg Cipes.


I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I&#x27;ve invested some quarters‚Äîwho am I kidding, dollars‚Äîinto this one at Dave and Busters over the years. It will be tempting to just knock out a few levels from time to time. However, even though local couch co-op is a nice touch, It&#x27;s a bit of a bummer not having the option for online co-op.


Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants launches on April 23, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch for $29.99.

It was probably the company‚Äôs most prolific game series, after all, stretching across several games throughout the ‚Äò90s.


The series never really came to North America, but a few were localized for Europe. The first time we saw it on this side of the ocean was when the first game was released on Wii Virtual Console under its European name, Ufouria: The Saga. That was, unfortunately, locked at running at the PAL‚Äôs 50hz, which made it run faster on modern displays.


For the rest of the games of the series, they strangely never returned to the original formula of quasi-Metroidvania. The series went through racing, puzzle solving, and even arena fighting, ‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Star Wars has always been big news, but now it‚Äôs just one of the many blobs that are trying to slather themselves over every inch of the media landscape and suck the time right out of us. A long time ago, it used to feel like it belonged to the fans.


Before the prequel trilogy started production, it seemed like no one was really sure what to do with the license. There were novels, comic books, and video games; things that the mainstream largely ignored. It became something more for nerds (like myself) who would delve into the lore. New entries felt as though they were made for that audience. It was very disciplined and gentle, as Star Wars was such a precious thing. Though, it was still very messy at times.


1995‚Äôs Star Wars: Dark Forces is slightly more blunt with its handling, but it‚Äô‚Ä¶</span>

The studio&#x27;s announcement was issued on the heels of others today, like PlayStation, and yesterday with developer Supermassive.


According to an announcement from Deck Nine Games&#x27; official Twitter, 20 percent of their staff were let go due to the &quot;worsening market conditions.&quot; This isn&#x27;t the first time the studio has gone through something like this, either. In 2023, Deck Nine laid off 30 employees, with others still at the company reporting some team leads at the studio offered up their own jobs to save other staff.

Taking place over multiple continents on the Planet (or Gaia as it was retroacively called) with various party members, a bunch of open-world areas, and lots of side activities and minigames to partake in, you&#x27;re going to be playing this game for at least 50 to 60 hours before you roll credits (I reached the ending at 80 hours).¬†
When you&#x27;ve seen the story through, you might not be ready to hang up the ole&#x27; Buster Sword. Fortunately, Rebirth has New Game Plus. Well, kinda ‚Äì it&#x27;s complicated.¬†
Here&#x27;s How New Game Plus Works In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth
After you beat the game, you&#x27;ll be prompted to make a save file (heads up, you can only make 10).‚Ä¶</span>

However, regardless of whether you&#x27;re a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen&#x27;s Blood.¬†
Introduced early in Rebirth, Queen&#x27;s Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia&#x27;s various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere. And after spending dozens of hours playing it, I can understand why - it rules. It&#x27;s easily my favorite game-within-a-game ever, and one I hope spins out into its own thing in some form, be it a digital card game, a physical one, or something else.¬†

With multiple open world zones to explore, there are dozens of objectives to complete ranging from Queen&#x27;s Blood matches to treasure caches to combat challenges and more. It&#x27;s safe to say completing everything Rebirth offers will take 100 or more hours, and that&#x27;s before you add in dozens of minigames to the game&#x27;s slew of offerings.¬†

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment, which released Alan Wake 2 to critical acclaim in October, has acquired the full rights to the Control franchise from publisher 505 Games. Released in 2019, Remedy developed Control but it was published by 505 Games, which also had a stake in the franchise&#x27;s rights at the time. Now, after a roughly $18.4 million purchase, the entirety of the Control franchise belongs to Remedy.¬†
This includes the original Control game, its in-development sequel Control 2, the multiplayer spin-off Project Condor, and all future Control products.¬†


&quot;The Control franchise is in the core of Remedy,&quot; the studio writes in a statement released today. &quot;Having acquired the full rights to Control, Condor, and Control 2, Remedy is now in a position to make the right product and business decisio‚Ä¶</span>

I‚Äôm not a poker player. I‚Äôve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men‚Äôs Gambit. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it‚Äôs good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn‚Äôt poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.¬†

                              <span>NetEase Games has pulled back the curtains on its newest studio, BulletFarm. Led by David Vonderhaar, whose experience includes leading the teams behind the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, BulletFarm aims to develop a new triple-A game that utilizes first-person gameplay with an emphasis on co-op in Unreal Engine 5. It will be set in an original universe.¬†
This unannounced and untitled game will &quot;craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay,&quot; according to a press release.¬†
BulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio&#x27;s creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team.¬†

&quot;Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different,&quot; Vonderhaar writes in a press release. &quot;This is a departure from the games I&#x27;ve worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game.&quot;¬†
NetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. &quot;David&#x27;s leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience.&quot;¬†
BulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there&#x27;s no word on when to expect to see it.¬†

While the demise of physical media has seemed like an inevitability for many years now, boutique publishers are helping to keep a passionate base of physical-only fans with a stocked game library. The scenario right now isn&#x27;t ideal, with eShop releases often only getting a physical version months later (once a publisher has gauged interest and calculated an approach that isn&#x27;t going to leave them lumbered with thousands of costly Switch carts in the storeroom) or with orders only open in a limited window.
Decade-old trends have suggested a movement away from physical from the big players ‚Äî why create a secondhand market if you can limit resales and maximise your own profits? ‚Äî although at present Nintendo seems content with the status quo. Microsoft is occupied with Game Pass and Sony&#x27;s number of first-party releases pales in comparison to Nintendo, quantity-wise, so right now it&#x27;s easy to imagine things just staying the same for the next generation ‚Äî all the big games will still be available in physical form, if that&#x27;s how you want them.

                              <span>You can&#x27;t DLC me.
It&#x27;s time for the next DLC fighter to join Mortal Kombat 1 and with that comes another update.
DC&#x27;s Peacemaker (sharing the likeness and voice talents of John Cena) enters &quot;early access&quot; in the game today before his full release on 6th March. Janet Cage&#x27;s Kameo fighter also enters the fray with today&#x27;s update, though she will not be available until next month too. These additions come alongside a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes too, of course.

This is, for lack of a better descriptor, charming; a rekindling of an IP and a platforming vibe not seen rendered in such authentic fashion for some time. Ufouria: The Saga 2‚Äôs simplicity is to its credit, keeping it real to the source material and the vast catalogue of action platform games that informed much of the Nintendo Entertainment System‚Äôs &#x27;80s rule.
The original Ufouria: The Saga was released for the Famicom in 1991 and on the NES in Europe in 1992. It was Sunsoft‚Äôs bid to create a band of mascots, with the intention of placing the characters in a series of games, each utilising a different genre. Sunsoft made decent headway with this plan. Those who remember the grey import scene of the &#x27;90s might remember Hebereke‚Äôs Popoon for the Super Nintendo, a Puyo Puyo-esque puzzle game that popped with cutesy characters and colourful gelatine blobs.

                              <span>You don&#x27;t say.
During Sega&#x27;s Q&amp;A session for its Q3 financial results (thanks, Nintendo Everything), the firm has finally acknowledged that releasing Sonic Superstars right next to Nintendo&#x27;s own Super Mario Bros. Wonder probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea. Though of course, it doesn&#x27;t mention Nintendo&#x27;s flagship by name.
Sonic Superstars (which costs more than Super Mario Wonder on digital storefronts, by the way) was reasonably well received upon launch and received a solid score of 8/10 from yours truly, but considering the critical acclaim received by Super Mario Wonder (not to mention the hype generated by The Super Mario Bros. Movie earlier in the year), it&#x27;s honestly no surprise that Sega&#x27;s platformer failed to meet expectations.

Batman: Arkham Knight wasn&#x27;t in the best shape when it swooped onto Switch at the end of last year. Fortunately, the game has today received a monster 16GB update, one that&#x27;s guaranteed to fix all of its problems, right? Well...
By the looks of it, Batman Arkham Knight still runs poorly on Switch. The official patch notes for the latest update are yet to be published, but the changes seem to be minimal at best. The black sheep of the Switch&#x27;s Arkham Trilogy collection, Knight&#x27;s visuals still seemingly leave much to be desired, frame drops remain regular and it looks like there are still bugs a-plenty.

                              <span>Rebels&#x27; gun.
Following its stellar remaster work on the likes of Quake, Quake II, and the Turok series, Nightdive Studios is back with another glimpse into the world of retro first-person shooters. This time, we‚Äôre heading into the Star Wars universe with Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster, an intriguing game in more ways than one. On the one hand, it offers a look at one of the many, many so-called ‚ÄòDoom clones‚Äô that emerged after the immense success of id Software‚Äôs seminal shooter, and on the other, it represents an era of the Star Wars expanded universe that, in the wider context of the franchise canon, doesn‚Äôt exist anymore.
To call 1995&#x27;s Dark Forces a mere clone of Doom, however, would be to do it a disservice. Yes, the game owes Doom a debt of gratitude, but given LucasArts‚Äô prowess in the adventure genre, the developers were able to elevate Dark Forces to new heights, incorporating story elements via cutscenes and mission briefs, while ensuring that the gameplay wasn‚Äôt simply a case of ‚Äògo here, shoot that‚Äô. It features actual objectives which, at the time, were a refreshing change of pace and allowed for more player agency. You weren‚Äôt simply infiltrating an Imperial stronghold for the fun of it; you were doing it to further the rebellion‚Äôs cause. For the galaxy, for goodness&#x27; sake.

Based on the 2015 award-winning indie film of the same name (for which you can find the trailer here), Turbo Kid will see you exploring an apocalyptic wasteland, armed with a series of increasingly powerful weapons and your trusty BMX.

We are rapidly approaching the release of MLB The Show 24 on 19th March. Before we step up to the plate, however, Nintendo has shared a first look at how the next entry in the baseball series runs on Switch in an all-new gameplay trailer.
At only 30 seconds in length, there&#x27;s not all that much to sink your teeth into here. That said, the focus of the trailer is all about the Switch, so it does give a pretty good idea of what the field will look like on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid next month.

It&#x27;s only been a few days since Atlus officially revealed Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, but it&#x27;s back now with another look at the upcoming game, scheduled to launch on 21st June, 2024.
Okay, granted, it&#x27;s not a massive new look, but the debut trailer has been extended, adding over a minute onto the overall runtime. We&#x27;ll take what we can get, right?

The Pok√©mon Company yesterday announced a new entry in the &#x27;Legends&#x27; line and technically the clock is now ticking. If you haven&#x27;t already completed the original Switch entry Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus, you might want to start.
You&#x27;ve got until some point in 2025 and while we don&#x27;t know if Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A will necessarily connect to the previous game, it&#x27;s probably best to bump Arceus off your backlog before you&#x27;re too busy catching &#x27;em all in this new title.

The video game industry layoffs continue with Sony&#x27;s gaming division PlayStation this week announcing it would be axing &quot;about 8% or about 900 people&quot; across its workforce as part of an organisational restructure.

Nintendo has always had an incredibly strong stance against video game piracy and it&#x27;s now taking legal action against the creators of the Switch emulator Yuzu.
As highlighted by Stephen Totilo of Game File, the Japanese video game giant known for hits like Super Mario and Zelda accuses the Yuzu creators of &quot;unlawfully&quot; circumventing Nintendo software encryption and facilitating piracy.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that cosmetics unlocked by challenges are better than characters making &#x27;bdbdbdbdbdi&#x27; noises while talking in text. This was a close one but your voices were, regrettably, heard clear. This week, I ask you to choose between two different ways to clear your path of obstacles. What&#x27;s better: enemies stopping respawning after you kill them loads, or removing a card from your deck?

                              <span>Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: &quot;We really just wanted to make a small game&quot;? Of course, there&#x27;s little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.
Having said that, I‚Äôm not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, &quot;something very fast&quot;. Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys&#x27; surreal runaway sim first captured everyone&#x27;s attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game‚Äôs ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.

There might be fun in some of its slower moments, but some of the generally positive, &quot;It&#x27;s actually quite a good game!&quot; takes that I&#x27;ve seen honestly baffle me. The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor. MTV&#x27;s show about people getting duped online was the perfect sailing companion, and perhaps, one of the only reasons I survived my brush with the live service seas.

To make that perhaps a little less daunting, Paradox have launched an optional monthly subscription service that gives you access to all the expansions. They&#x27;ve done this for several of their other grand strategy games before. It starts at ¬£8.50 for one month then offers discounts for longer terms. While I can see niche uses for the option, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to pay for this regularly. Would you?

                              <span>A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio&#x27;s Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it&#x27;s one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).
Crucially, though, not to the point where it&#x27;s best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars&#x27; PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can&#x27;t quite stomach the &#x27;Classic&#x27; and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.

                              <span>By this headline, I really don&#x27;t mean that Warhammer 40k is rubbish. But if you have no idea what it is apart from &quot;thing Henry Cavill got made fun of for enjoying on the Graham Norton Show&quot; or &quot;reason I walk past a bunch of beardy lads taking a vape break outside a small shop with steamed up windows every time I go down Lower Glanmire Road&quot;, PowerWash Simulator&#x27;s latest officially licensed IP tie-in DLC could act like a sort of gateway drug. A first step on the path to buying a bunch of miniatures. It&#x27;s out now, for ¬£6.50/$8/‚Ç¨8 on Steam, and it&#x27;s very fun.

This one makes some heroic adjustments to the shooter&#x27;s generally inoffensive microtransaction system, targetting a technical issue whereby Super Credits and Premium Warbonds would not show up after purchase. Huzzah! Developers Arrowhead have also nuked a rather barmy Helldivers 2 glitch that allowed for unlimited stratagem use with no cooldowns following an AFK kick.

                              <span>Having launched out of almost five years of early access last week and quickly become one of Steam&#x27;s current most-played games, fantasy action-RPG Last Epoch has laid out initial plans for post-1.0. Expect bug fixes and quality-of-live improvements soon, then new challenging fights later. The developers, Eleventh Hour Games say they&#x27;re &quot;going to have a heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content&quot;. But first, yes, more fixes and improvements to the servers which suffered and stumbled.

We gave it a Bestest Best badge when it launched into 1.0, and since then the developers promised more major updates. Patch 1.2 is the latest of the bunch, and when it arrives next week it&#x27;s bringing with it a &quot;consumption/production&quot; window, upgrades to the Blight Post, and lots of balance changes.

It&#x27;s been MIA for several years now (and no wonder, given these are 50 full-sized games being made by several different, and likely very busy, developers), but at long last, Spelunky creator Derek Yu has posted an update on Steam saying the project is finally nearing completion. &quot;We should have a complete game in a few months but are planning for a release in the second half of the year to give us time to do more testing and then marketing,&quot; he said.

                              <span>DarkStone Digital, solo developer of The Mortary Assistant, is making a new horror game based on Paramount&#x27;s Paranormal Activity films. Titled Paranormal Activity: Found Footage, it&#x27;s being published by DreadXP and features some kind of reactive haunt system, with scares dialling up and down based on your actions. DreadXP have shared a teaser consisting of some crackly logos against a backdrop of radio chatter. Given that this is a Paranormal Activity adaptation, it&#x27;s possible the trailer harbours spooky secrets. You may wish to experiment with turning the brightness up and down, playing the video backwards, or watching it again at the next full moon, perhaps while standing in a cemetery loudly declaring that ghosts aren&#x27;t real.

                              <span>Given its zero-tolerance approach to piracy, Nintendo&#x27;s copyright lawsuit targeting the company behind Switch emulator &#x27;Yuzu&#x27; isn&#x27;t a big surprise. While the 41-page complaint throws almost everything at the hugely popular Switch emulation project, Nintendo&#x27;s focus on specific functionality plus knowledge, conduct, and intent, seems to avoid a direct assault on general emulation. It could cover the entire scene with banana peels, however.

                              <span>Unreleased footage of the Apple TV+ hit series &quot;Masters of the Air&quot; appears to have accidentally leaked online. The video track of the eighth episode, which is scheduled to be released next week, showed up on pirate sites as the latest release of another Apple series, &quot;The New Look&quot;. Pirate release groups were swift to fix the &#x27;mistake&#x27; but, now that it&#x27;s out, the leak can&#x27;t be unseen.

                              <span>The Sims 4&#x27;s classic HUD layout has been updated with a new feature in the form of a cart icon. Rather than going through the hassle of closing your game to browse the shop, this mechanic allows you to get exclusive packs in-game during your usual Sims binge season. 


A cart icon can be found near the upper-right corner, near all the traditional icons of Build Mode, Manage Worlds, and the Gallery. While there are some reservations about it from the fanbase, it is nice to have easy access to these goodies.

The only setback is the fact that the entire collection won&#x27;t be right in front of you, as the new cart restricts it down to a select few. Instead, recommendations will be presented, possibly based on your past purchases. 


Besides the HUD element, the new Sims 4 update features a variety of fixes across the base game and expansion packs. For Rent issues have been the primary concern for most Simmers, and now the latest patch seeks to resolve these problems. For example, saving errors and laggy performances in the Residential Rental lots have been adjusted. 


The Sims 4 Seasons&#x27; holiday bug has also been resolved, where the themed panel only popped up with various Sims. But, even with these changes, modding will be heavily impacted, turning all the CC characters into some kind of weird Barbie (not that that&#x27;s an entirely bad thing.) To adjust this, the game&#x27;s Direct Communication Twitter/X suggests removing any mods or CC content for the time being. 




Sims 4&#x27;s newest update arrived just in time for the upcoming Crystal Creations. However, the latest Stuff pack will likely bring about more bugs and errors, so we could see more updates along the way for a better Simming experience.

                              <span>Fans of found-footage frights will soon be able to dig into a new video game take on the Paranormal Activity film series. By &quot;soon&quot; we mean 2026, which is when the &quot;all-new interactive game experience&quot; from the devs behind The Mortuary Assistant is set to launch.


The Paranormal Activity: Found Footage game has DarkStone Digital (The Mortuary Assistant) and DreadXP partnering with Paramount for a release on &quot;multiple gaming platforms.&quot; In a move that&#x27;s fitting for the source material, the devs are aiming for a found-footage style backed by a special &quot;Haunt System.&quot; That boils down to different types of scares depending on how you play and the actions you take throughout the game.


You won&#x27;t get much more than that ‚Äî except, perhaps, a chill up your spine ‚Äî in the logo-centric teaser trailer:




The Paranormal Activity series first kicked off back in 2007 and quickly became a huge hit, spawning a total of seven films over the years. Directed by Oren Peli, the first entry was shot for a cool $15,000 before Paramount picked it up and pumped a little more money into it. With an global box office of around $194 million, you can see why they kept going back to that particular well.¬†


As for how it&#x27;s going to translate to a video game, we have a while to ponder. According to DreadXP co-director and creative director Brian Clarke, the team is taking what they learned with The Mortuary Assistant and &quot;cranking it up with a more reactive and horrifying haunting system.&quot; Hopefully we&#x27;ll find some of that footage soon!

                              <span>After 13 long years, Remedy&#x27;s Alan Wake finally received a sequel, and it has been a success, managing to sell a million units by December 2023. 


Unlike its predecessor, Alan Wake 2 is a survival horror title with a mind-bending narrative and settings that are downright psychedelic at times. The creators of the game answered questions from fans in a Reddit AMA on February 27, and as one might expect, plenty wanted to know more about Initiation 4: We Sing. They got their answers from Nathalie Jankie, Marko Muikku, and John Crossland.


Chucking a musical sequence into a survival horror game is unconventional, but Remedy managed to pull it off, with Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi pulling off their best moves to the sound of the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard. It&#x27;s not just a musical, however,‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Skilled-based matchmaking has been an ongoing topic of conversation in the Call of Duty community for a while. 


For obvious reasons, it&#x27;s a necessity that prevents lower-skilled players from quitting or just having an awful experience. However, it also makes playing any style of Call of Duty, other than &quot;sweaty,&quot; downright impossible for more skilled players. The game&#x27;s servers recently had some serious issues for a day, and part of those problems stopped skilled-based matchmaking (SBMM) from working properly.


When the servers were down, so was skilled-based matchmaking


On February 23, millions of players logged into their Modern Warfare 3 accounts and found a few surprises. Their player level was reset to 1, the Zombies mode wouldn&#x27;t work, and loadouts were disabled. It was a mess t‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>If you haven&#x27;t played Black Mesa, the unofficial (yet wholly endorsed by Valve) remake of Half-Life, it&#x27;s definitely worth checking out. For those of us who have played ‚Äì and enjoyed ‚Äì it, the team responsible for it is teasing a new game that&#x27;s currently in the pipeline.


A video uploaded to YouTube by developer Crowbar Collective (thanks, GamesRadar) gives us just 22 seconds of something the studio is working on. All we get is the company logo followed by a colorful symbol that leaves us non the wiser. And that&#x27;s it.




If you want to keep up-to-date with what the developer is working on, you&#x27;re encouraged to sign up to the mailing list. Suffice it to say, it&#x27;s impossible to know what the project is, but I bet you&#x27;ll have your own theories.


It&#x27;s probably not Half-Life 3


It could be a brand-new IP from Crowbar Collective. However, for all we know, it could be another remake. Perhaps of the sequel or some other classic FPS. Who knows? Not I, that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making.


As for Black Mesa, it was in development for years before it finally came out in an official capacity in 2020. It rebuilds the original Half-Life from the ground up, complete with fresh voice acting.


It also tinkered with the OG a little bit. In order to keep diehard fans on their toes, some parts were tweaked or changed in certain respects. It also improved on the Xen aspect of the game, which some feel was lacking somewhat in Half-Life. Again, worth checking out if you&#x27;re a fan of the original.

                              <span>When the end of the world comes (and it will), I like to imagine that in the midst of all the rubble and chaos, people will still be playing Skyrim. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way that people won&#x27;t tinker with the game and in this instance, we get to see dead technology being revived in order to play TES5.


As spotted by PCGamesN, Reddit user nekomichi recently showed that it&#x27;s possible to run the game in a Steam Deck (so far so normal) using old iPods as controllers. The clip attached to the post shows it working as you would imagine.




Movement itself requires scrolling the click wheel of the one on the right, while the left iPod is being used for turning. While walking forward and fighting seem to work pretty well, turning left and right is a bit of a janky affair.


Not intended for speedruns


This idea is actually based on something nekomichi did in November 2022. A video on YouTube shows them setting up some iPods to control Skyrim via PC. Basically, it involves the installation of RockBox, an open source piece of firmware which allows the iPods to be used as devices over a USB.


Once installed, it becomes a case of assigning each button and wheel to an action in-game. The method used in the video is almost certainly the same that&#x27;s used in the Steam Deck version (what is a Steam Deck if not a portable PC, after all).


They&#x27;ve also tested this on Sleeping Dogs, also running on the Deck. However, they say it works much better with Skyrim. There&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t try this yourself if you happen to have some old iPods flying around. But don&#x27;t expect to be speedrunning through the game.

The game&#x27;s major Eurotrip update is, therefore, particularly eclectic, and bound to thrill players this way or the other.


Notably, the Horizon Festival is now being overtaken by a fleet of European vehicles, from top-tier Bentleys to classic AMG Hammer wagons, and they&#x27;re being joined by lovingly recreated dinosaur props. Indeed, players will now be able to use an assortment of dinosaurs for their custom tracks, adding yet another layer of zaniness to the already wild and wacky Horizon franchise.

                              <span>Pokemon has always diversified the ways you can explore its world, with Pokemon TCG being one of them. During today&#x27;s Pokemon Presents, the company revealed Pokemon Pocket, an upcoming new way to enjoy the trading card game. 


Although Pokemon TCG Online already exists, Pokemon TCG Pocket will introduce new elements that&#x27;ll appeal to players who aren&#x27;t particularly invested in the competitive side of things and take more delight in the artwork of the cards. 


The game will allow you to open digital packs and feel the excitement of discovering what new cards you can add to your collection on your mobile device. On your hunt for your favorite cards, you&#x27;ll also be able to trade with other players also hoping to perfect their collection. 


Experience Pokemon TCG like never before

The upcoming game is being developed via a three-way collaboration with Creatures Inc., the Pokemon Company, and DeNA which a company also involved with Pokemon Masters EX.


According to the CEO of Creatures Inc., Yuji Kitano, care is being taken to show off the cards with effects only available digitally. One of the ways this is being done is through an immersive experience that lets you leap into the illustrations, which should be a blast when applied to full art and rare cards.  




The competitive element of Pokemon TCG hasn&#x27;t been eliminated, and you&#x27;ll still be able to battle with friends. However, Kitano explains that the rules have been streamlined to allow for quick battles. 


We don&#x27;t have details regarding any monetization strategies, though it is revealed that you&#x27;ll be able to open two packs a day for free. It launches in 2024, so TCG fans should prepare for the all-new experience coming soon.

                              <span>After more than two weeks of hammered servers and lengthy queues, Helldivers 2 players and developer Arrowhead have a reason to collectively sigh in relief. Helldivers 2 server issues seem to have finally let up during the weekend, and now the studio is ready to go back to the &quot;original plan&quot; and prep new content.


That&#x27;s not to say that the weekend was quiet, oh no. Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt predicted on X (Twitter) that divers would reach the 800,000 player cap over the weekend. It may have accomplished just that, as more than 450,000 players answered the call of Super Earth on Steam alone. 


On February 25, Pilestedt wrote he was &quot;happy and proud&quot; of the team and that the servers stayed online &quot;without problem.&quot; Pilestedt continued by saying it&#x27;s time for the developer to go back to the &quot;original plan,&quot; and that there are &quot;exciting things&quot; in the works.




Helldiver 604958, going dark


By &quot;exciting things,&quot; we&#x27;re hoping he&#x27;s talking about the mech suits. Mechs were teased at the end of a trailer before the game launched. There&#x27;s no word on when we&#x27;ll get the suits, but the trailer mentioned they would be arriving &quot;soon after launch.&quot; Now that waitlists are hopefully behind us, we may soon see which &#x27;metal boxes with legs and guns&#x27; are best between the Helldivers and Automatons. 


But that&#x27;s not all. Before the February 25 message, Pilestedt teased some possible content that could be on its way. In a reply on X to a post about stealth gameplay, Pilestedt wrote he &quot;used to rock subsonic ammo and suppressor&quot; during playtests. He refused to elaborate before dropping an Eagle Smoke Strike and disappearing. 




Whether you play Helldivers 2 loud and proud or dream of going at it quietly, it looks like all players should have more to look forward to shortly.

                              <span>The Pok√©mon Company aired its official 2024 Pok√©mon Presents presentation today, and it closed it out with some good news. Another Pok√©mon Legends is on the way, dubbed Pok√©mon Legends Z-A, and it&#x27;s currently scheduled for 2025.


Today&#x27;s teaser trailer shows Pikachu running through a blueprinted city, where many different Pok√©mon are hanging out. Eventually, the text reveals the &quot;Urban Redevelopment Plan&quot; for Lumiose City - a central location in the Kalos region, the home of Pok√©mon X and Y.


Pokemon Legends Z-A, as it appears to be called, is a new entry in the Legends series and could be an interesting look at the origins of another beloved locale.




Legends among us


Legends started off with Pok√©mon Legends Arceus in 2022, as an interesting side-branch of the mainline series. Transporting its protagonist back in time to the early days of the Diamond and Pearl region, it was much more focused on catching, collecting, and exploring.


And to its credit, Pok√©mon Legends Arceus was pretty well-received. Now, especially after the troubles that Scarlet and Violet went through, a Legends game might be a good stop-gap for franchise woes.


Importantly, Z-A is not launching until 2025. While it could be an early launch for that year‚ÄîArceus was a January game‚Äîthat still means we&#x27;re now looking at a year without a new Pok√©mon entry, as S/V has wrapped its DLC. Hopefully the gap is a good thing. But it does make me curious about what the Switch&#x27;s holiday lineup will look like for 2024.

There are two separate statements, one from President and CEO Jim Ryan and the other from Head of PlayStation Studios Herman Hulst. Both are full of standard executive-speak, but they provide slightly different insights. For example, Hulst‚Äôs statement clarifies that US groups affected will include, ‚ÄúInsomniac Games, Naughty Dog, as well as our Technology, Creative, and Support teams,‚Äù as well as Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuerrilla and Firesprite.‚Äù


However, Jim Ryan goes further to say, ‚ÄúThere will be impact for employees across all SIE regions ‚Äì Americas, EMEA, Japan, and APAC.‚Äù¬†

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII was released in 1997 on PlayStation. In those days, the NES, despite Nintendo only discontinuing it in 1995, was considered practically ancient. Things aged faster in the ‚Äò90s.


By the time the PlayStation had passed into antiquity in the aughts, the denizens of Web 2.0 became aware of a Famicom/NES demake of Final Fantasy VII. Since Final Fantasy VII was still fondly remembered and the retro gamer identity was reaching its maturity, this was a fascinating topic of conversation. Just hearing about it took your imagination to interesting places.


It was certainly fascinating to me. I didn‚Äôt know enough about the backend of video games to really have an idea for how this was possible; a 3-disc epic on a diminutive cartridge. What radical magic!

                              <span>Here&#x27;s something a little different: a seven-port powered USB hub from Sabrent that makes it easy to connect a huge amount of peripherals and drives to your PC without having to fumble blindly with the back of your PC - or turn one of your laptop&#x27;s USB ports into many many more. It normally goes for ¬£30 to ¬£40, but today you can pick it up for just ¬£19 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done some elementary study of the planet Jupiter for various creative research projects/dead-ends. It&#x27;s probably a symptom of my failings as an astronomer, but I have to say that at no point have I noticed any gigantic, depressed clowns. In new platformer Clown Meat, one such gigantic, depressed clown has swum through Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere, drifted to Earth and kicked off some kind of meatpunk apocalypse, saturating the surrounding countryside with circus-themed abominations.

Such a weak title deserves a much worse game, but this captures the feeling of its late 90s FPS influences as they actually were, and ends up just familiar enough to work, and just original enough to refresh the formula. At times, it&#x27;s a little too accurate, but even with its annoyances dialled up by the pressure of playing it too hard for the sake of review, I&#x27;m impressed with the balancing act it&#x27;s struck.

The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it&#x27;s &quot;mostly changers for modders&quot; that&#x27;ll make it &quot;easier and more powerful to mod&quot;.

                              <span>I seem to be on a highly irritating &quot;refuse to play games as they were intended to be played&quot; spree lately. A couple of weeks ago, it was &quot;I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones&quot;, a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed&#x27;s review. Then it was &quot;I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter&quot;, which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it&#x27;s &quot;I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn&#x27;t one&quot;. Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing. Need I say any more?

Today it&#x27;s Sony&#x27;s turn with the axe: the PlayStation publisher have announced plans to reduce their global workforce by about 8% or 900 people, so as &quot;to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead&quot;, in the words of outgoing president and CEO Jim Ryan.
Several well-known PlayStation studios are affected, including The Last Of Us developer Naughty Dog, Ratchet &amp; Clank developer Insomniac Games, Horizon developer Guerilla Games and PlayStation VR specialists Firesprite. It&#x27;s also proposed that PlayStation close Sony London in their entirety, though the exact scale of the reductions remains to be seen.

With a June release now confirmed for Shadow Of The Erdtree, the long-awaited expansion, director Hidetaka Miyazaki has now hinted that we Tarnished may have missed something. One small secret may yet remain, assuming he&#x27;s not pulling another prank, or maybe not. Honestly, Miyazaki should say it has hundreds of undiscovered things. Keep everyone guessing. Communal Internet knowledge has ruined the mystique of video games.

                              <span>Last night I dreamt I had to review a Dragon Age DLC. I reviewed it poorly. I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.
I&#x27;m worried about Dragon Age. I&#x27;m worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it&#x27;ll end up kind of a mess. But that&#x27;s the pessimism talking. What I&#x27;d like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon&#x27;s (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.

                              <span>As someone who&#x27;s learning Japanese, I crave other methods of language acquisition that don&#x27;t feel like studying. Textbooks, flashcards, even watching Japanese media can all feel a bit too close to being back in a classroom. Shashingo, a game that helps you learn Japanese through taking cute photos, may be the study companion I&#x27;ve craved. And having covered it two years ago when it was first properly shown off, I&#x27;m very happy to see it&#x27;s finally arriving later today.

                              <span>Out of all the Nintendo Direct announcements last week, the one I was most sad to see not get a PC release date was the sequel to the much beloved Metroidvania Ender Lilies. The announcement came as a bit of a surprise, all told, and I was worried I&#x27;d have to consign it to what I&#x27;ve now dubbed my Unicorn Overlord pile of games that are never coming to PC. Happily, publishers Binary Haze Interactive have now confirmed that Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist is, in fact, coming to PC (and other consoles) after all, and that it&#x27;s coming real soon, as its PC early access release has been set for just weeks away on March 25th. Result.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the Palwoods, Pocketpair have revealed a new Palworld update - Steam and Xbox patch v0.1.5.0. This is a larger overhaul, encompassing a juicy mixture of balance and technical tweaks that together make this spring&#x27;s breakout survival game easier to play, less buggy and, dare I say, a little kinder, with various tweaks aimed at making life more liveable both for trainers and Pals. I have run my eye over the changelog at the bottom of this page and picked out a few highlights, like somebody fishing a stray banknote from the laundry.

                              <span>‚ÄúEver since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever‚Äôs trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,‚Äù says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku‚Äôs localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, ‚Äúa challenge in some ways but also means we‚Äôre justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.‚Äù
Sunstrum uses an example from the studio‚Äôs latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. ‚ÄúThe app‚Äôs creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they‚Äôre quick to demand wabi-ishi,‚Äù slang for free premium currency. ‚ÄúThis would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‚Äòapologems‚Äô, and that‚Äôs what we ended up using in the game.‚Äù

                              <span>Renaissance, man.
Listen. We&#x27;ve already reviewed Obsidian&#x27;s superlative Pentiment over on our sister site Pure Xbox, where we gave it an excellent 9/10 score. However, now that we&#x27;ve been given the opportunity to return to 16th-century Bavaria all over again in this fantastic Switch port, we daresay it&#x27;s better ‚Äî worthy of a slight amendment to that scoreline, even. Ahhhhh, now, that&#x27;s much better.
Yes, Pentiment pretty much blew us away when it first arrived back in November of 2022. At its core a very clever and utterly absorbing medieval murder mystery, the hook here comes through a unique style and setting that results in one of the freshest and most original games we&#x27;ve played this gen. In fact, this one ‚Äî previously an Xbox exclusive ‚Äî is a real highlight of Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass service, so it&#x27;s incredibly exciting to see it arrive on Nintendo&#x27;s console in such fine form.

                              <span>Sweet little mystery dungeon.
It‚Äôs nearly guaranteed that during any online discussion about a game of the ‚Äòrogue‚Äô genre, at least one sweaty person will eagerly emerge from the woodwork to say, ‚ÄúWell, ackshually, this game is a roguelite, not a roguelike.‚Äù Eyerolls aside, the distinction isn‚Äôt without merit, though ‚Äòpure‚Äô roguelikes are relatively rare these days despite the popularity of many of their mechanics in modern games. Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island‚Äîthe latest mainline release in the long-running Mystery Dungeon franchise‚Äîis a roguelike, and it unashamedly features all the thrilling randomization and savage brutality that you could expect of one. We‚Äôre happy to report that it executes on its unflinching design brilliantly, providing a tough, engaging, and addictive experience that you won‚Äôt want to miss (if you like roguelikes).
The narrative of Shiren &#x27;6&#x27; follows the titular wanderer and Koppa, a talking ferret who accompanies him on his adventures. The two of them both received visions in a dream about a mysterious treasure lying in the stomach of a powerful beast on Serpentcoil Island, so they head there to see if the legends are true. In a rather interesting twist, we then jump forward to the very end of their adventure, right in the middle of their climactic battle with the monster. Shiren takes a blow to the head during the fight that gives him amnesia and though he and Koppa fight bravely, they‚Äôre eventually overwhelmed by the creature and awaken in a nearby village. Eager for another crack at the beast, and in an attempt to jog his foggy memory, Shiren and Koppa set out again to retrace their steps and, hopefully, succeed.

                              <span>A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.
According to Bloomberg‚Äôs Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here.¬†
NEW: As part of today&#x27;s mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.
https://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe
February 27, 2024
Twisted Metal was PlayStation‚Äôs original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock‚Äôs well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season.¬†
The number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood &amp; Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely.¬†PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it&#x27;s among several titles getting the axe.¬†

                              <span>A video game based on the Paranormal Activity film franchise has been announced. Developed by Darkstone Digital, makers of the 2022 horror game The Mortuary Assistant, along with publisher DreadXP and Paramount Pictures, the upcoming game is slated to release in 2026.¬†
Like the films, Paranormal Activity will feature found-footage-style gameplay as well as a ‚ÄúHaunt System,‚Äù which dynamically changes the types of scares that unfold based on players‚Äô actions. Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn‚Äôt do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action.¬†


‚ÄúWe are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,‚Äù said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. ‚ÄúThe films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP‚Äôs Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.‚Äù
Paranormal Activity has no announced platforms. It‚Äôs not the franchise‚Äôs first foray into video games. A 2017 game called¬†Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.</span>

                              <span>After recently revealing the full launch roster for WWE 2K24, we now know the superstars arriving post-launch. 2K has revealed the five DLC packs rolling out throughout the year, and they include the Best in the World, one of the biggest female superstar signings in recent memory, and even a Grammy-nominated recording artist.¬†
CM Punk headlines this DLC roster, marking his first appearance in a WWE game since WWE 2K15 in 2014 (the year he walked out of the company). It would appear the Voice of the Voiceless‚Äô recent social media campaign to be included in the 2K24‚Äôs DLC plans paid off faster than expected, and he‚Äôs part of the first pack, no less. I smell a work, but it‚Äôs good to have him back in an official in-game capacity, regardless.
Other big highlights include Jade Cargill, Pat McAfee, and 2K24 soundtrack curator and award-winning music artist Post Malone. Check out the full list of superstars in each pack below.¬†

                              <span>While the main headline event from today&#x27;s Pok√©mon Presents showcase was the announcement of¬†Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, it wasn&#x27;t the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise&#x27;s signature trading cards.
Check out the reveal trailer below:


While there are several features available in the game,¬†Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day ‚Äì implying that more than that might come at a cost.
You&#x27;ll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.
The app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pok√©mon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pok√©mon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game&#x27;s big releases.</span>

It is also closing London Studio, the team behind PlayStation VR&#x27;s Blood &amp; Truth and VR Worlds. In a statement released by head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst, he seems to cite overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs.¬†
PlayStation&#x27;s Technology, Creative, and Support teams are also affected by these layoffs, according to Hulst. He writes, &quot;These are in addition to some smaller reductions in other teams across PlayStation Studios.&quot; These layoffs will result in an 8 percent reduction of staff, or around 900 people losing their jobs.¬†

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Pok√©mon Presents stream celebrating Pok√©mon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pok√©mon X and Y. It&#x27;s not just a long-awaited follow up to Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus ‚Äì it&#x27;s an overdue return to the world of Pok√©mon X and Y.
Check out some images from the trailer below:

The teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it&#x27;s not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flab√©b√©, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words &quot;urban redevelopment plan.&quot; This would suggest that Pok√©mon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus.
Other than the teaser, details are scarce. We&#x27;ll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo&#x27;s Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pok√©mon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called &quot;a worthwhile spin-off adventure.&quot;

Now, the companies have unveiled a new way to experience Lego in Fortnite: Lego Islands. Available today, Lego Islands is a family-friendly, all-ages play experience that sits alongside (and separate) from Lego Fortnite, and it&#x27;s kicking off with two islands.¬†
The first is Lego Raft Survival. Created in Unreal Editor for Fortnite, Raft Survival &quot;combines frenetic multiplayer problem solving with the classic Lego Pirates theme, as the infamous Blackbeard challenges players and their friends to stay afloat on a raft in unfriendly waters,&quot; a press release reads.

As it&#x27;s been a while since I last ran any 64-bit ARM 4K vs. 64K kernel page size benchmarks, while having remote access to the NVIDIA GH200 I ran a fresh comparison for looking at the performance advantages to switching over to a 64K page size kernel. These new 64K kernel numbers are shown alongside the recent AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon CPU reference benchmark results for a look at how the 4K vs. 64K page size affects the overall computing landscape.</span>

New information shows that this was likely the result of a &#x27;dynamic+ injunction&#x27;, ordered by the High Court of Delhi, India on behalf of Netflix and the Hollywood majors. The order requires ISPs to block dozens of pirate sites and also applies to domain name registrars, including the American company Namecheap.

                              <span>Experts warned that a radical site-blocking program without proper checks and balances would end badly in Italy. On Saturday, at least one Cloudflare IP address was added to the Piracy Shield anti-piracy system. According to an expert, that ended up blocking a large number of websites, including a charity, a telecoms company, and several schools. It&#x27;s the outcome many people predicted but one that could&#x27;ve been easily avoided.

                              <span>When I bring up the &quot;tactics RPG,&quot; it feels like there is a certain image that comes to mind: grid-based, turn-based, isometric, or top-down, with units hopping up and down terrain to bonk each other on the head with swords and magic.

                              <span>During last week‚Äôs Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it&#x27;s hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26.¬†
Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It‚Äôs up to protagonist Lilac, an ‚ÄúAttunder‚Äù capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game&#x27;s new trailer below.


Like Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.
While it‚Äôs unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game&#x27;s benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.</span>

The publication reports that 150 staff members at the British studio were informed today they are &quot;at risk&quot; of being laid off in accordance with U.K. labor laws that require companies to give notice ahead of layoffs.¬†
Shortly after¬†Bloomberg&#x27;s¬†report went live, the studio tweeted the following statement:¬†

It appeared during the Japanese version of the Partner Showcase, though, and the game quickly picked up steam online, thanks to its cool visual style, over-the-top action, and music by Final Fantasy XV composer Yoko Shimomura. Despite its absence on the English version of the Partner Showcase, we now know Reynatis is coming West later this year.¬†

                              <span>Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by¬†Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series&#x27; music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu ‚Äì in attendance ‚Äì could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event.¬†
However, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout &quot;the story of the show,&quot; SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra.¬†


&quot;[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,&quot; SanTheSly writes. &quot;The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I&#x27;d gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.&quot;¬†
That sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word &quot;repent&quot; to randomly feature a &quot;3.&quot; However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn&#x27;t the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way ‚Äì Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it.¬†

                              <span>Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or &quot;Switch 2&quot; as it&#x27;s been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to¬†VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from¬†VGC¬†and other outlets like¬†Eurogamer¬†that Nintendo&#x27;s next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei&#x27;s latest reporting.¬†


VGC¬†reports that¬†Nikkei writes, &quot;Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch&quot; to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports,¬†Nikkei¬†also writes that Nintendo&#x27;s next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen.¬†
Finally,¬†Nikkei¬†writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console&#x27;s launch at that time, according to¬†VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it&#x27;d follow in the Switch&#x27;s footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.
It&#x27;s important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch&#x27;s successor hasn&#x27;t even been publicly revealed yet, so there&#x27;s no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year.¬†

                              <span>Nobuo Uematsu, the celebrated composer behind the iconic soundtracks for much of the Final Fantasy series, has said he probably won‚Äôt score a full video game again. While Uematsu didn‚Äôt rule out creating the main themes for future games, he said that his days of scoring an entire game are likely over - leaving his last complete soundtrack as the OST for mobile-exclusive RPG Fantasian.

It follows a report that studio leadership told 150 people their jobs were at risk earlier today, with around 90 staff expected to eventually leave the business following the consultation.

                              <span>The roguelikelike deck-building poker game Balatro is frankly the only game I care for right now. My head fizzes with ideas for fiendish combos and deeply illegal hands. I&#x27;m delighted by its deserved success, with the makers boasting that it sold enough to become profitable within one hour then sold 250,000 copies in 72 hours. In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it&#x27;s so damn successful is because they&#x27;ve barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it&#x27;s free to do its own thing outside genre conventions. What&#x27;s interesting to me in this is how Balatro has built on a game which did influence it, the slot machine-building game Luck Be A Landlord.

He feels that Siege can &quot;last forever&quot;, adding that &quot;I&#x27;m not going to name names, but you see games go through sequels and just completely drop the ball.&quot;

                              <span>Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you&#x27;ll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It&#x27;s a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively &quot;provincialises&quot; the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved.

                              <span>2024 continues its efforts to be the worst year in my memory, as delightful indie development studio Die Gute Fabrik have halted work. The studio, notable for its lovely story-driven games about forging personal connections in strange or difficult worlds - e.g. Mutazione and the more recent Saltsea Chronicles - was unable to find funding for its new project, after a year of searching, so is shutting up work. All of the staff, including the leadership team, will be looking for new work come mid-march.

                              <span>Nightingale‚Äôs dapper cast of cross-dimensional pathfinders are right about one thing: realmwalking is dangerous business. Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.
This crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn‚Äôt yet ready for regular handheld play. That‚Äôs nothing developers Inflexion Games won‚Äôt tell you themselves ‚Äì they‚Äôre &quot;not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,&quot; after all ‚Äì but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.

                              <span>Austrian developers Microbird released a new trailer for their upcoming Alpine dungeon-crawler Dungeons Of Hinterberg over the weekend, giving us a closer look at some of the eponymous dungeon environments we&#x27;ll be biffing monsters in come its release later this summer. In addition to the previously revealed mountainsides and glacial snow peaks, it looks like Hinterberg will have a big green swamp to travel to as well. Question is: will it be a poison FromSoft variety of swamp? Or something more innocuous? Hard to tell with that searingly green water on display, but one thing is certain: with Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree and its confirmed poison swamp launching on June 21st, this summer won&#x27;t be short on big bog energy.

                              <span>When I did my undergrad degree in the nowadays-blissful-seeming early noughties, I swore off videogames entirely. I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble&#x27;s Age Of Mythology.
I&#x27;m not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn&#x27;t even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn&#x27;t bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren&#x27;t for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here&#x27;s a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.

                              <span>New week, yet more videogames! Gosh, those developers are incorrigible. I would characterise this week&#x27;s new game releases as a gentle blend of cosy simulation and nostalgia, served on a bed of fantasy roguelikes. If I had to pick a most-anticipated, it&#x27;d be a toss-up between the remaster of a shooter I adored in my teens and the breezy amateur photography game that teaches you the kanji for &quot;flower&quot;.

However, information provided by Peter Sunde&#x27;s Njalla suggests cause for optimism, potentially in the next few hours or within the next few days.

The news was revealed by the head of AGCOM and local anti-piracy group FAPAV, who also addressed media reports that overblocking is already affecting innocent parties. Those media reports, published by reputable outlets, were dismissed as &quot;fake news.&quot; In reality, the claim that Piracy Shield is &quot;working perfectly&quot; isn&#x27;t just fake, it&#x27;s pure propaganda.

                              <span>Turbo Kid is a 2015 movie set in a post-apocalypse in which a comic book fan battles a local tyrant, with gory, comedic, &#x27;80s-pastiching results. It was not a film I expected to get a metroidvania sequel, but here it is with a new demo and an April release date.

Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I‚Äôm going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.</span>

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel¬†Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.¬†

                              <span>Developer Team Ninja has released a new behind-the-scenes video for the upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive, Rise of the R≈çnin, and it features new gameplay showing off the game&#x27;s tough and fast action combat. Unsurprisingly, the game continues to look great.¬†
This new look at the game&#x27;s action features conversation from game producer and director Fumihiko Yasuda and animation lead Kosuke Wakamatsu discussing how Team Ninja approached the combat. They say it started with determining the different ideologies within R≈çnin history, why certain individuals fought the way they did, and how that translates to a game aiming to be authentic to the Bakumatsu history.¬†
Check it the new Rise of the R≈çnin gameplay for yourself below:¬†

As we await Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is due out on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Disney Plus has dropped a documentary that might tide fans over. Titled¬†Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds, this film &quot;explores the creative process behind Hideo Kojima launching his independent studio up to the completion of Death Stranding.&quot;
It was announced last year before debuting at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival¬†but starting today, you can stream it on Disney Plus.¬†

We haven&#x27;t yet watched it but given Kojima&#x27;s love of movies, we&#x27;re excited to see what a documentary about the man himself is like. The release of¬†Hideo Kojima: Connecting Worlds¬†follows the debut of Grounded II: The Making of the Last of Us Part II, which also provided a behind-the-scenes look at video game development.¬†
For more, read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†Death Stranding review and then read about why Death Stranding Director&#x27;s Cut is worth another trek across America. After that, watch the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is expectedly weird.¬†

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix&#x27;s latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it&#x27;s the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter).¬†
Currently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.
There‚Äôs only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.

As you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it&#x27;s important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best ‚Äì released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site.¬†
Still, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike.¬†

                              <span>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, the third-person live-service multiplayer shooter from Batman: Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios, launched earlier this month. It received middling reviews ‚Äì read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 ‚Äì and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had &quot;fallen short of our expectations,&quot; as reported by¬†IGN.¬†


More specifically, that&#x27;s Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady&#x27;s latest effort fell short of the company&#x27;s expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to¬†IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League&#x27;s missed expectations set Warner Bros.&#x27; games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.
Wiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company&#x27;s massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow.¬†

                              <span>Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, the momentum-based 3D platformer from developer Evening Star, surprise launched earlier this week after appearing in a Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct. During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game&#x27;s February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it&#x27;s a feat to behold.¬†
If you haven&#x27;t yet checked out Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, it&#x27;s a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo&#x27;s popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot.¬†
Check out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway, below:¬†
Vanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?

As you can see, this designer ‚Äì Milena ‚Äì completes the first level with one continuous combo. We&#x27;re not sure we&#x27;re quite up to the task but we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell.¬†
Penny&#x27;s Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.¬†

                              <span>It‚Äôs been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game‚Äôs last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what‚Äôs been going on with the team.
As reported by¬†The Indie Informer, Neostream‚Äôs Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,
The rest of Neostream&#x27;s update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.


Little Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console&#x27;s launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You&#x27;ll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces.¬†
Little Devil Inside has no release window but we&#x27;re hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.</span>

                              <span>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently said Skull And Bones is a &quot;quadruple-A game&quot;, which I think is very accurate, actually. &quot;AAAA&quot; is the sound that escapes my lips as I embark on yet another hour-long sail to retrieve some logs, or when I&#x27;m doing my little deliveries and a brigantine starts on me. After 11 years in development, Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate game isn&#x27;t necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.

                              <span>When dramatic parents panicked over the satanic influence of Doom in the 90s, maybe they had a point. Doom has burned through people&#x27;s souls and minds, filling them with a desire to play Id Software&#x27;s seminal shooter on every device they can. The question &quot;Can it run Doom?&quot; has driven these demonic vassals to make it playable on everything from tractors to teletext. These hellbound hearts are even daring to corrupt the totemic device of American liberty: the lawnmower. Come April, you will be able to play Doom on the Husqvarna Nera line of robotic automowers. Is nothing sacred?

But that&#x27;s as it should be: if you want to appreciate what Arrowhead&#x27;s Starship Troop &#x27;em up shares with Konami&#x27;s open world stealth bonanza, it&#x27;s better to Helldive on your lonesome.

                              <span>Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city‚Äôs border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you‚Äôre going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who‚Äôs down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It‚Äôs very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you‚Äôll gel with Lil Guardsman‚Äôs sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.
It&#x27;s also not shy about where it‚Äôs taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that‚Äôs more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you‚Äôll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you&#x27;re off the clock, it&#x27;s time to pick up the game&#x27;s wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It‚Äôs admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope‚Äôs magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day‚Äôs horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.

                              <span>I know this sort of thing has been said before around these parts, but in scanning through the endless reams of Steam Next Fest demos earlier this month and trying to work out what these games are and whether they&#x27;re worth downloading, I truly believe it&#x27;s a sentiment that&#x27;s worth repeating. When I first saw the name C.A.R.D.S RPG: The Misty Battlefield appear on the Next Fest landing page, I instantly thought, &#x27;Yes, here we go, now we&#x27;re talking&#x27;. 
Well, my first thought was actually, &#x27;Gee, if only there was an easy way to know what this game&#x27;s about based on just the title alone,&#x27; but that&#x27;s just me being facetious. Ultimately, I have a lot of respect for this kind of naming convention, and the fact it&#x27;s also being made by the Octopath Traveler developers Acquire is really just the icing on the cake.

                              <span>What happens when you combine two great puzzle games? You get one puzzle game which makes me, an accredited professional fool, feel dizzy with noncomprehension. That game is Sokobond Express, which launched yesterday and combines the atom-shoving chemistry of Sokobond with the route-planning puzzling of Cosmic Express. So you have to draw paths around a grid to gather atoms to correctly build a desired molecule. That&#x27;s all. Just molecular chemistry and pathing, at the same time. Oh, my poor foolish head.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I was expecting from Graven, but it still feels like it wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected. That&#x27;s both good and bad. It has the look of a 90s throwback FPS, the cool atmosphere and action RPG (barely RPG, really, restricted to which weapons you upgrade) combat of something from the 2000s like Rune or Dark Messiah, with a hint of a modern immersive sim. There is, I think, a better game to be made with those parts in a different arrangement. This one is only kinda good.

                              <span>This week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct was stuffed full of games that will also be making their way to PC over the next few months, but the one I haven&#x27;t been able to stop thinking about is the newly-announced Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It&#x27;s the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicol√°s Recabarren, and they&#x27;ve also partnered with composer Tom√°s Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It&#x27;s a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it&#x27;s Arranger&#x27;s world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that&#x27;s really piqued my curiosity. Come and watch the lovely announcement trailer below and see what I mean.

                              <span>Credit to Nightingale, I‚Äôve been enjoying the early access form of Inflexion‚Äôs gaslamp fantasy survival crafter a fair bit more than I did its older stress test build. The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I‚Äôve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic &#x27;n&#x27; moustaches world. There‚Äôs potential here, but it‚Äôs very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.
Besides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I‚Äôve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don‚Äôt need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.

                              <span>Yesterday I was off sick with a fever and, as I often do when I&#x27;m laid up ill, immediately set out to consume the most nihilistic and depressing entertainment media I could find. On the film front, I watched Session 9, in which some men hired to remove asbestos from a collapsing 19th century asylum do not have a very nice time. On the game front, I played The Tribe Must Survive, a colony management sim from Walking Tree Games GmbH and Starbreeze Publishing, which is now available in early access.

                              <span>After launching Nightingale into early access on Tuesday, developers Inflexion Games (led by former BioWare CEO Aaryn Flynn) have quickly realised a big miscalculation: lots of players want an offline mode. The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call. They plan to remedy this, but it&#x27;s not yet clear when they&#x27;ll actually add an offline mode.

                              <span>From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki has acknowledged that members of the Dark Souls studio had misgivings about Elden Ring&#x27;s shift to a full-blown open world format, while qualifying that Elden Ring&#x27;s vision for an open world was never &quot;traditional&quot;. Rather, Elden Ring is an &quot;open world&quot; game in the same way that Dark Souls is a &quot;hard&quot; game, Miyazaki feels. Confused? Well, this is the godfather of the notoriously unforthcoming Souls series we&#x27;re talking about. I&#x27;ve never interviewed the guy, but I suspect he composes his responses using the game&#x27;s soapstone messaging system.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Optane drives are legendary in PC tech circles, offering random performance and low latency that remains unmatched amongst PCIe 3.0 drives. This Intel Optane 905P drive is the biggest they ever made at 1.5TB, and now it&#x27;s reduced to $380 when you use code SYADP2Z384 at Newegg. 
For systems that accept PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 drives, I&#x27;d recommend sticking with our usual gaming SSD recommendations, but for PCIe 3.0 systems this is a fascinating option that emphasises random performance against sequential speeds. I recorded some of the very fastest game load times with this drive when I tested it against other PCIe 3.0 options, and its random write speeds are competitive even with later generation PCIe 4.0 alternatives.

                              <span>Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It&#x27;s a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.
The original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&amp;D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I&#x27;m pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there&#x27;s good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.

                              <span>Every few years, gorgeous action adventure Little Devil Inside re-surfaces with another stunning, exciting trailer. We last saw it at a PlayStation State Of Play back in 2021, where it was seemingly on track for a 2022 release.

It&#x27;s been radio silence ever since, but it has now once again resurfaced, with another gorgeous trailer and a promise that the development team, now smaller, is back &quot;with the duty and conscience to fulfill what we set out to do.&quot;

                              <span>As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It&#x27;s clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.

We also reminisce about our other favourite gaming crossovers, and try to dream up some cross-universe mashups of our own.
Plus! We talk about what we‚Äôve been playing this week, consider whether we would &quot;RoboCop ourselves,&quot; and I disgust Alice with a confectionary confession.

                              <span>Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is one of those third person action adventure games I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since I first read about it in Edge in May 2022, even though we&#x27;ve seen and heard relatively little about it since. Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it&#x27;s steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I&#x27;m just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn&#x27;t been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too. Love a big kick, me.

While developers Io Interactive did eventually start bringing back Elusive Targets due to popular demand/widespread frustration, some have proved more elusive than others. Four years since he last appeared, a target played by famous dier Sean Bean will return in March. Kill him, kill him while you can. It&#x27;s what he would want. It&#x27;s how he pays his rent. Craft services don&#x27;t even offer him a cuppa until he croaks.

Tucked away in a PlayStation blog post about upcoming PS VR2 games, Sony Interactive content communications manager Gillen McAllister confirmed that Sony are &quot;currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC&quot; and that the plan is have this extra support ready within 2024.

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct got rather overshadowed by a certain trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, but there were still plenty of good news nuggets to be had in there for us PC folks - which I&#x27;ve summarised for you below. The long and short of it is: more release dates! Loads of &#x27;em! And they&#x27;re all coming in the first half of 2024 as well. I love it when a schedule comes together.

                              <span>As expected, Microsoft yesterday confirmed that four of their games are headed to rival consoles: Pentiment to PlayStations 4 &amp; 5 and Nintendo Switch; Hi-Fi Rush to PS5; Grounded to PS4, PS5, and Switch; and Sea Of Thieves to PS5. It&#x27;s nice to see barriers between systems coming down and all, and it&#x27;ll likely have consequences of note to serious businessheads, but what relevance does this have for us as a PC gaming website? Well! Grounded and Sea Of Thieves will support cross-platform multiplayer, so we&#x27;ll be able to play them with our consolatory chums. That&#x27;s nice.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a little masochistic streak in me that croons with joy whenever I reach the moment of impending doom in turn-based strategy games. You know the moment I mean. The one where the world fills with enemies patiently bobbing and snarling while you try to conjure up an impossibly perfect set of moves that&#x27;ll keep things going for one more turn? Cobalt Core is great at this. I&#x27;ve only played a couple of runs so far, but boy, you&#x27;d better believe I know when the end is drawing near. It&#x27;s hard to miss, because the entire screen fills up with rows of damage numbers beaming down onto your hapless little spaceship.

It features a new story path, an improved battle system, new areas, and more, as you&#x27;d expect from Atlus&#x27; history of definitive editions. What&#x27;s more, while SMT 5 was a Switch exclusive when it came out in 2021, the new Vengeance edition will be heading to PC and other consoles, too. Do I have time for another enormous JRPG? Probably not, but I&#x27;ll admit that it&#x27;s got me very interested indeed.

A key suspect targeted in an earlier operation was out of the country. The action follows a criminal complaint filed by companies including Bell, Videotron, and Rogers.

                              <span>PlayStation VR2 launched in February of last year and while its debut featured new first-party titles like Horizon Call of the Mountain, our favorites on the new platform featured previously released titles like Resident Evil Village. Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year.¬†
&quot;[We&#x27;re] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,&quot; a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. &quot;We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.&quot;


The rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year.¬†
For more about the hardware, read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†PS VR2 review, and then read¬†Game Informer&#x27;s¬†Horizon Call of the Mountain review. After that, read about why Resident Evil Village is the PS VR2&#x27;s best exclusive, and then check out these 10 games to play using your VR headset.¬†

                              <span>Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.


The 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today‚Äôs footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs still ‚Äúheads down‚Äù working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future.¬†
2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game&#x27;s official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pok√©mon but with guns. You can capture Pok√©mon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course.¬†
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1 reset the fighting universe when it launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC last September. Now, it&#x27;s time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena&#x27;s Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021&#x27;s¬†The Suicide Squad¬†and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28.¬†
Ahead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker&#x27;s gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood.¬†
Check out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below:¬†


As you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character&#x27;s live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits.¬†
Peacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6.¬†
Elsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March ‚Äì she&#x27;s an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game.¬†

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has quite the act to follow up ‚Äì it must both live up to the sky-high expectations set by its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and synthesize and modernize perhaps the most crucial chapter in our heroes&#x27; adventure across Gaia. While my 80 hours in Rebirth didn&#x27;t quite match the overall nirvana of Remake, it&#x27;s a game I struggled to put down. A few stumbling blocks, like a bloated and sometimes tedious open world and intermittently uneven pacing, threaten the highs of Rebirth. But an exciting and well-told story, with an a‚Ä¶</span>

Saying that X thing is the future is de rigueur for technology marketing. It&#x27;s something you hear repeatedly from videogames companies in particular, with their sequels and console generations and other chronological fixtures that form an endless staircase towards The New.

Actually stay sitting down, because it&#x27;s time to watch and think about the first trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree, which confirms that the Elden Ring DLC expansion will focus on Miquella, a rather tragic demigod character from the main game. Find the full video again below, together with my thoughts on just what the heck it all means.

                              <span>Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it&#x27;s less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it&#x27;s in 1.0. If you haven&#x27;t yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it&#x27;s very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.

Not just to foster some good old fashioned discussion among your good selves in the comments, but also as a way for those who aren&#x27;t able to join us for the end-of-month liveblog session to still take part in what everyone has to say about it. We&#x27;ll also try and stuff as many of your thoughts and observations into the liveblog discussion proper, too, to try and make it feel as communal as possible (and not just us waffling on about it for a full hour).  
So, folks, tell us what you think about the excellent Cobalt Core below. What you like, dislike, your favourite moments (or your most hated moments)... Anything goes.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time coming, but the first trailer for Borderlands has finally arrived after the first images of the movie emerged this week. First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox‚Äôs popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs.¬†


Directed by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ram√≠rez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora.¬†They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe.¬†
Borderlands hits theaters on August 9.</span>

                              <span>Sea of Thieves is the last Xbox first-party game officially confirmed for a new platform. Rare‚Äôs shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.
Sea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. ‚ÄúSomething we‚Äôve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,‚Äù says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below.¬†


As associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare‚Äôs nearly 40-year history that it‚Äôs released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.</span>

Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.

                              <span>Following today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.
Hi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.
Hi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves.¬†Hi-Fi Rush took home¬†Game Informer&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Best Microsoft Exclusive&quot; award and, as of this writing,¬†has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that&#x27;s not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.
Pentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather.¬†
When it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic.¬†Game¬†Informer&#x27;s Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is &quot;a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it‚Äôs being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it‚Äôs a must-play for fans of adventure games.&quot;
Pentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox&#x27;s Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.</span>

                              <span>After a long wait, we finally have details about Elden Ring&#x27;s upcoming DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on&#x27;s first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector&#x27;s Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.
You can check out the trailer below.


The trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella&#x27;s egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear&#x27;s head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.

The game&#x27;s official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here&#x27;s the official description.
The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.
Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.

Snake Rattle &#x27;N&#x27; Roll for NES
R.C. Pro-Am for NES
Battletoads in Battlemaniacs for SNES
Killer Instinct for SNES
Blast Corps for N64

While the ISP remains contributorily liable for pirating subscribers, a finding of vicarious copyright infringement was reversed. A new trial will determine the appropriate damages amount given these new conclusions.

                              <span>At the time of writing, at least dozens but most likely hundreds of pirate sites are effectively down due to a domain issue at a single registrar. The problem seems to be isolated to sites using .TV domains registered at Sarek Oy in Finland, a registrar well known for its pirate-friendly policies. As things stand, hundreds of domains are completely devoid of DNS, resulting in one of the biggest mass blackouts in recent history.

                              <span>On Monday, anti-piracy coalition ACE announced the shutdown of SiamBit, an 18-year-old torrent site said to have as many as 100,000 paying members, mostly from Thailand. While those details are unusual, the bigger picture is quite extraordinary. Four people arrested on suspicion of running the site include the suspected ringleader, a  professional racing driver in his late thirties. Events show how an arrest in January triggered a domino effect leading right to his door.

                              <span>Several film companies are continuing efforts to obtain piracy-related information in connection with Reddit users. While Reddit declined to comply with recent subpoenas for subscriber information, it handed over the personal details of one user last year. A new court filing sheds some light on the type of evidence being sought by the filmmakers, which includes BitTorrent activity and pirate site visits.

Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.</span>

Access real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio

Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google&#x27;s secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection‚Äîall without leaving Android Studio. When you&#x27;re done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.
During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don&#x27;t already have a Firebase project, it&#x27;s easy to create one. To learn more, go to¬†Device Streaming in Android Studio.

General fixes and features
Below¬†is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug 
reports, which help us to make Android Studio better. If you encounter a problem, let us know by¬†reporting a bug. You can also¬†vote for an existing issue¬†to indicate that it also affects

                              <span>OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It‚Äôs packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
