If you want something to play out of the box, the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle has you covered. This edition runs for $599.99 and tosses in a digital code for the first-person Horizon spin-off on top of everything that comes in the standard package.

                              <span>Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality&#x27;s Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can&#x27;t wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it&#x27;s hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we&#x27;ll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you&#x27;re interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish&#x27;s official website, where there&#x27;s info about the game&#x27;s different editions available for preorder and more.

That last bit will no doubt be the most controversial. Sony revealed on Wednesday that PS VR 2 will cost $550, even more than the PS5 required…

And next month, a very different Dwarf Fortress will be made available on Steam.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced a launch date for its long-awaited PlayStation VR2 hardware (PSVR2) — The PS5 exclusive technology will launch globally February 22, 2023, priced at $550 USD / £530 GBP / €600. The set includes a PSVR2 headset, controllers, and stereo headphones.

Alternately, a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle will include the above set complete with a download code for an additional $50/£40/€50. Developed by Firesprite and Guerilla Games, Call of the Mountain is, as you would expect, a VR adventure set within the beautiful, but highly hazardous, futureworld explored in acclaimed adventures Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and Horizon Forbidden West (2022). The PSVR2 system will have its own library of titles and is not compatible with previous PSVR releases.
If you&#x27;re interested in picking up the flashy new technology which, to my knowledge, doesn&#x27;t play Dactyl Nightmare, then pre-orders go live on the official PlayStation Direct store on November 15. SIE hints that not all orders will necessarily be served on launch day, with kits rolling out throughout the last week of February and into early March. For more details, visit the official PlayStation Blog.
These prices put the PS5 and PSVR2 kit somewhere in the region of $1000/£1000. I had some college.
PlayStation VR2 launches worldwide on February 22, 2023.

Square Enix, in association with developer Acquire, has released a new trailer for its charming-looking adventure sequel Octopath Traveler II. The surprisingly lengthy new preview, which you can check out below, introduces us to two members of the ensemble cast that will make up the game&#x27;s multi-threaded narrative.
First up, we meet Partitio, or &quot;The Merchant&quot;. This slick-tongued, noirish man is packed with the key weapons of wit and charisma, able to talk his way in and out of any sale, or even any situation. Curiously backed by some 1980&#x27;s sitcom-sounding music, we see Partitio utilize his retail skills to trade with townspeople, hire assistants, and synergize with mercenaries in order to give himself the edge either on the market or in battle. Despite his capitalistic nature, Partitio is shown to have a streak of nobility.

We are then introduced to the much darker character of Osvald, or &quot;The Scholar&quot;. Wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his family, Osvald will escape the ice-cold incarceration of &quot;The Frigid&quot; in order to learn of the true events behind his wife and daughter&#x27;s killing, (Although this trailer pretty much spoils it, good work, folks). As a studied individual, Osvald can scrutinize townspeople for secrets, and also study enemies in battle to learn their weak points and expose vulnerabilities.
In addition to the two new characters, the trailer also spotlights new travel options, with characters taking to the ocean by canoe, boat, or even a mighty ghost ship! All of Octopath Traveler II&#x27;s characters will have a &quot;Latent Power&quot;, (essentially a Limit Break), activated by building meter in battle. These unique abilities will help to turn the tide of battle in a pinch, so learn your characters&#x27; abilities and use them wisely.
Octopath Traveler II launches February 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

It might be time to polish those sunglasses and dig out that trenchcoat, as rumors abound this fine morning that cyberpunk RPG series Deus Ex is gearing up for a return. That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who stated that the longtime developer is deep into its production cycle following its recent release from the Square Enix umbrella.
As reported yesterday, Schreier notes that Eidos Montreal is currently working on the franchise&#x27;s new entry alongside several other titles, including a brand-new IP and several co-development projects with Xbox, such as a new release in the high-fantasy series, Fable. The Deus Ex release is said to be in its &quot;very, very early&quot; stages, so I wouldn&#x27;t go expecting any announcements until at least later 2023, or perhaps even further down the line. Still, fans will be pleased to hear that the cult series has not been set adrift.
The first Deus Ex title launched on PC way back in 2000, spinning a typically cyberpunkian tale of capitalism gone wild and the nanotech-infused rebels who aim to bring the structure crashing down. While the acclaimed release was followed by several sequels of varying quality, it was the launch of the 2007 epic Deus Ex: Human Revolution that truly brought the series its mainstream success. The most recent game in the series is 2016&#x27;s Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, which continued the franchise&#x27;s penchant for complex action, deep narrative, and depressingly familiar political overtones.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.

                              <span>&quot;At the time when we signed on, it wasn’t a GOTY title&quot;.
When developer Hazelight Studios launched It Takes Two back in March 2021 in partnership with Electronic Arts, it&#x27;s safe to say that the co-op action-adventure title took everybody by surprise. By combining split-screen gameplay with a narrative that&#x27;s both hilarious and poignant in equal measure, it struck a chord with gamers worldwide, going on to win several prestigious awards, perhaps most notably the Game of the Year gone at 2021&#x27;s The Game Awards.
It seemed a no-brainer that the game would eventually make its way to the Switch, then, and it&#x27;s certainly something that&#x27;s been on the minds of the developers over at Hazelight Studios and porting studio Turn Me Up Games for quite a while.

A former developer on the N64 platformer Bomberman Hero has shared design documents for the game on Twitter. These never-before-seen sketches and notes show us a snippet of the behind-the-scenes on Hudson Soft&#x27;s radical departure from the Bomberman formula.
@nori_bomber — whose career started on the Sega Mark III and went on to work on games in the Mario, Genjin, Super Robo, and Bomberman series — shared the photos, which include sketches of cutscenes and landmarks, dialogue, and interactions between Bomberman and a robot. Bomberman Hero (known as Bomberman Hero: Rescue Princess Millian! in Japan) was the second 3D Bomberman game but is a single-player platformer with no multiplayer (unlike its predecessor, Bomberman 64).

This review originally went live in 2016, and we&#x27;re updating and republishing it to mark the game&#x27;s arrival in Switch&#x27;s N64 library via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.

Since 1998, the Mario Party series has entertained gamers by mixing the play of traditional board games with frantic minigame action. There have been a great many entries over the years but this is one of the most warmly regarded and fondly remembered. Known for blister-creating rotate-the-stick minigames, Nintendo and developer Hudson Soft delivered a similar experience to the first game in this first sequel, only bigger and more impressive.

Both Mario Party and Mario Party 2 have rolled their way onto the Switch today thanks to the NSO Expansion Pack, bringing with them waves of party co-op nostalgia (and/or rivalry).
Aside from the minigames, music and those creepy character designs, for many of us one of the biggest memories of the original N64 title is the pain caused by rotating the Control Stick with the palm of your hand - hey, that boat isn&#x27;t going to paddle itself. Fortunately, Nintendo has issued a warning which precedes the original Mario Party this time round, reminding us to rotate the control stick using our thumb, not our palm.

                              <span>It&#x27;s-a me, Casio!
We love a good retro themed watch here at Nintendo Life and it looks like Casio G-Shock has come out with one of the most beautiful designs we&#x27;ve ever seen.
Shipping to customers from November 11th, 2022, the G-Shock X Super Mario Brothers DW-5600SMB-4 is based on the seminal platformer Super Mario Bros. for the NES, originally launched back in 1985. Its display features the typical Casio features, including a digital clock, date function, alarms, and other lovely bits and bobs, but the bezel itself displays an adorable pixel art green shell along with the &#x27;Super Mario Bros. Casio&#x27; title at the top. As is the case with most Casio watches, this version will feature a backlight, but instead of the usual boring plain light, you&#x27;ll be treated to a lovely little image of Mario along with the &#x27;1Up&#x27; logo.

Today sees both the OG Mario Party and its successor, Mario Party 2, land on the Switch thanks to the NSO Expansion Pass, and this has led to a certain amount of reminiscing from the games&#x27; developers.
One such peek into the past comes courtesy of Mario Party composer Yasunori Mitsuda (thanks, @gosokkyu, for the translation). Tweeting his memories of working on the original game, Mitsuda revealed that a disagreement over what constitutes &#x27;jazz&#x27; caused around 200 songs to be scrapped from the original soundtrack.

Konami has revealed its earnings report for the first six months of the year and the results aren&#x27;t pretty. Despite the release of some titles with which we have had a lot of fun - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection doing a lot of lifting on the &#x27;some&#x27; there - the company reported a 34.4% drop in earnings.
This finding came courtesy of Kantan Games CEO @serkantoto, with the video game consultant noting that Konami&#x27;s profits reflect the company&#x27;s recent poor performance in the world of mobile apps - particularly those in the Yu-Gi-Oh! series.

                              <span>Developers Munfish have finally announced that its bonkers Soviet shooter Atomic Heart will release on February 21st, 2023. The new trailer for shooty alternate universe action RPG Atomic Heart is a bit of a trip, frankly. Barrelling along at the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, you can just about make out some weird looking Soviet robots, head-splitting mutants, and what seemed to be a truck plummeting towards towering futuristic architecture. Watch the eye-meltingly speedy trailer below, you’ll probably need some bugeye goggles afterwards to recuperate your peepers.

                              <span>The next instalment in the mysterious Rusty Lake puzzle series arrives today, and it takes things in a different direction than past games. A time-travelling conundrum that requires one person to play in the past and another in the future, The Past Within is the series’ first co-op puzzler. It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>A return to the cyberpunk world of Deus Ex is coming courtesy of Human Revolution and Mankind Divided developers Eidos Montreal, it’s been claimed. The snippet of info that the new Deus Ex game is in the very, very early stages was reported by Bloomberg following yesterday’s revelation that sister studio Onoma is closing down. Eidos Montreal are also alleged to be working on a completely new game, as well as helping out with some co-development on some Microsoft-owned series, including the new Fable.

                              <span>As Replika Elster, Signalis will force you to untangle a mess of writhing flesh and malfunctioning memories to separate dream from lived experience. So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.
Fundamentally, it&#x27;s a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.

                              <span>While initially leary of AMD Zen 4&#x27;s &quot;double pumped&quot; approach for supporting AVX-512 using a 256-bit data path, it&#x27;s proven to be very efficient for performance and yield great results without negative clock impairments or wreaking havoc on the power consumption. Back in September I delivered a detailed AVX-512 performance analysis on the Ryzen 9 7950X while in this article is a detailed benchmark look at the Core i9 11900K against the Ryzen 7 7700X. The Core i9 11900K being the currently last Intel desktop CPU officially supporting AVX-512 while the Ryzen 7 7700X was used for matching the core/thread count of that Rocket Lake processor for this AVX-512 on/off comparison.</span>

                              <span>Look, everyone needs a flash drive. These things used to be the new hotness, back before email and cloud storage made them a bit irrelevant, but it&#x27;s still jolly useful to have one on hand to install (or recover) an OS, play (legally) downloaded videos on your TV or just bring your presentation in without worrying about something going wrong. 
So: the SanDisk 32GB Ultra Flair flash drive is down to £5 on Amazon after a ~40% discount. If you&#x27;ve not got a good, fast USB drive, then why not pick this one up while it&#x27;s on sale?

                              <span>Wanna know something cool? You can pick up Intel&#x27;s cheapest 12th-gen Core processor for £105 after a discount at CCL, with the Core i3 12100F offering incredible performance for this kind of money. 
It&#x27;s able to outmatch some classic great value gaming CPUs, like the Ryzen 5 3600X and Core i5 11400F, and even comes close to the powerful (and more expensive) Core i5 11600K. All this with PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, given the right motherboard - and this is a surprisingly great way to jump on 12th-gen, while leaving plenty of space to upgrade to a higher tier CPU down the road.

                              <span>A jaded private investigator teams up with her 12-year-old kid detective self to solve a mystery in The Grown-Up Detective Agency, a lovely bit of free interactive fiction. Bell Park doesn&#x27;t know how or why her perfectly precocious child self is here, now, but who better to help crack a case involving her former childhood best friend? And who better to offer fresh perspective on her adult life? It&#x27;s a funny little buddy cop story, and it made my morning.

                              <span>An official deep dive video has confirmed that FIFA 23&#x27;s Ultimate Team will not get a dedicated World Cup mode during the tournament, which begins on November 20th. Starting with Season 2 on November 11th though, the international football competition is being represented in FUT with plenty of seasonal gubbins instead. The World Cup is, of course, also coming to the main game from November 9th in single-player and online Tournament mode. You can watch the FIFA 23 World Cup deep dive video below.

                              <span>Sometimes, I just want to wander around an aesthetically pleasing landscape with nice music doing menial tasks - and that’s exactly what I got from Paradise Marsh, a lovely little wildlife game from LazyEti. I’ve been playing some pretty intense games recently, throttling my game controller as I run away from literal waves of rats in A Plague Tale: Requiem and shifting my detective brain into overdrive grappling with the excellent mysteries in The Case of the Golden Idol.
I desperately need a game to sink into, basically Lo-fi Hip Hop Beats to Relax/Study To: The Game, or the equivalent of a deep body massage but directly onto my brain. Paradise Marsh has been the exact tonic I’ve needed, a chill bug-collectathon where you wander around pleasant, pastel landscapes discovering lots of fun little curiosities. It’s wonderful.

Unlike when Bastion was disabled because of his glitching ultimate, however, Mei does at least have a return date pencilled in. Blizzard are aiming to get her back in Overwatch 2 for November 15th, when the game’s next scheduled patch drops. That still might slip, though. What? I had to get an ice crack in.

                              <span>Just over a week ago, we launched a new introductory offer for the RPS supporter programme that chops the price of our monthly Standard tier down to just £1 / $1 for your first month. This primarily gets you the ad-free version of the site (alongside some other small quality of life bonuses), but after listening to your feedback, it&#x27;s clear that the thing you really want to sample is the exclusive Premium-tier supporter articles we write alongside our regular games coverage. So we&#x27;re doing just that. 
For the month of November, we&#x27;ll be making a selection of supporter articles available to all Standard subscribers. We&#x27;ve also made a bunch of Sin Vega&#x27;s indie-focused Scout Report posts available to all Standard subscribers right now, too, as a little extra thank you for signing up. And to all our existing Premium tier supporters, we&#x27;ve got something for you as well. As an even bigger thank you for all your continued support, we&#x27;re doing a bumper crop of supporter articles this month, with the aim of publishing one each day of the week for the whole of November. But wait... there&#x27;s more!

Microsoft today laid out the comings and goings for the first half of November, headlined by Return To Monkey Island. The revival of the revered point &#x27;n&#x27; click adventure game series will hit Game Pass next week, and until then you can tide yourself over with modernistic adventures from more of Telltale&#x27;s The Walking Dead. Read on for the rest of the games coming in the next fortnight, including some on their launch day, and those sadly leaving too.

                              <span>Mount &amp; Blade 2 Colon Bannerlord is disappointing. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad. In fact, it&#x27;s overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord&#x27;s design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what&#x27;s been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn&#x27;t meaningfully improve it at all.
In between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click &quot;make charcoal&quot;, then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you&#x27;ll discard hundreds of them. You can&#x27;t do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone&#x27;s pommel.

                              <span>Myst developers Cyan have revealed they’re working on a “from-the-ground-up” remake of its sequel, Riven.

A Bayonetta 3 win is a pretty easy thing to talk about for one! All of that and so much more on Spot Dodge!

Sony is known to go pretty full out to promote their games, and with the game&#x27;s release just over a week away, they&#x27;ve pulled out all of the stops for God of War: Ragnarok. Their newest ad features none other than the likes of famed actor and director Ben Stiller dressed up as Kratos himself, alongside Lebron James and John Travolta.
The premise of the ad is that Kratos and Atreus father/son dynamic is something that all parents can relate to, and so Stiller is hosting a kind of God of War-themed parenting support group. He discusses his own struggles in relating to his son, and attempts to help James and Travolta connect with their children, too. By the way, those are actually all of their real children shown in the short, which is pretty cool if you ask me.

Kratos&#x27; newfound difficulties with fatherhood have been a meme since the first game in the God of War reboot series came out back in 2018, so it&#x27;s a smart move for Sony to lean into that. Is it weird to see Ben Stiller in a Kratos outfit? Yeah. Am I confused as to why they chose Ben Stiller, Lebron James, and John Travolta of all people to be the faces of their marketing campaign for God of War? Absolutely. Is this whole thing kinda cringey? I&#x27;d say so.
At this point, they have to know that Ragnarok is going to be one of the biggest launches of the year, so at least Sony seems to be having fun with it. It&#x27;s kind of a pet peeve of mine to see games taking themselves too seriously, so I still prefer this to some edgy skit about how God of War is going to redefine gaming or whatever.

                              <span>PlayStation and Xbox owners can return to this classic series
The return of a classic adventure series is sailing for new ports next week. Return to Monkey Island arrives on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 8.
While it originally launched for just PC and Switch, owners of newer consoles will also be able to finally return to the Monkey Island series. Additionally, Return to Monkey Island will be on Xbox Game Pass, for console alongside PC and cloud.
You can see the trailer for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yHYhubDqWCY
Return to Monkey Island first released in September for PC and Switch, and it seemed like it turned out pretty good. The story continues the journey of Guybrush Threepwood, as a new and dramatic series of events takes place on Mêlée Island.
Heading home
As Zoey wrote for us in the initial review, Return to Monkey Island is a follow-up to the series that&#x27;s got a good amount of callbacks and references. For Monkey Island fans who haven&#x27;t got around to it yet though, the new platforms provide a chance to finally check it out. And hey, Game Pass makes it easy to see if this kind of adventure is your cup of tea.
Return to Monkey Island joins a pretty stellar lineup of Game Pass games this month, too. Obisidian&#x27;s historical murder-mystery Pentiment is also due up on the Pass. As is Somerville, the extraterrestrial thriller. And if you really just need to lose hours watching bats and skeletons explode, Vampire Survivors is on-deck too.
Return to Monkey Island hits PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 8.

In what might be perhaps the single most niche emporium ever established, Japan will be getting a &quot;pop-up shop&quot; entirely devoted to the cult franchise Clock Tower. Situated in &quot;The Akihabara Container&quot; in Tokyo, the store will offer up a variety of exclusive goodies pertaining to the Gothic survival horror series.
The Clock Tower faithful can visit the location from November 3, rolling out fistfuls of Yen in order to bag merchandise based upon the original Clock Tower (1995) and its sequel Clock Tower 2: The Struggle Within (1998). Up for grabs will be mugs, keychains, wall scrolls, clothing apparel, standees, posters, and more, with the piece de resistance being an old-school alarm clock that plays the game&#x27;s title theme!
Check out the goodies in the flyer below, courtesy of Famitsu and Siliconera.

The Clock Tower series combines classic point-and-click gameplay with the survival horror tropes of the mid-&#x27;90s, as protagonists pick their way through creepy locations in an effort to stay one step ahead of the terrifying killer &quot;Scissorman&quot;. Inspired by Dario Argento&#x27;s bug-filled 1985 flick, Phenomena, the Clock Tower games are praised for their mood, classic visuals, and unnerving atmosphere, but the series as a whole has always been hampered by slow, and in some cases archaic, gameplay mechanics. Regardless, they have found their own dedicated following — as all horror franchises tend to do.
Regardless, it&#x27;s incredibly quirky to see an entire store devoted to its presence, and I&#x27;m sure fans will make sure they grab a hold of as many goodies as possible before the doors close for good at the end of the month. The Clock Tower store is situated in The Akihabara Container in Tokyo, Japan, and will operate from November 3 — November 29.

It looks like Embracer Group is shuttering one of its recent acquisitions. Onoma, formerly known as Square Enix Montreal before its Embracer acquisition, has reportedly been shut down.
A new Bloomberg report says that, according to sources familiar with the situation, the Montreal-based studio will see some staff move to sister-studio Eidos Montreal. Employees were reportedly informed of the move today.
There&#x27;s also more to the move. Bloomberg reports that Eidos Montreal has reduced the scope of one unannounced project and will cancel another. The company also plans to work with Microsoft to develop some games, including a Fable title, according to Bloomberg&#x27;s info.

                              <span>Simulate a new dwarven life in December
It&#x27;s time to break earth and set up a new home. The impossibly deep simulator Dwarf Fortress has set a Steam and Itch launch date of December 6, 2022.
This infamous engine for incredible internet stories is often perceived as pretty dense. But as part of the Steam launch, Bay 12 Games is also rolling out several major draws for newcomers to make dwarven life a bit easier to manage.
First off, the graphical tile set. Rather than ASCII characters moving around, Dwarf Fortress has pixel visuals you can pick up on a bit easier. Modders and community members have made these tools before, but Steam Dwarf Fortress arrives with a packed-in tile set.
Secondly, the new player experience has been updated to include tutorials. Via the Steam page, these tutorials will guide you through the process of building your first fortress and keeping all the dwarves inside happy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2K7T5LXQPJI
Other than that, this is largely still Dwarf Fortress. It&#x27;s still a massive, simulated world of possibilities and potential disaster. All it needs is a few intrepid dwarves.
Building the fortress
Dwarf Fortress has been the subject of many lengthy forum posts and storytimes. Much like EVE Online, it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s endlessly fascinating to read about, but seems intimidating from the outside too.
With a Steam launch, updated graphics, and new player experience, this might be the time for me to give Dwarf Fortress an honest go of it. I&#x27;ve read enough stories. I&#x27;m ready to establish my own beautiful fortress, then watch it fall apart to infighting and chaos.
Developers Tarn and Zach Adams have been working on this game for ages, and seem set to keep doing so. And maybe this version is just the right jumping-on point as they dive further into what this simulation can possibly do.
Dwarf Fortress hits Steam and Itch on December 6, 2022.

                              <span>With the holidays coming up, you might be losing some
When do My Nintendo points expire? Well it depends on the type of point it is! Let&#x27;s go over both briefly as we head into the holiday season.
So My Nintendo Platinum Points expire after six months from collection. It&#x27;s important to game the system as much as possible: meaning, there are ways to bank missions and not actually complete them until you need them. Our guide goes into more detail on this, and how you can use Fire Emblem Heroes to your advantage.
Gold Points, which are more like cash that can be used directly for eShop payments, expire in 12 months. There&#x27;s a lot more leeway here with the expanded timeframe, but note that since a lot of folks make purchases in December, you might be coming up on a time period where a bunch will expire.
To check both of these timelines, you&#x27;ll want to head to the &quot;Point Summary&quot; link at the bottom of the main My Nintendo login page, then click on point expiration.
How to earn more My Nintendo Points for the holidays
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

When it comes to unpredictable gaming announcements in 2022, nothing is going to beat the news that 1988&#x27;s Z-movie Killer Klowns from Outer Space was being adapted into a modern-day video game — While it still something of a leftfield concept, Teravision Games has offered up a little more info on how accurately the developer is hoping to recapture the grotesque gory glory of the source material.
In a new blog post on the official website, Teravision details some side-by-side comparisons focusing on the locations, weapons, and, of course, the Killer Klowns themselves, showing the attention to detail being applied to the new asymmetrical adventure. While the characters and settings all look pretty superb, perhaps the best element on show here is the recreation of the film&#x27;s aesthetic — its visual tone, its heightened use of vulgar color, and its unsettling emphasis on the juxtapositioned shadows.
It&#x27;s looking pretty faithful, that&#x27;s for sure. Check out the comparison shots in this new trailer.

As for the game outline itself, it is believed that KKfOS will be a chase-and-fight multiplayer title in the vein of Dead by Daylight, Predator: Hunting Grounds, and the upcoming Texas Chain Saw Massacre. A team of Crescent Cove civilians will take on the Cirque de Puree itself, attempting to prevent the Klown invasion while staying one step ahead of their clumsy gloved hands — lest you end up a ball of cotton candy or a mound of acid cream pie. It&#x27;s a fun idea, and it will be great to see the title in action as it continues along the road to the big top.
Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Interested goofballs can sign up for a future beta over on the official website. In the meantime, read more about the original movie and how it came to fruition right here.

                              <span>She&#x27;s out until November 15
There&#x27;s a massive Overwatch 2 Mei bug afoot, and it&#x27;s going to take some time to fix. How long? Well try November 15.
Here&#x27;s everything Blizzard has shared on the matter, via their official forums:
&quot;We are temporarily disabling Mei to address a bug with her Ice Wall ability that allowed heroes to reach unintended locations when used with their abilities. We are working to address these issues as quickly as possible and aim to bring Mei back in our next upcoming patch which is set for November 15. Thank you for your understanding and patience.&quot;

Mei is the third character that&#x27;s had critical issues in Overwatch 2
Sadly for players who call any number of Overwatch heroes mains: Mei is the third hero since the launch of Overwatch 2 that&#x27;s been taken out of the rotation and put on ice. Previously, Bastion and Torbjorn were removed from play, and now it&#x27;s Mei&#x27;s turn.
I&#x27;m mostly thinking about all of the brand new players who are dealing with the revised system, which requires you to unlock everyone manually like a fighting game. It would be a huge annoyance to finally pick up a character you&#x27;ve been working toward, only to see it disabled because of a bug.

                              <span>Knuckles takes a wrong left turn somewhere
The next Sonic game isn&#x27;t too far off, and today Sega released a video setting the stage for the hedgehog&#x27;s new adventure. A new Sonic Frontiers Prologue video puts the spotlight on what Knuckles has been up to.
This prologue, called Divergence, follows Knuckles as he tends to the Master Emerald on his island. We get a little lore refresher on his backstory, before seeing him make a new discovery on his island.
Some old tech whirs to life after he tinkers with it, and he winds up in a new location. As it turns out, it looks like Knuckles is in a Sonic Frontiers locale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_gjszHTDjzo
While Knuckles can certainly fend for himself, it looks like he&#x27;s not strong enough to hold off this antagonist. Seems like Sonic, and by extension the player, will need to lend a helping hand.
A new frontier
This is one of several lead-in stories, meant to set the stage for Sonic Frontiers. It seems like we&#x27;re dealing with a strange new foe, and that means a little more table-setting than &quot;Eggman&#x27;s at it again.&quot;
Still, we&#x27;re somehow only a week out from the release of the new Sonic game. Revealed at The Game Awards in 2021, Frontiers has been the subject of both curiosity and scrutiny.
We&#x27;ve seen a fair bit of Frontiers already. There are its larger areas to explore and puzzles to solve. And there are some more familiar designs, akin to older Sonic entries.
Whether this new look for Sonic comes together, I just hope Knuckles turns out okay. I don&#x27;t like the look of that Matrix bubble prison one bit.
Sonic Frontiers will launch for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC on November 8.

It&#x27;s an Xbox Game Pass Vampire Survivors kind of month, as the popular arcadey survival game expands its reach to consoles.
Microsoft has unveiled its early-to-mid Xbox Game Pass list, and things are looking pretty good for adventure and sports fans. As for the former, Return to Monkey Island is a standout, but there&#x27;s also two seasons of Walking Dead: A New Frontier, and Michonne. As a reminder, New Frontier is the follow-up to the original Walking Dead first two seasons, continuing the story of Clementine, with newcomer Javi. Football Manager 2023 (both PC and console editions), which is a huge &quot;may as well mess around with this a bit&quot; kind of game, represents the sports world.
Of course, Vampire Survivors on console is a nice get. Despite the cheap price, I can see a lot of on the fence people trying before they buy here.

                              <span>Sam Kerr and Marcus Rashford prove key players
Despite having only launched just one month ago, Electronic Arts&#x27; FIFA 23 has already seen more engagement and playtime than some games can only dream of in their entire lifespan — Not only is the soccer sim the fastest-selling entry in franchise history, but the community has already played some 1.7 billion matches over the course of the past four weeks.
EA Sports noted the bewildering figure in a fun stat sheet pertaining to the new title, which launched on PC and consoles on September 29. According to the figures, over 200 nations have played for a total of 15 billion minutes, scoring 4.3 billion goals across the 1.7 billion matches. The top male goal scorer is Manchester United and England National player Marcus Rashford, while the top female scorer is Chelsea Women&#x27;s Sam Kerr. Kerr also features on the cover of the Ultimate Edition and is the first woman soccer player to do so.

It should also be noted that AFC Richmond has racked up one million match wins to date. Good job, Ted.
FIFA 23 will be the final title in the decades-long franchise to feature joint collaboration between developer Electronic Arts and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) brand. Following a complex (and somewhat bitter) licensing dispute, the two billion-dollar juggernauts decided to part ways in 2021. Electronic Arts&#x27; future soccer sims will retail under the new name of EA Sports FC, while the FIFA organization has stated its intention on developing its own rival soccer series, which it claims will &quot;remain THE BEST&quot;. Hmm.
FIFA 23 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>&quot;Add PVE now, and delete the battle pass system&quot;
An Overwatch 2 survey is rolling out for a number of users, and so far, it&#x27;s a chance for active players to voice their ire for the new systems put in place in the &quot;sequel.&quot;
Shared on the game&#x27;s subreddit, scores of users are reporting that they&#x27;ve obtained an email from Blizzard, asking for feedback for the battle pass and Overwatch Store (read: the cyclical direct payment cosmetic store). As Eurogamer points out, some users are getting different &quot;triggers&quot; for the emails, that range from purchasing content, to not purchasing content. So it seems as if they&#x27;re trying to get an array of feedback from pretty much everyone. As of publication, I personally have not gotten an email yet.
We&#x27;re gonna need a bigger survey
As we&#x27;ve pointed out (particularly in the past week), Overwatch 2 is not running very smoothly post-launch. Some of the microtransactions feel particularly predatory, and one of the first major seasonal events isn&#x27;t up to par.
While the game itself does still mostly feel like Overwatch, the main thing I noticed when first booting it up (and still deal with now) is how busy the game is. The season pass system isn&#x27;t an upgrade, and I&#x27;m particularly worried about future seasons, especially ones that add characters into the mix.
One of the chief issues is that Blizzard, when erasing the original Overwatch and adding this free-to-play scheme, didn&#x27;t really add much value: even for premium season pass owners. Maybe the PVE update will change that, but most of us are wondering when that will even happen (and some of you will be long gone, and won&#x27;t wait that long to find out how it impacts Overwatch 2).

                              <span>Still more questions remain
Kojima Productions has revealed another cast member who will be joining Elle Fanning in the studio&#x27;s as-yet-unrevealed new title — Shioli Kutsuna, perhaps best known for their appearance as Yukio in Deadpool 2, will star in the new game in an as-yet-undisclosed role.
Shioli Kutsuna&#x27;s presence was confirmed in another &quot;headshot&quot; teaser image, which sees the 29-year-old Japanese-Australian actor staring dead-on into the lens, engulfed in red light and emblazoned with the question &quot;Where Am I?&quot;, similar imagery was used to tease the identity, and the eventual reveal of, Elle Fanning, who film fans will recognize from cinema jaunts such as Disney&#x27;s Maleficent and Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s excellent psychological horror The Neon Demon.
Producer Hideo Kojima is yet to spill the beans on the new title, which is believed to be a brand new IP, rather than a follow-up to his studio&#x27;s 2019 release, Death Stranding. Kojima Productions is currently working on the new game in tandem with a sequel to Death Stranding itself. And, given Kojima&#x27;s close relationship with industry pundit Geoff Keighley, it seems likely that we will be hearing more about the mysterious new project at the upcoming Game Awards — currently set to take place on December 8.

                              <span>Over three million consoles moved in last quarter
Sony Interactive Entertainment has released its financial results for fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, which shows that its most recent hardware platform, PlayStation 5 (PS5), has smashed past 25 million global shipments since its initial launch in November 2020.
According to the data, the shiny white behemoth shipped 3.3 million units in the most recent quarter, more or less matching the same period in 2021 and thus presenting steady sales for the (admittedly expensive) hardware. While there have been some struggles getting the ninth generation off to a strong start — impacted by production woes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cost of living crisis — it appears that sales of the PS5 system remain relatively comfortable for the time being.
In addition to the hardware figures, SIE also revealed that there are currently 45.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, though this figure is down some 1.8 million users from the same time frame one year ago. Much like Microsoft&#x27;s the Xbox Game Pass service, it seems that PlayStation is continually struggling to grow its subscriber base, which had seen nothing but growth until the 2021 economy slump. Still, 45 million players is nothing to be sniffed at, and so it is unlikely that the publisher will be too concerned.
Further decline was seen in total game sales, with PS4 and PS5 combined software sales down a huge 13.9 million units over 2021, for a grand total of 62.5 million games sold. 63% of all full game sales were digital purchases — demonstrating that while the digital market continues its inevitable growth, physical media is not quite ready to be consigned to the garbage pile just yet.

The music group successfully thwarted Yout&#x27;s request for a declaration that its service doesnt circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. This was a futile endeavor from the start, the RIAA argues.

                              <span>Copyright holders often write to internet billpayers claiming that their IP addresses have been linked to piracy. They say that billpayers are liable because they pirated content themselves or failed to stop someone else who did. When movie company Voltage Holdings tried to win default judgments against 30 internet subscribers, none of whom were shown to be the actual infringers, a judge refused to comply. In its appeal, Voltage says the judge made the wrong decision.

With 34 seasons, one cinematic release and 28 video games under its belt, you could say that The Simpsons has grown to become kinda popular.
This week marks the 15th anniversary of The Simpsons Game - a title that many of us look back on fondly and, frankly, feel a little sick that 15 years have passed since its release. Such a momentous occasion has got us thinking about all of the other Simpsons titles which have come before it, some of them quality and some of them not so much.

There&#x27;s been a fair number of Switch ports this year alone. Some are surprising, others long-awaited and requested, but every time a game on another system makes its way onto Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, there&#x27;s always a bit of a debate that often leads to a discussion of the Switch 2, Switch Pro — whatever you want to call it.
The Switch is much less powerful than the PS5 or Xbox Series X, and so whenever games from those systems (and even the PS4/Xbox One), there are always lots of questions. How will the game run on Switch? What will it look like? Does the portability override any potential issues?

Kickstarter is becoming home to some of the most interesting video games and projects, especially for those who have grown up playing video games for their whole lives. And the latest project we&#x27;ve spotted, LunarLux, has just reached its stretch goal to come to Switch — and it looks like the Game Boy Advance RPG we never knew we wanted. (Thanks Nintendo Everything!)
The game&#x27;s Kickstarter has been live since 4th October, and is currently over 400% funded with a few more stretch goals to unlock, including a harder difficulty and a super boss!

Just over a week after Blizzard reinstated Torbjörn and Bastion in Overwatch 2, the developer is now having to remove another hero from the game — and she&#x27;ll be gone for two weeks.
Mei&#x27;s Ice Wall has been found to have a bug, which currently other heroes can use to reach &quot;unintended locations&quot; when combined with their own abilities, Community Manager Craig shared over on the Blizzard Forums. Sound pretty useful, maybe a bit too useful for something that&#x27;s intended as a shield.

As the crisp, autumnal leaves cover the ground, and the chilly nights draw in, it&#x27;s the perfect time to snuggle up inside and play something a bit cosier. Harvestella, Square Enix&#x27;s attempt at breaking into the farming sim genre, should fill that gap nicely come this Friday when it launches as a console exclusive on Switch, and the first review for the game has now dropped (thanks, Nintendo Everything!).
This week&#x27;s Famitsu scores have dropped, and Square Enix — in partnership with Live Wire — seems to have grown something quite pleasant, as the publication has awarded the game 8/8/8/7, or 31/40. Not bad at all!

On the 15th anniversary of Super Mario Galaxy&#x27;s release, we&#x27;ve decided to revisit and revamp our all-time Best Super Mario Games article. Previously, we had the plumber&#x27;s 2D and 3D adventures separated into two reader-ranked lists, with this overall uber-list compiled by Nintendo Life staff... but no more!
Now, for your reading pleasure, we have distilled the disparate rankings into a single reader-ranked article covering every single one of Mario&#x27;s mainline platformers across all dimensions. If you&#x27;re interested in our personal opinions, check out our video at the very end of the article.

We said this back in 2016, and we&#x27;ll say it again — a game with a title like Chompy Chomp Chomp Party is pretty hard to ignore. This multiplayer party game launched on the Wii U eShop in 2016, and on 17th November, you&#x27;ll be able to get it on Switch, and it&#x27;s coming with new game modes, more level themes, and a new level pack.
Developed by Utopian World of Sandwiches (another contender for the best game developer name ever), Chompy Chomp Chomp Party allows up to eight players to get together and cause chaos. In the Wii U game, there were three base modes — Chase &amp; Chomp, Keep The Thing, and Zone Dash — but with the Switch release, there will be eight modes available off the bat, with more to come in the future.

                              <span>According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn&#x27;t for Modern Warfare II&#x27;s cast of c…</span>

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Developer Salt &amp; Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That&#x27;s because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror&#x27;s inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you&#x27;ll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there. Check it out in my screenshot below: 
&quot;A preview of the post-apocalyptic drama series based on the critically acclaimed video game,&quot; The Last of Us: Season 1 Sneak Peek&#x27;s description reads. &quot;Premieres January 15.&quot; 
This lines up with what&#x27;s expected of an HBO series, too, as the subscription services&#x27; shows are not usually dropped in bulk, like on Netflix. Instead, HBO sticks to the weekly release popularized with standard television, and that the description says the show simply premieres January 15 means new episodes of The Last of Us will likely release each week. January 15 is also a Sunday, and episodes for HBO&#x27;s biggest shows typically release on Sunday evenings, like House of the Dragon. My money&#x27;s on new episodes of this show dropping each Sunday for however many weeks at 9 p.m. ET. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now if HBO&#x27;s description is correct. 
In the meantime, watch this teaser for HBO&#x27;s The Last of Us and then watch this full trailer for the show. Read about how Marlene actor Merle Dandridge is reprising her role from the game in the show after that and then watch this video about our thoughts on the recent remake of The Last of Us.

Nově vydaná verze rozšiřuje experimentálně podporu i o 64-bit RISC-V ISA a úspěšně prochází RV32IM a RV64IM oficiálními testy, které jsou nyní přidané k již existujícím unit a integračním testům do GitHub automatizace. Stránky projektu najdete na GitHubu. Materiály k výuce architektur počítačů na ČVUT najdete na comparch.edu.cvut.cz včetně online verze (zatím starší 0.9.3) simulátoru spustitelné v prohlížeči.

K dispozici je zde i odkaz na článek a prezentaci z Embedded World Conference 2022. Rozhovor o účasti autorů na výstavě a konferenci Embedded World 2022 byl publikovaný na stránkách studijního programu Otevřená Informatika na ČVUT FEL.

Novou verzi simulátoru a jeho využití ve výuce bude prezentovat Jakub Dupák na DevConf CZ MINI ve čtvrtek 3. listopadu od 17:30 v posluchárně D1 brněnské Masarykovy univerzity. Přednášky by měly být dostupné online i zpětně na streamu.</span>

That included a hotel called the Conservatorium, which is indeed beautiful, but it seems the management is displeased with the building&#x27;s inclusion in the game as a Modern Warfare II map.
As originally reported by Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant (and translated by PC Gamer), the hotel&#x27;s manager Roy Tomassen has released a statement implying that they might take legal action against Activision. &quot;Breenbergh&quot; is the level in question, and features the hotel in both a mu…</span>

Publisher Raw Fury, in association with developer Shedworks, has announced that the critically acclaimed sci-fi adventure Sable will be coming to PS5 next month, following on from its previous release on Xbox and PC platforms in the fall of 2021.
Sable, for those yet to have experienced it, is an ethereal adventure game set within the isolated desert lands of The Midden. Players guide a mysterious protagonist as they venture across the plains and dunes astride a futuristic hoverbike, searching lonely caves, crumbling ruins, and encountering forgotten nomadic civilizations while on a search for their own identity.
You can check out Sable&#x27;s fascinating world and evocative visual style in the trailer below.

Upon release, the title was praised for its enigmatic and open narrative, as well as its striking visuals and beautiful score, composed by artist Japanese Breakfast. The PS5 edition will feature the game in its entirety, with further optimization for the DualSense&#x27; Haptic Feedback technology. In addition, the PS5 version will feature a new fishing mini-game, allowing the player to gather rare breeds of finned wonderment to display in an in-game aquarium. As we all know, it isn&#x27;t a real game without fishing.
Sable will launch on PS5 November 29. It is available right now on PC and Xbox platforms.

Dungeon-crawling RPG Kowloon High School Chronicle is making its way to PC via Steam. Arc System Works is releasing the updated version of the PS2 RPG onto Steam on November 10.
This remastered version has already been released for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Now, PC players will get a chance to check out this older dungeon crawler. The Steam page is live here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HgFfhjaPoZc
Kowloon High School Chronicle first launched for PlayStation 2 in Japan, back in 2004. The new remaster not only brings it to new systems, but adds some revamped graphics.
The set-up of Kowloon is pretty interesting, too. You play a young treasure hunter masquerading as a transfer student. During the day, the player attends class and hangs out with friends, using a novel and slightly bizarre conversation system to foster relationships.
Then at night, the protagonist and their party can venture into the labyrinths and catacombs beneath the school, in pursuit of hidden treasure. This is where it becomes a first-person dungeon crawler, with some pretty neat puzzles.
Daily life of treasure hunters
I&#x27;ve played a solid chunk of the Nintendo Switch version of Kowloon High School Chronicle, and it&#x27;s definitely a different kind of RPG. Between the style, music, and life sim elements, it&#x27;s got a fair bit of Persona in it.
But I&#x27;m also a big fan of crunchy, weird interfaces and old internet UI. I mean, look at this wanted ad from the game&#x27;s in-universe internet.

If you want something offbeat, this might be what you&#x27;re looking for. Especially those of you looking to load up the Steam Deck with RPGs before the holidays.
Kowloon High School Chronicle hits PC via Steam on November 10, and is also currently available on PS4 and Switch.

                              <span>Happy Halloween!
Since E3, I have hit the books on really deeply learning the tarot more than ever. The appearance of the tarot in various video games has always fascinated me. Games like the Persona and Tactics Ogre series have often placed the tarot front and center in meaningful ways, and it&#x27;s also a reason my healer of choice in Final Fantasy XIV is Astrologian.
And thankfully it&#x27;s these games that informed my views and got me reading up, instead of whatever that Twin Flame/Gemini-you-knew-from-high-school-drama-class-is-coming-back-into-your-life crystal-grifting brain rot on TikTok and YouTube is. I like the crystals because they&#x27;re shiny, that&#x27;s it. Sparkly rocks.
Anyway, I&#x27;m back in time for Halloween with more decks of cards and while I could use them for introspective shadow work…</span>

Netflix has announced another games studio acquisition. Cozy Grove developer Spry Fox is joining Netflix.
In an announcement from the studio, Spry Fox says this acquisition will allow for a few things. Firstly, the team will be able to make games they&#x27;ve been making and wanted to make, with more support and resources.
It will also reduce stress on Spry Fox&#x27;s games to generate profit, according to the studio, and give the team access to other creatives at Netflix for collaboration.
&quot;Real talk: we’ve been at this for almost 13 years,&quot; said the Spry Fox team in today&#x27;s statement. &quot;It’s been exhilarating, humbling, endlessly interesting and often challenging. We’ve always known that above all else, we wanted our games to bring people happiness. …</span>

                              <span>It takes place in a haunted version of the Korok Forest
Famous modder Waikuteru is at it again, this time with a Zelda: Breath of the Wild Halloween &quot;DLC&quot; mod that injects some spookiness into the mix, and adds a new questline and major enemy.
It all starts with a quest called &quot;The Halloween Hunt,&quot; which is picked up in the Korok Forest. Apparently the residing Koroks are &quot;in distress,&quot; and it&#x27;s up to you to solve the mystery of the haunted zone and square off against a new foe called the Ghost Rider. If they appear you need to outrun them, or head back to the Korok Forest to get them off your tail. When the appear, the screen goes dark purple, and there&#x27;s a sufficiently scary freak-out sequence.
The gist is that you&#x27;ll embark upon a journey to collect 30 Cursed Pumpkins, which a friendly Korok named Socki can use to make a stew to dispel the magic therein. You&#x27;ll don a spooky outfit for the occasion (which is required to avoid the detection of the aforementioned monster), and the quest has a 30-minute timer on it. Once you&#x27;re finished you can take out the Ghost Rider once and for all!
As usual, everyone involved (including Waikuteru and their friend Sockpoppet, who worked on custom enemies and items for the mod) is a talented bunch: the Zelda: Breath of the Wild modding community is outstanding in terms of scope.

                              <span>&quot;The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.&quot;
God of War Ragnarok transmog (read: the ability to customize the look of your gear without losing its stats) is in! The news comes straight from the game&#x27;s official Discord, where a developer Q&amp;A confirmed it.
While the Q&amp;A was conducted over voice, MP1st managed to get the full transcription, where combat lead Mihir Sheth spilled the beans on God of War Ragnarok transmog:
Q: &quot;Since we’re talking about armor. I like to look good, alright everyone at the studio knows this about me. Fashion first for Kratos, of course. I know one of the request for 2018 was the ability to maybe have the stats you want, but you know, give Kratos the runway look you want. So this is a question from SpiritWolf and a lot of other people; Will there be an armor transmog system?&quot;
Mihir Sheth: &quot;The short answer is yes. There is a way to do it…it’s there in the game.&quot;

The answer is a bit cryptic, and it&#x27;s unclear whether or not it&#x27;s going to be a free-for-all anything goes model (where you can just toggle it), or if it needs to be unlocked/requires a reagent/consumable of some kind. Either way, it&#x27;s confirmed in some form.
At this point with any AAA game with gear, transmog is not only a highly-requested feature, but expected. Games are even adding it after launch because of how many people are requesting it.

                              <span>An adventure classic is being remade from the ground up
Cyan is remaking another one of its classics, this time in Riven. The studio has announced it is developing a Riven remake from the ground up.
Riven, or Riven: The Sequel to Myst, will be getting a full, modern remake. Cyan&#x27;s already produced a remake for Myst, and it seems like this will be a similar undertaking.
In an FAQ online, Cyan addresses the basics. Yes, this is a remake from the ground up, not a remaster. The new Riven remake will also be fully traversable in 3D.
No details on platforms or dates have been announced yet. But this will be a new game, so expect to buy a new product, rather than get it for free if you already have the classic Riven.
As to why Cyan is doing this now, and after 25 years? Here&#x27;s their explanation:
&quot;Riven is one of the most highly regarded games in Cyan’s history. We didn’t want to approach it lightly or frivolously. Cyan is a small indie studio. We wanted to make sure we could take on such a difficult, costly and complicated endeavor – and do it well.&quot;

https://twitter.com/cyanworlds/status/1587065601339424770
Remaking the sequel to Myst
There was also a fan project in the works, the Starry Expanse Project, to remake Riven. Alongside news of the remake, Cyan confirms that project has been ceased development. The Starry Expanse team continues to exist, independent from Cyan, though the two teams collaborated early on to kickstart the official remake development, according to Cyan&#x27;s letter. One member of the Starry Expanse team has also been hired by Cyan.
&quot;So for the first time publicly, we are happy to report that our effort to remake Riven officially here at Cyan is alive and well, and it was helped by the Starry Expanse team’s years of effort, enabling us to begin the huge task of rebuilding Riven from scratch,&quot; said Cyan. &quot;With a very focused development team here at Cyan, Riven is well on its way to being reborn!&quot;

This year, I both succeeded and started early. And now, I’m sick of them. I don&#x27;t want any more monsters or grungy aesthetics. I’m tired of some dude with a knife getting in my way while I try to slot crests in their respective crest-holes.
I’m so tired of keys. I don&#x27;t even lock my door anymore... Okay, maybe one more.
Part of this initial flood of horror titles has been through Puppet Combo’s publisher label, Torture Star Video. Stay Out of the House is pure Puppet Combo. Guy’s been working on this one for a while, and it’s finally here. So, at least if I’m forcing myself to swallow one more morsel into…</span>

                              <span>The deal kicks off with the upcoming Iron Man game
EA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.
The deal was first reported today by Bloomberg, followed by an announcement from EA. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on &quot;at least three&quot; new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.
These games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was recently confirmed to be working on an Iron Man game.
&quot;At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,&quot; said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. &quot;We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their Iron Man video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.&quot;

A Marvel-ous deal
EA has a history with the Star Wars series already. Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have done pretty well. Well enough, in fact, that Respawn&#x27;s working on several more Star Wars projects.
With a Marvel deal locked in, it looks like Electronic Arts is deepening its ties to Disney properties.
The Marvel universe isn&#x27;t just stopping there, though. Skydance recently teased its upcoming Captain America-Black Panther project. (Skydance is also working on a Star Wars project.)
Plus, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is just around the corner in December. And Marvel Snap is gradually taking over everyone&#x27;s phones. The Marvel games roll-out just keeps growing.

The Core i5 13600K is a 14-core / 20-thread processor (6 P cores + 8 E cores), up from 6 P cores + 4 E cores with the prior generation Core i5 12600K. The Core i5 13600K has a recommended customer price of $319~329, which is indeed being honored among Internet retailers and with robust availability.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is a good gaming CPU with better content creation performance than the more expensive 5800X3D - even though it&#x27;s slower than the X3D in gaming. Still, at its price point it hits a punch, and the boffins at HUKD have spotted a good deal for the 5800X at CCL. There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. 
The way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that&#x27;s more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand.

                              <span>Logitech makes some of the best mainstream racing wheels and pedals on the market, but the cost of entry is still fairly steep: £269 for the PC/PlayStation-compatible G29 and the same for the PC/Xbox G920 variant. Today though, Currys in the UK are offering £80 off on either model when you use code WHEEL80, dropping the price down to £189.

The game is structured into four square panels in a two-by-two grid. Players can move around each of the squares to solve puzzles or click inside each square to interact with the scene. This is where it gets cool: Any object you see that has some sort of frame around it - doorways, paintings, windows, photographs - you can actually move through them and discover new areas to explore.

                              <span>Canny Overwatch 2 players have reported more success in obtaining skins by grinding for in-game gold in Blizzard’s long-running fantasy MMO World Of Warcraft and converting that into Battle.net balance than by completing weekly challenges in the hero shooter itself. The trick involves trading gold farmed in WOW for tokens that convert to Battle.net balance, which can then be spent on Overwatch 2 cosmetics. It’s a cunning ploy that speaks volumes about player frustration with the multiplayer shooter’s new free to play mechanics, a situation that might still change if Blizzard listen to results of a recent survey.

                              <span>Immortality developer Sam Barlow has spoken about being contacted by electric car manufacturer Tesla for the opportunity to put interactive movie Her Story into their vehicles for no compensation other than “exposure”. Barlow’s comments emerged on Twitter in response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media platform, specifically, the suggestion that Twitter users may soon have to pay for blue tick verified status.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s lead hero designer has revealed Blizzard are working on new support heroes for the game as one of their “long-term focuses”. The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It&#x27;s not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.

                              <span>Look, it&#x27;s all well and good wanting to get scared on Halloween or whatever. But some of us live the horror life every day of the year. We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there&#x27;s no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?
I know common wisdom considers Halloween to be &quot;Goth Christmas&quot;, but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine&#x27;s Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I&#x27;m determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday &quot;Goth Valentine&#x27;s&quot;. Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.

                              <span>Putting together this list of the best early Black Friday SSD deals has proven trickier than expected, and not because Black Friday is still three weeks away. It’s because so many SSDs are subjected to dirty retailer tricks, mainly raising prices for the sole purpose of dropping them back down and calling it a “deal”. Naw, sir, not falling for that. What you’ll find here, then, are SSD offers with genuine discounts only – and with both lightspeed-fast NVMe SSDs and affordable SATA SSDs on early sales, there&#x27;s something for all kinds of PC builds.

                              <span>Horror games, you say? Feh, hardware can be scary too. One time I turned on a power supply and it literally went up in a cloud of smoke. Last year I cut my hand on a CPU cooler radiator. And did you see how dusty my PC was before I cleaned it? That’s basically body horror.
Apparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.

The Conservatorium Hotel, a five-star gaff that describes itself as the “living room of Amsterdam” on its website, hasn’t taken too kindly to being shot to pieces in digital form. Despite a name change, it’s still recognisably the same establishment.

                              <span>I am, generally speaking, a horror fan, but this year for Halloween I&#x27;ve niched down on a particular topic and it has sort of accidentally taken me away from horror. Hm. Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they&#x27;re one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.
It makes sense. They&#x27;ve already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I&#x27;ve collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I&#x27;ve not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).

                              <span>As part of the game’s 1.05 patch, DC bad boy Black Adam finally joins the roster of fighters in Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus today. Adam is a bruiser and launches with an unlockable skin modelled after his classic comic book look, which nabs players extra candy during the Halloween event running through to the end of Multiversus’s first season on November 15th. Today’s 1.05 update sees an arcade mode added to the game too, along with a new casual Growth Spurt mode.

                              <span>The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.
If you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.

I&#x27;m currently competing for the title of trickster-in-chief here at RPS, and I&#x27;m never going to have a chance of receiving this promotion unless I reach my daily scare quota. If only there was a way I could package together a collection of scary stories as told my colleagues and claim them all as my own.

Aha! I got you again! They don&#x27;t call me the Merry Trickster Of UK PC Gaming Websites for nothing! You&#x27;ve been Halloween&#x27;d, my friends! To celebrate spooky season, I gathered seven members of the RPS treehouse to tell me about one moment from a PC game that scared them the most. The results were exactly as I expected. Some recounted events in classic horror games that shocked them senseless, whereas others told me anecdotes about games that most wouldn&#x27;t consider scary at all. The result is seven tales of spooks that are sure to chill your bones this All Hallows&#x27; Eve.

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

This news comes as a surprise considering how devoted Cavill has seemed to the role over the years, quickly becoming a fan-favorite after the release of Season 1. He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth&#x27;s casting in the role. 
&quot;My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,&quot; Cavill&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

The site&#x27;s userbase is growing rapidly, in part helped by TikTok users&#x27; viral videos. Following a recent complaint from the Authors Guild, TikTok has banned the hashtag  #zlibrary pending further review. But will that help?

This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

One might&#x27;ve expected this to lead to an explosion in piracy traffic, but that&#x27;s not the case. While there was still plenty of interest, most pirates waited for the &#x27;official&#x27; release.

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

It includes a look at all the exclusive bonuses PlayStation players get for playing the game on that platform, too, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.

While those are large, long-coveted features, a new trailer focuses on a couple of smaller additions: two new multiplayer maps, and a new mode, Covert One Flag. And one of the maps looks particularly lovely.

Today, Frontier called the situation &quot;crossed wires&quot;, and said that there are &quot;multiple updates currently in the pipeline, focused on addressing the most important topics raised by the community.&quot;

                              <span>Having recently complained about managing traffic in building games, it is only natural and right that I now praise one that is entirely about managing traffic.
I&#x27;ve had an eye on All Quiet Roads for months, but between Tile Cities and Blink Planets it seemed a bit much to throw this recommendation at you as well. But a game exclusively about the thing I hate most holding my interest this well has to be respected. All Quiet Roads also balances relaxing, freeform play with stressful, occasionally overwhelming challenges, giving it a tonal variety that I wasn&#x27;t really expecting from such a simple concept.

                              <span>Stress Level Zero&#x27;s Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.
Then Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you&#x27;d need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn&#x27;t quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It&#x27;s also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.

                              <span>My strongest memory from my 100-hour-long first playthrough of Horizon Zero Dawn was the first time I took on a Thunderjaw. A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I&#x27;d seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: &quot;I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.&quot;
My second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. &quot;Oh shite. Here we go.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a very big enjoyer of horror games. On the very rare occasion that I do boot up a horror game, a chemical change seems to occur in my body. The part of my brain responsible for going &quot;holy mother of hell get me away from this scary thing&quot; is dampened. I expect to be scared, and therefore I&#x27;m more resilient to said scariness. I might just not be very good at getting into the horror games mindset. My brain is too busy battening down all the hatches and readying the engines of war against the oncoming spookies and ghosties.
The times I&#x27;ve been most scared playing a game are when I don&#x27;t expect to be scared. And what better way to lull myself into a false sense of security this Halloween than to play an otherwise not-so-scary game, with just one particularly horror-esque moment?

The latest deep dive trailer details the game’s magical parkour abilities that you’ll be using to get across the fantasy realm of Athia. Forspoken’s flashy, stamina-based movement is by far the most distinctive thing about it in my eyes, so let&#x27;s take a look at Frey&#x27;s parkour abilities below.

                              <span>Early last week, I had the opportunity to get hands-on with the demo for The Devil In Me, the upcoming fourth entry and season one finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology. I&#x27;m a big Dark Pictures fan, but had some reservations about this latest outing due to its subject matter, which this time around draws more inspiration from real-life serial killers than supernatural legends. Still, by the end of my 90 minutes or so with the game, my feelings had evolved considerably, and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m now way more excited for it than I was. In fact, I think this could easily end up as the best Dark Pictures game yet.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s arctic scientist Mei has had a notable bug in her toolkit since launch, but the problem is becoming more persistent for some players. All of Mei’s abilities revolve around ice, whether slowing down enemies with a snowy spray or incubating in a cocoon of ice.

                              <span>CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer spoke about the possibility of price increases for consoles, games and Game Pass at the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s annual Tech Live conference (thanks to The Verge for transcribing.) &quot;We&#x27;ve held price on our console, we&#x27;ve held price on games and our subscription. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to do that forever,&quot; Spencer admits. &quot;I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise some prices on certain things.&quot; He was quick to point out, though, that these changes wouldn&#x27;t come into effect this holiday season, as Microsoft wants to &quot;maintain the prices that we have.&quot;

                              <span>I’m extremely picky with my mobile games. Since its launch in 2019, Apple Arcade has spoiled me so thoroughly with its beautifully crafted, ad-free experience that it’s hard to go back to anything else. To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap. I downloaded it a few days ago and haven’t put it down since.
Marvel Snap is a free-to-play deck-builder with very short matches (usually only three to four minutes). As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability.

                              <span>Remakes tend to be more exciting than remasters because the improvements often go beyond mere bumps in resolution or framerate. At best, studios reimagine classic experiences in exciting new ways, sand away rough edges, and somehow retain the intangible x-factors that made fans fall in love with these titles in the first place. At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. 
The remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works. Thankfully, we’ve gathered as many of the announced remakes (not remasters) that we could find and gathered them in one neat list, arranged chronologically by release window.

Tiny Roar describes the game as a &quot;soothing and zany building and exploration game where you place tiles to expand your world with small adventures and big surprises for your characters to uncover.&quot; Using these tiles, you can create a &quot;unique story-multiverse&quot; at your own pace. If you want to play fast and loose, you can; if you want to play it strategically, laying out every tile in such a way that your story plan goes off flawlessly, you can do that too, it seems.

                              <span>Paranormal Tales is an upcoming indie horror game with a unique perspective twist. Players experience the first-person adventure through the lens of a body camera to provide a more realistic, claustrophobic trek into its terrifying world. 
The game, created by two designers, draws inspiration from found footage films. The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy. Expect to encounter some very creepy phenomena, and the realistic graphics (rendered in Unreal Engine 5) aim to sell the bodycam perspective effectively. Check out the trailer below if you&#x27;re looking to raise a few hairs.


Paranormal Tales has no release window and has only been confirmed for PC so far. What do you think of the bodycam style in video games? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese version has been canceled due to the game&#x27;s violent content and the rating it received in Japan, or lack thereof, as a result. 
This news comes from The Callisto Protocol&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account, which reveals that the game could not achieve an age rating with CERO (which is Japan&#x27;s equivalent to the United States&#x27; ESRB rating). As a result, it cannot be allowed to release as is in the country. Here&#x27;s what the studio had to say, as translated by Eurogamer. 


&quot;The Callisto Protocol has decided to stop the release of the Japanese version. As of now, the CERO rating cannot be passed. We have decided that we would no longer be able to provide you with the experience you need. We hope everyone in Japan will understand. If you have already preordered, we will refund you.&quot;

As you can see, The Callisto Protocol will not be releasing in Japan as it seems Striking Distance does not want to change or edit the content of its game to fall more in line with CERO ratings. Given how terrifying Japanese horror can be, it seems The Callisto Protocol is cooking up something scary.

                              <span>Somerville, the mysterious sci-fi adventure game, finally has a release date and it’s only a few weeks away. The game arrives on November 15. 
The experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.


Somerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December&#x27;s Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.</span>

                              <span>Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. 
Nick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive Mini II, there&#x27;s a message that reads, &quot;In memory of Rieko Kodama.&quot; Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe&#x27;s tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, &quot;As you understand it. We respected her,&quot; confirming her death. 
Sega has since confirmed Kodama&#x27;s death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family&#x27;s privacy, Sega says. 
&quot;We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,&quot; Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. 
Kodama&#x27;s journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series&#x27; visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.
Other credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega&#x27;s Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. 
In 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. 
The staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama&#x27;s family.</span>

Unfortunately, it also temporarily squashed the Batman game’s Denuvo DRM protections, seemingly leaving it vulnerable to pirates. That’s one way to take them by…

                              <span>Around 24 hours ago, Gotham Knights on Steam received its first patch. Among fixes for was various bugs, the game was also updated to remove Denuvo&#x27;s anti-tamper DRM from the game. Sometimes games remove their DRM after the launch window, but not normally just five days after release, making its removal from Gotham Knights a surprise. 

Well, now Denuvo has been re-added.

The Ryzen 5600X costs the best part of £200, but the vanilla 5600 is down to £145 at Ebuyer - a great value in my book.

This is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I&#x27;ve never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.
That is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.

                              <span>Today has brought the launch of Signalis, a new retro-styled survival horror about an android trapped in a spooky place in deep space. It looks neat! I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s good! I can neither confirm nor deny that because I can&#x27;t get past the main menu. The background is a big blinking eye, see, and it follows my mouse cursor, so I cannot resist making the eye look around and go silly. I don&#x27;t know how the devs expected players to beat this near-impossible first task of leaving the eye alone long enough to click the &quot;Begin&quot; button.

Grounded has its main quest and Minecraft has the Ender Dragon, for example, which gives you something to work towards past simply keeping your heart beating. 7 Days to Die is the biggest counterpoint to that, with its routine weekly horde attacks delivering moreish gameplay that keeps me playing way past my bedtime.

                              <span>Wanna get into the Halloween spirit but are a bit of a wimp (100% guilty), or just struggle with horror games in general (1000% guilty)? No worries; I got you. Here&#x27;s a list of the best spooky games for non-horror fans.
Don’t get me wrong, I love Halloween,  I just don’t want to have the bejesus scared outta me, you know? I like games that give me a lil bit of spooky-ookiness, but not like bone-chilling, stomach-churning, nightmare inducing, wont-sleep-for-a-week horror games. Absolutely not. You won’t find any Resident Evil or Silent Hill recommendations here! Feel safe knowing that the spooky-not-scary games you&#x27;ll find below will get you thoroughly into the Halloween mood, just without all the over-the-top violence and buckets of gore. Enjoy!

                              <span>Apex Legends: Eclipse, the 15th season of Respawn&#x27;s peerless battle royale, is nearly upon us. We&#x27;ve already seen quite a bit about Broken Moon, the brand new map being added with Season 15 - but now Respawn has finally released more details about the new Legend, Catalyst, and the Ferrofluid-powered abilities she brings to the Apex Games.
It turns out that part of Catalyst&#x27;s diverse skillset is an Ultimate ability that may at last provide some serious counterplay to the ever-present scan meta dominated by recon Legends such as Bloodhound and Seer. Take a look at Catalyst&#x27;s abilities in the new Season 15 vignette trailer below.

                              <span>Saturnalia isn&#x27;t a terribly long game, but it has spent much longer occupying my thoughts. Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I&#x27;d heard a strange rattling noise...
In fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they&#x27;re locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.

                              <span>Happy skeleton war month, ya filty animals! This week on the Electronic Wireless Show we talk about dread, as in, the thing Matthew feels when confronted with glistening food, or when he knows he has to record a podcast with us. We talk about some cracking scary games, going a bit down the beaten track and away from our normal path of least resistance (talking about Red Dead Redemption 2 and BioWare games). We also have some spooky recommendations for you to spice up your Halloween! Plus, it&#x27;s Nate turn to produce a Cavern Of Lies. More like Cavern Of Jump Scares! And we coin a couple of new euphemisms you&#x27;re sure to work into your every day language.

                              <span>A little while back, I went to Cornwall with some friends in the hopes we&#x27;d detox on lovely beaches and coastal walks. Somehow, we managed a mental cleanse between horrendous downpours that knocked us sideways and made our socks all soggy. And while we cocooned ourselves in metal and waited for these bouts of terrible weather to subside, we played disgusting amounts of Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla.
Over the course of a couple of weeks, we racked up a solid 60+ hours of game time. I&#x27;d wake up and see my friend clearing map markers. I&#x27;d pop out for a quick run (yes, I ran on my holiday like a chump) and return to see both of my friends clearing map markers. Did we enjoy it? Sometimes! But then, why couldn&#x27;t we stop playing? The Ubisoft Effect, I reckon.

A mysterious little city trapped in a time loop, where you slowly learn all the secrets but no one remembers what you did last time around. That&#x27;s The Forgotten City, and if you&#x27;re on Game Pass, I do recommend having a go before it leaves Microsoft&#x27;s service next week. It&#x27;s a great puzzle box running to clockwork, like if Outer Wilds had you meddle with people&#x27;s lives rather than machinery.

He does have a fairly good reason for it, though. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Martin said, “I have not played it because people seem to want this Winds Of Winter book,” the (very) long-awaited sixth chapter in the Game Of Thrones series.

                              <span>BioWare have announced, via a blog post by general manager Gary McKay, that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the fourth game in their fantasy RPG series, has completed its Alpha milestone. If that means nothing to you, BioWare describe it as the moment “a game all comes together… we can experience the entire game, from the opening scenes of the first mission to the very end.” The Dragon Age sequel was officially announced in 2018, but it was initially conceived as a game about wizard heists before restarting development.

                              <span>The last Frog Detective game is here, marking the end of an era for everyone&#x27;s favourite amphibian-based mystery game series. Our froggy pal has saved a haunted island from the clutches of ghosts, thwarted wizardous party-poopers in Warlock Woods, and now their investigatory prowess has taken him to the wild west. Frog Detective 3: Corruption At Cowboy County may be the last in Worm Club&#x27;s trio of Frog Detective games, but it&#x27;s also a certified banger, successfully joining the first and second games in putting a stupid smile on my face for the entire time I played.

                              <span>38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it&#x27;s particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that&#x27;s why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let&#x27;s quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it&#x27;s a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one of the top contenders that runs on cheap and widely available AM4 motherboards with DDR4 RAM. Earlier this week we covered a deal for the 5800X3D in the US, and now we&#x27;re back to finish the job with a deal for the UK market. 
Right now Ebuyer are taking orders for the 5800X3D at £349, a solid £110 discount from its UK RRP. A lot of folks have already jumped on this deal, using up Ebuyer&#x27;s existing stock, but you can order now for delivery on October 31st - and get a spooky Halloween upgrade for your PC.

                              <span>Hello again. Now that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the second one) is out in full, not just its campaign, I’ve revisited my best settings guide to see whether it can provide a preset-beating balance of looks and performance in the multiplayer component as well. And it does! If anything the various online modes tend to run more smoothly and consistently than the singleplayer story, but whichever you prefer playing, you can make just a few key changes to visibly improve your frames per second. And a COD with more frames just feels better.
Despite this universal truth, MW2 can be a toughie on older PC hardware: even graphics cards listed among the recommended system requestions need quality cuts to get a stable 60fps at 1080p. In this guide I’ll be showing you how various GPUs perform and where, precisely, the make those cuts if needed.

                              <span>I’m fairly sure that zombies are the perfect video game enemies. They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I&#x27;ve put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have the greatest understanding of how one is meant to play a real-time strategy game as a child. It wasn&#x27;t a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I&#x27;d had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I&#x27;d amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I&#x27;d tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

The “full-fledged” remake of 2007’s RPG is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and will use the same toolsets that CDPR is creating for their upcoming Witcher trilogy. The studio call the project a “modern reimagining” and say they’re “updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it.”

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of talking about The Callisto Protocol this year, starting with the game&#x27;s gore system and spiky walls at Summer Geoff Fest, before finding out its Die Hard and Shaun Of The Dead inspirations at Gamescom. In-between all the talking? Lots of slides and presentations and absolutely no hands anywhere near controllers. But finally, finally, I&#x27;ve played a 90-minute PS5 demo of The Callisto Protocol and can confirm that it felt like a last-gen game in a good way: all photorealistic sweat and blood scrawled on walls, coupled with 360-era exploration and fighting. Refreshingly familiar, I&#x27;d say.

                              <span>To celebrate Fallout&#x27;s 25th anniversary this week, Amazon Prime Video have released the first official glimpse of their upcoming Fallout TV show. Amazon posted a screengrab from the show on Twitter last night, depicting three Vault 33 dwellers staring at a silhouette coming in or out of the Vault - and what appears to be a body lying on the ground beside them. This is the first and only proper look we&#x27;ve had at the adaptation since August’s leaked set images mysteriously disappeared from the internet, but that hasn’t stopped fans from wildly theorising about what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>After the past three years, I’d have happily never heard the word &quot;plague&quot; again, let alone in the context of one of my favourite co-op games. Yet after an early play around with Deep Rock Galactic Season 3, I’m already sold that this update – which centers around a corrupting, planet-wide infection – could be its best one yet.
After repelling a robot-spamming rival corp across Seasons 1 and 2, your reward in Season 3 – which launches on November 3rd – is to find your mining operating pelted by a meteorite storm. And they’re carrying a nasty payload: Rockpox, a contagion that quickly infects both the caves of Hoxxes IV and the many, many giant bugs living within them. These sickly Glyphids and contaminated caverns will present you and your fellow space dwarves with some new perils, but also new opportunities to turn a management-pleasing profit. And isn’t providing value to shareholders why we’re all here to begin with?

Still, this is science, and I respect the process. Next up, I am asking you to choose between two things which, if we&#x27;re honest with ourselves, are both really about trying to be cool.

It’s what should be scary about zombies when they’re not just mindless headshot fodder. This is also the main fear behind Endoparasitic, a top-down horror game released earlier this week. A research facility suffers a parasitic outbreak, leaving you with one arm, surrounded by mutated monsters. Oh, and you’re also infected by one of those deadly parasites I just mentioned. Jolly!

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s campaign may be the best it&#x27;s been for a long while. There&#x27;s great variety in the game&#x27;s first-person shooty bang with plenty of interesting ideas to break the illusion of it being an on-the-rails ride. Where it excels is in its action movie sequences, but it also takes itself too seriously at times and struggles to balance the sensitivities of conflict within its choppy story.

The rebuttal admits that using popular artists to showcase its technology wasn&#x27;t smart so the references have been removed. However, the services themselves are not infringing. In fact, one of the core algorithms is created and publicly shared by  Deezer.

In response, an impressive 15% decided to go legal, but others weren&#x27;t so readily converted. Close to half migrated to other pirate sites, with around 12% of blocked pirates deploying VPNs or modified DNS settings.

                              <span>Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio&#x27;s upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they&#x27;re leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line.

One of those Witcher games was given the codename &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; and CDPR called it a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool&#x27;s Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool&#x27;s Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur&#x27;s Gate III, and Outriders.

                              <span>Team Ninja has revealed the release date for its upcoming action game set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and it&#x27;s less than half a year away. 
More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That&#x27;s less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let&#x27;s break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition
The steelbook launch edition of the game will include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a collector&#x27;s steelbook (yet to be revealed), and the Crown of Zhurong and Crown of Gonggong bonus DLC. It will also include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Digital Deluxe Edition
The digital deluxe edition will include a digital copy of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a digital art book, a digital mini soundtrack, and the game&#x27;s season pass. It will also include the Quinglong armor as a season pass bonus, the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus, and the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus. 
DLC
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will have a season pass and it will include three pieces of DLC, although Team Ninja has not detailed what to expect just yet. You can also buy these DLCs individually. Anyone that purchases the season pass will get the Qinglong armor as a bonus.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a &quot;gonzo, crazy, funny adventure&quot; and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

                              <span>Bethesda revealed Arkane Studios&#x27; open-world, co-op FPS Redfall back in 2021, and since then, the companies have been slowly pulling back the curtain on what to expect in this vampire-infested experience. We&#x27;ve received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we&#x27;ve even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new &quot;Into The Night&quot; Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there&#x27;s a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today&#x27;s trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it&#x27;d be such a great Halloween game – but it&#x27;s not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it&#x27;s released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s third chapter, it&#x27;s operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they&#x27;re running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It&#x27;s loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin&#x27; and hollerin&#x27; the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you&#x27;re staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…</span>

                              <span>Cult of the Lamb was released back in August and while the main story will run you a dozen or so hours, developer Massive Monsters are inviting you back to your base of operations with a new Blood Moon Festival update that&#x27;s now live. 
This limited-time event began yesterday (October 24) and will run until November 10. It brings plenty of new with it, too, so you&#x27;ll want to jump in to check out all of the Blood Moon&#x27;s offerings before it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s what to expect:
New Blood Moon Ritual
3 New Follower Forms to unlock
4 Base Decorations to unlock
New music track
To accompany the news, Massive Monsters have also released a new trailer for Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Blood Moon Festival update that you can watch below: 


&quot;Under the light of the Blood Moon, devotees can harvest pumpkins to unlock a brand new ritual that will raise former members of their cult, casting them back to the land of the living as wandering spirits,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;New follower forms and dreadful decorations will be granted upon their capture, but be quick about it, the Blood Moon will wane on November 10.&quot;

                              <span>One of Overwatch&#x27;s most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game&#x27;s loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year&#x27;s event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game&#x27;s Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

&quot;Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,&quot; a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. &quot;Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o&#x27;-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.&quot; 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

Grande, meanwhile, notes that the article was valuable enough to be documented by Warner&#x27;s anti-piracy expert.

The Pepper’s ghost illusion wowed the theatre-going public in the 1860s, spawning a slew of ghost-themed plays. With this project, you can create your own version […]

The Federal Court previously issued orders targeting IPTV and NHL streaming sources and last week, a new piracy-blocking order was handed down. It requires local ISPs to prevent subscribers from accessing pirated streams of the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

                              <span>PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games&#x27; &quot;immoral&quot; compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor&#x27;s original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor&#x27;s thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels &quot;the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry&quot; since &quot;some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger.&quot;

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication.
