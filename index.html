Oh geez High on Life. You know, like, on one hand I&#x27;m keen on the whole &quot;Justin Roiland voice&quot; shtick, especially when it comes to Solar Opposites. But oh man....on the other....it&#x27;s getting a little old, you know? Especially if most people in those worlds feel like they&#x27;re just riffing, like everything is a stream of consciousness...like we&#x27;re all just...part of one big galactic party that never ends? Like how Shrek was mostly just a series of riffs from the actors, and a lot of it didn&#x27;t work? Look it up! On...Wikipedia...or Bing...or something.

Anyway, yeah, a lot of the Roiland shtick does still make me laugh, but there isn&#x27;t a strong enough game around it to really hold up High on Life.

Xbox Head of Gaming Phil Spencer raised eyebrows this weekend with sharp remarks aimed at rivals Sony PlayStation — In an interview with the Second Request podcast, Spencer opined that the way PlayStation grows its brand is by shrinking the perceived size of the Xbox zeitgeist.
&quot;Sony is trying to protect its dominance on the console. The way they grow is by making Xbox smaller,&quot; said Spencer (as noted by VGC). &quot;[Sony] has a very different view of the industry than we do. They don&#x27;t ship their games day and date on PC, they do not put their games into their subscription [service] when they launch their games.&quot;
Spencer&#x27;s candid comments come at a particularly stressful time for the Xbox brand, which continues to hit wall after wall in pare…</span>

Teased during the OG Unwrapped Presentation earlier this year, Outright Games has now announced that it will be bringing DC&#x27;s Justice League: Cosmic Chaos to the Switch for some family-friendly fun on 10th March, 2023.
If you were to look at the state of the DCEU at the moment, the phrase &#x27;family friendly&#x27; might not immediately spring to mind. You&#x27;ve got several iterations of Batman beating seven shades out of criminals, two attempts at a Justice League movie which are better off forgotten and projects being cancelled left, right and centre. Nonetheless, PHL Collective and Outright Games have looked at this landscape and and decided that a family-friendly open-world adventure is the way to go - fair enough!

We seem to be learning more and more about Super Mario Bros. The Movie each day, with official announcements, regional differences and leaks contributing to the growing mound of material. The latest addition to join the pile is a McDonald&#x27;s advert - reportedly showing in Portugal - which contains brand new footage of a much more capable looking Mario in action (thanks, Nintenduo).
The latest advert (below) appears to have been pulled straight out of the early 2000s, it is true, but it does provide a first look at what Mario might be like once he gains a better understanding of his abilities. Here hurdling a Toad before wall jumping up a set of item boxes to avoid the pearly whites of a trio of Piranha Plants, this isn&#x27;t the Mario-in-training that we have seen in the past few trailers but one that appears a lot more ready to get let&#x27;s-a-go-ing.

                              <span>ACTIVATING COMBAT MODE.
In the mid-2000s, Nintendo may have easily dominated the handheld gaming space with the DS and its incredible lineup, but never let it be said that the PSP didn’t have its fair share of absolute bangers. One of the most memorable PSP titles was Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core, a prequel to one of the greatest games Square’s ever managed to produce. Mixing fast-paced hack ‘n’ slash combat with a story that was just as endearing and heartbreaking as the original Final Fantasy VII, Crisis Core quickly built a strong reputation for itself. Now that Square is in the process of, uh, redoing Final Fantasy 7, the developer has seen fit to bring Crisis Core to modern audiences to bring them up to speed on certain plotlines and characters ahead of the launch of Rebirth next winter. We’re pleased to report that this remake has been a resounding success; Crisis Core was always a great game and now it looks and plays better than ever.
Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion, to give it its full title, places you in the role of Zack Fair, a peppy, cocky, and impressively skilled mercenary working for a paramilitary group called SOLDIER, which exists to maintain the interests of the hegemonic Shinra Electric Power Company. Though Shinra is of course the nefarious, puppy-kicking megacorporation you’d expect it to be, Zack genuinely dreams of being a ‘hero’ and wants to do the right thing. His world starts to unravel, however, when a high-level SOLDIER operative named Genesis goes rogue and takes a stand against Shinra. What follows is an increasingly bizarre journey into a world of aliens, clones, and genetic modification that somehow manages to stay coherent and alluring all the way through.

Here&#x27;s a lovely bit of news to kickstart your week: the first six Final Fantasy games have been rated for the Nintendo Switch by the ESRB.
While nothing has been officially announced at the time of writing, this is presumably the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster set, which originally released on mobile devices back in 2021 before making its way to PC. Fans have since been clamouring for a console release and now it looks like Square Enix might be about to answer our prayers.

                              <span>Hot Ones&#x27; got nothing on this.
Our lovely video producer Zion is back once again with a hefty shopping haul, showcasing his uh... let&#x27;s say varied taste in games.
At the top of the pile is a rather curious Japanese titled released in 2020 called Tabe-O-Ja, which is essentially a cooking game in which you summon creatures called &quot;Tabe-Gami&quot;. The package itself comes with some NFC cards, a Joy-Con add-on device, and perhaps most interestingly, a bottle of hot sauce (not actual hot sauce, although the first publisher that includes some hot sauce with an upcoming game gets a thumbs up from us). It&#x27;s a bizarre game, and you should really check out the video below for a proper look at what&#x27;s included.

Update #2 : After hearing from the lead developer of The Outbound Ghost last week, publisher Digerati has now responded with a full statement regarding the game&#x27;s release, including legal action following lawsuit threats from Conradical Games.
In a complaint registered with The U.S. District Court, Digerati has stated that the developer has &quot;trampled&quot; on the team&#x27;s contractual rights and it is therefore opening a lawsuit to order Conradical to &quot;perform its obligations under the Licensing Agreement to ensure the success of The Outbound Ghost.&quot;

Netflix&#x27;s animated series Sonic Prime is mere days away from its premiere, launching this week on December 15th.
To whet your appetite, a new clip from the show has been released on the &#x27;Netflix After School&#x27; YouTube channel to showcase one of Sonic&#x27;s first encounters with an alternate reality version of Tails. After Sonic saves Tails from an approaching vehicle, he recounts how the two originally met and became friends, after which Tails gives an alternate take on his &quot;origin&quot; story. Both versions of the tale showcase retro pixel art visuals similar to the original Sonic games, which - while lacking some of the platformers&#x27; character and charm - is a lovely little touch.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok reclaims its crown.
The latest UK boxed charts are here and it&#x27;s a familiar scene for many, with no new entries into the top ten for this week (Cuphead&#x27;s physical release came in at number eighteen, with the Switch version making up 79% of the copies sold).
God of War Ragnarok reclaimed the crown to come in at number one, climbing up two spots from last time, which GamesIndustry attributes to an increase in PS5 stock for the UK. Meanwhile, FIFA 23 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II slip down one spot each, with sales down 18% and 14% respectively. The Switch version of FIFA 23 continues to perform moderately well, making up 24% of the total split between platforms.

                              <span>Paper Mario-style indie RPG The Outbound Ghost has been delisted from Steam, following lead developer Conrad Grindheim issuing a statement that claimed his relationship with publisher Digerati had &quot;dissolved&quot;. Grindheim posted a video to YouTube and Twitter that alleged the publisher’s recent business practices towards the game haven’t been “ethically correct”. Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

A copyright lawsuit filed by the studios in 2021 was a clear sign that patience had finally run out and a year later, it&#x27;s all over. A California court has just awarded the plaintiffs $20.7m in damages plus $417,600 to cover attorneys&#x27; fees.

The third time really is the charm for the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass. After two perfectly fine, if not wildly amazing, track packs, Nintendo has managed to put together a wave of DLC that is eight tracks, zero skips, swear to God. Not only are these top-tier tracks from Mario Kart&#x27;s past and present, but this is the first time the developers have really tried to lean into the gameplay innovations of Mario Kart 8, i.e., the anti-gravity mechanic. In revisiting these tracks, the developers have deftly added this feature where they can, even if it&#x27;s just for a moment. None of the tracks here follow the footsteps of Wave 2&#x27;s Sky-High Sundae, which was entirely anti-grav, but that&#x27;s okay.

Good Saturday, my darlings, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing. You find The Industry&#x27;s Chris Moyse at the end of a pretty exhausting week, packed out with behind-the-scenes dealings at Destructoid, mired in three games for review, and suffering from a severe lack of sleep. Reasons unknown. In addition, we just had The Geoff Awards 2022, and we&#x27;re prepping Destructoid&#x27;s own GOTY antics.
It&#x27;s been a pretty hectic and tiresome seven days for me, and, in its own way, I&#x27;m sure it has for you. But all that matters is that, right now, it&#x27;s Saturday morning, and we&#x27;ve gotten together for this weekly sewing circle of the great and good of gaming. I hope we can enjoy some great chatter, some shared experiences, and plenty of smiles this week, and I hope that your…</span>

[Update: Today is your final opportunity to sign up for next week&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 open beta.]
Capcom has announced that it will be holding a second closed beta later this month for the highly anticipated release Street Fighter 6 — Once again, the invite-only test run will be open to PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X players, and will take place from December 16 until December 19.
Interested parties should sign up at the official beta application website. Capcom has decreed that, due to the unlicensed selling of codes from October&#x27;s beta, all participants MUST have their platform and Capcom ID linked in order to receive direct access to the test beta. The chosen participants will be picked by random lottery, not on a first-come, first-served basis.

When it comes to modern video games, there are few more polarising terms than &#x27;roguelike&#x27;. That divisive descriptor draws some players like moths to a flame, while others run a mile at the mere whisper of it.

The incredible indulgence of watching a blockbuster movie is that every second of it cost tens of thousands of dollars to produce. Each minute, a couple of million dollars of production glitz is poured into your flickering eyeballs, while you stuff your slack jaw with popcorn. Papetura is both exactly like that and nothing like that at all at the same time.
Produced mainly by lone creative Thomas Ostafin, Papetura burst onto crowdfunding site Indiegogo in 2015, but it didn’t reach its funding target. However, after four more years of refusing to be discouraged, the game made it to Steam in 2019. If there’s a clearer example of a gaming passion project, we don’t know what it is. So, while the megabucks aren’t flying at your face as you play, every background in the game, every animation, every puzzle, and every scene is made of pure, highly concentrated graft. And it feels like an indulgence and a privilege to play.

                              <span>Just how super is it..?
Hi folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
Last time we took a look at one of the Sega Genesis&#x27; finest games, Castlevania: Bloodlines (also known as Castlevania: The New Generation).

In case you missed it, one of the big Nintendo-related announcements at The Game Awards this year was the reveal of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. This new Switch game is arriving early next year on 17th March, and as result, there&#x27;s already a fair bit of information about it.
The latest update comes directly from Nintendo&#x27;s website, revealing the digital version of this new storybook spin-off will require around 3.5GB of free space. Unsurprisingly, this is much smaller than the recent release Bayonetta 3, which took up 16GB.

Pokémon designer and Sword &amp; Shield Art Director James Turner might not be working with Game Freak anymore, but it seems he had some involvement with the new entries Pokémon Scarlet and Violet before he did leave the company.
In a post on social media, Turner revealed he actually designed the professors Sada (Scarlet) and Turo (Violet) in the new games. You know, the ones who caused quite a stir online when they were first revealed. He even shared his own illustration of them:

Sonic Frontiers almost won the &#x27;Player&#x27;s Voice Award&#x27; at The Game Awards earlier this week. In response to this, the game&#x27;s director Morio Kishimoto has once again thanked fans and all the staff that worked on the game for their support. He went on to mention how it&#x27;s inspired the team to create an even &quot;greater&quot; experience next time.

&quot;We made it into the top 5 of TGA Players&#x27; Voice! This is all thanks to your support! The third generation is off to a good start. I&#x27;m happy! I am sure that this result will be a big driving force for the next work. We promise you an experience of greater excitement and surprise. Finally, I would like to thank all the staff involved in this project.&quot;

It&#x27;s no secret narrative games are my all-time favorites. I went into this year&#x27;s Game Awards not expecting much, but little did I know I&#x27;d be punched in the face over and over again with some incredible game trailers. There are a ton of great games to look forward to over the next couple of years (many of which are not on this list), but I had to take the time to highlight some of the games that have me amped.
It&#x27;s actually a pretty good mix of DLC and sequels to some of my favorite titles, and also some new IPs that will be breaking out onto the scene with their debut title. Regardless, I walked away from the show more impressed than I have been in a long time -- it seems the Awards hit at just the right part of the these games&#x27; d…</span>

World of Warcraft&#x27;s Corrupted Blood pandemic from back in 2005 is one of the most notorious, and yet fascinating, things to ever happen in the game. It even has its own Wikipedia page titled &quot;The Corrupted Blood Incident.&quot; For those who may not be familiar, basically what happened was that there was a debuff associated with a certain boss fight at the end of a raid. The debuff could pass between players in close proximity, and while it was intended to be active only in the boss&#x27; region, a bug allowed Corrupted Blood to spread across the entirety of Azeroth, the game&#x27;s fictional world.
It&#x27;s an uncanny phenomenon given what we&#x27;ve experienced over the past few years. The Incident was so good at replicated how disease spreads in the real world, in fact,…</span>

Following on from last week&#x27;s much-celebrated and long-awaited release of Tetris: The Grand Master, retro publisher Hamster returns to its bag big of Namco classics this week, with the arrival of 3D maze chaser Pac-Mania, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released to arcades in 1987, before finding itself ported to myriad home computers and consoles, Pac-Mania was something of a very big deal upon its launch, due to its fresh adaptation of Pac-Man&#x27;s genre-defining gameplay from an all-new 3D perspective. Choosing an oblique 3/4 viewing angle, and sporting some delightfully cartoonish sprites, Pac-Mania offered a new approach to the pill-munching action of its 1980 predecessor.
Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber MegaMan52.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ctJFLJ5w88U
Once again, our boy is charged with dashing around a symmetrical maze, gobbling up power pellets, and staying one step ahead of the ghostly gang of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde, and &quot;Sue&quot;. As a major game-changer, Pac-Man now has the ability to leap over his enemies, offering him a handy escape when cornered. Later stages introduce new ghosts... erm... &quot;Funky and Spunky&quot; both of whom also have the ability to take to the air, intercepting Pac-Man&#x27;s avian action. A popular release in arcades and on the home market, Pac-Mania remains one of the most recognizable of the Pac-Man sequels.
Pac-Mania is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. It should be noted that it is also included as part of Bandai Namco&#x27;s compendium Pac-Man Museum +.

                              <span>The &quot;extensive similarities&quot; have Riot pushing for damages
Riot Games is suing over the similarities it&#x27;s found in a NetEase game to its own Valorant. A new suit filed by Riot claims that NetEase&#x27;s Hyper Front is a copy of the tactical shooter Valorant.
As reported on by Polygon, Riot has field suit over NetEase&#x27;s Hyper Front, which is also a team-based tactical shooter. According to the filing, Riot claims Hyper Front is a copy of &quot;substantial parts&quot; of Valorant.
Valorant launched on PC in 2020, and Riot is currently developing a mobile version. Meanwhile, Hyper Front was released in 2022 for mobile platforms on iOS and Android.
In the suit, Riot lays out the similarities. It&#x27;s not just the number of players, but Riot points directly at maps, character designs, weapons, and even the raw numbers from the weapons. There are actual spreadsheets in the filing, comparing the data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;qRao6FARFRo
Rushing the point
Riot does note that NetEase made modifications to Hyper Front following the first complaints. However, the infringement goes further.
&quot;All of our creative choices are mirrored in NetEase’s game,&quot; said Riot Games layer Dan Nabel to Polygon. &quot;We don’t think that changing the color of a character ability or slightly modifying the visual appearance changes the fact that it’s copyright infringement. It’s like that old saying, ‘You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.&#x27;&quot;
Riot Games is seeking an injunction, which would likely essentially shut down Hyper Front, and &quot;substantial&quot;, but unspecified, figures for damages. It&#x27;s also litigating the claim in several courts around the world.
&quot;We don’t want to rely on one particular market to have this issue resolved,&quot; Nabel told Polygon. &quot;NetEase is a global publisher, as are we. We want them to know that we take the matter very seriously.&quot;

I knew exactly what I was getting into with Samurai Maiden, I’m just not exactly sure why I went with it. I guess I was hoping it might do something different. You could easily describe it as an Isekai, though technically, the main character travels back to the past; she then goes into Yomi. It’s about her trying to survive, kind of, while she’s being helped by ninjas from both her own and parallel dimensions. It’s a little bit yuri, and pretty shoujo.
I guess with it tying in the Sengoku period, I was hoping it might do something unique.
Nope.

                              <span>An ambitious title that just misses the mark.
The world wasn’t ready for Romancing SaGa when it was first released back in 1992. It wasn’t until the PS2 remake in 2005 that the title would make its way to western shores, where it quickly gained a passionate following among fans of its non-linear storytelling, expressive characters, and multiple-choice approach to protagonists. Playing through this remaster of the JRPG cult classic, dubbed Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered, reminds us of how special it is, despite some baffling design decisions.
Unlike the 2005 remake, this is more of an upgrade on the Romancing SaGa experience rather than a complete overhaul. It comes with updated, shiny HD visuals and new playable characters, as well as a handful of quality-of-life changes to improve the experience for new players. But even as a remaster of a 20-year-old JRPG, Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered is an ambitious title that tries to do many things that even modern games struggle with.

As 2022 winds down, Bandai Namco has announced it will be terminating the online service for Dragon Ball Card Warriors in 2023. Card Warriors is a free card game update for Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot and was made available earlier this year on the Nintendo Switch in March.
There&#x27;s no specific date just yet, but when the service does conclude, Bandai Namco will release an offline version of Card Warriors, allowing players to take on CPU opponents offline.

If you visited the site throughout November, you&#x27;ll likely know that we ran a store-wide promotion offering 10% off games and eShop credit for Black Friday. Well, the sale turned out to be so popular that we&#x27;re bringing it back to cover the holiday period, hopefully giving you the chance to save money on more games this Christmas or maybe even treat your loved ones to some credit on the big day.
Just like we did for the Black Friday sale, we&#x27;re knocking 10% off absolutely everything on the store, including eShop credit, Switch Online subscriptions, and games such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Splatoon 3 and more.

It has been yet another fun-filled week here at Nintendo Life and we are ready to once again hit the ol&#x27; games this weekend.
In the past seven days we have had The Game Awards (and the absence of any Tears of the Kingdom news thereof), a brand new wave of courses and bonus features in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and the news that Nintendo might just be getting a dose of Call of Duty action in the coming years. We also had a chance to sit down with the creators of Cuphead who spoke about all things gaming, animating and Netflix-ing.

Apart from all those announcements at the Game Awards yesterday, there were also some new games released on the Nintendo Switch this week. One, in particular, that perhaps deserves just a little more attention is the new Dragon Quest spin-off, Dragon Quest Treasures.
We&#x27;ve already shared our own Nintendo Life review - calling Treasures a &quot;great&quot; introduction to the JRPG genre and awarding it 8 out of 10 stars. You can read it in full below:

It&#x27;s been a busy week on the Nintendo week, with the company launching its third wave of DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and also announcing an expansion pass for the upcoming Fire Emblem game. In case you missed it, Splatoon 3 also got another update.
While we&#x27;ve already issued a PSA about the &quot;first big run event&quot;, it seems the latest patch notes for Version 2.0.1 have revealed some extra details. There are apparently some player controller adjustments and a handful of other fixes. Here&#x27;s the rundown, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s support page:

This is a good deal for a mouse loved for its high-tech scroll wheel, wide and comfortable shape and long-ass battery life.

                              <span>Some men just want to watch the world burn, and that includes me. The Devil&#x27;s Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a &quot;wildcard condition&quot; called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

                              <span>Your wallet may still be quivering from the Steam Autumn Sale. Tough. It&#x27;s time to grab hold of it again, comfort it with a few tender strokes, then gorge on its innards to pay for some of the splendid turn-based strategy games on sale in Steam&#x27;s TurnBasedFest.
There are decent discounts for Katharine&#x27;s beloved Dorfromantik, my beloved Slipways, and many generally beloved digified board games. Most of the sales end on December 12th, so don&#x27;t spend too long thinking about it. Reality&#x27;s turn-timers aren&#x27;t optional.

                              <span>The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that&#x27;s just my bad decisions talking. You&#x27;re stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It&#x27;s not super secret, but I almost don&#x27;t want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because we&#x27;ve done our own awards, and who needs a live show with a smiley man in clean, clean trainers when you&#x27;ve got a list of the games and things in games that we liked for reasons too specific to get a category on stage? Also, none of them are Elden Ring.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they&#x27;re bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren&#x27;t check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn&#x27;t a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don&#x27;t think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I&#x27;ll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

                              <span>A lot of people claim foisting modern graphics on older games just results in compromising the original&#x27;s artistic vision. I am a chump who likes shiny things, so the release of Portal with RTX on Steam pleases me. It&#x27;s free if you own Portal, but fellow chumps should be aware that it&#x27;s not running too hot for everyone, with reports of crashes and literally too-hot GPUs. Ray-tracing does not come cheap.

How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children&#x27;s hospital.

                              <span>If I were a security guard at Black Mesa, my head would get crabbed within minutes of a resonance cascade. Not so for Barney Calhoun, who fought his way free of the facility back in Valve&#x27;s 2001 Half-Life expansion, Blue Shift. Modding team HECU Collective have been forcing him to run that gauntlet again, so far releasing 3 chapters to their mod for Black Mesa - not the fictional company, but the very real (and good) fan remake of the original Half-Life.
Chapter 4: Captive Freight comes out tomorrow, so it&#x27;s a fine time to jump in.

                              <span>Yesterday Wholesome Games hosted another showcase of fresh indies in collaboration with The Game Awards. Though the TGAs proper were full of big games, names, and announcements, the indie showcase was no slouch, highlighting over a dozen exciting indies. One of the most notable was Spirittea, a life-sim where you manage a bathhouse, build relationships with the local NPCs and help various spirits that only you can see. Sort of a Spirited Away meets Stardew Valley proposition.

                              <span>Earlier this year I compared the MMO Lost Ark to grey carpet, in the sense that the MMO Lost Ark is exactly like a grey carpet: trendy yet drab. At the time I&#x27;d been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year&#x27;s Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, I thought, &quot;Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware&#x27;s use of grey&quot;. Even though there isn&#x27;t a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey&#x27;s redemption arc?

                              <span>Speaking as a grown-ass man, I love trains. Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

                              <span>In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

                              <span>Last night at The Game Awards, we learned that not only will there be a Hades 2, but it will be making the absolutely correct choice of letting Zagreus step aside to make way for a new protagonist. This time around we&#x27;ll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She&#x27;s also Zag&#x27;s half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

                              <span>Soulslike RPG The Lords Of The Fallen debuted its first gameplay trailer last night at The Game Awards, showcasing its violent combat, grotesque creature designs, and beautifully grim setting. The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

                              <span>Oh look, it’s the end of the year. I’m very much not looking forward to those first few months where I must train myself to write out the year with a 3 at the end, but thanks to tonight’s much-awaited The Game Awards 2022, I’m left feeling about 33% more hyped for all the games we’re gonna get to play next year.
On the off-chance that you missed the live show, fear not. We’ve sacrificed our sleep to round up every little thing that was trailered or announced at this year’s Game Awards. Take a look at everything that’s on the games horizon, and let us know what you’re looking forward to the most in the comments below!

Not only did we see a montage of increasingly gritty brawls, but also some new info about the fighters we&#x27;ll be seeing in this, octequel(?). Cast your eyes over the trailer below.

                              <span>The Geoffries tonight saw the announcement of a new cooperative heist FPS with set in the 90s, with an extremely 90s cast. 90s actors featuring in Crime Boss: Rockay City include Michael Madsen, Kim Basinger, Danny Glover, Danny Trejo, and even Vanilla Ice and Chuck Norris. The game looks a whole lot like Payday but honestly, I&#x27;m always up for more heists. Check out the trailer below.

It&#x27;s called Immortals of Aveum, and it&#x27;s being made by the recently-formed Ascendant Studios - which you might remember is Dead Space creative director Bret Robbins&#x27; new thing. Details about the first-person magic shoot &#x27;em up are slim, but the trailer shows off some flashy magical spells and a fantasy city in crisis. You can watch the teaser reveal below.

Good job you’re around to give it a jolly good thwacking in action-survival game Remnant 2, a sequel to Remnant: From The Ashes announced during The Game Awards tonight. Your do-gooder can play solo or team up to sort out some pretty unpleasant monstrosities with up to two pals. Have a glance at the trailer below to see some very creepy beasties, and hear someone absolutely wail on their axe.

                              <span>For the longest time, FromSoftware were best known for their Armored Core series of middling mech games. Then they found a whole new audience with Demon&#x27;s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, and nary a big robot in sight. Well, now FromSoft are returning to big stompy boys with Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon, coming in 2023. Check out the cool mechs in the announcement trailer from tonight&#x27;s Geoffries, below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that&#x27;s the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight&#x27;s Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix&#x27;s next JRPG epic won&#x27;t be landing on &quot;other platforms&quot; until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that FF16&#x27;s PC release won&#x27;t be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we&#x27;ve seen in its new &quot;Revenge&quot; trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

                              <span>During The Game Awards, Behaviour Interactive announced that their new PvP raid game Meet Your Maker will debut next year on April 4th 2023. This is a wholly new IP from the studio, who you might know as the creators behind survival horror slasher, Dead By Daylight. Check out what Behaviour Interactive mean exactly by a &quot;building-and-raiding game&quot; by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Right, here’s where I have to stay objective and professional. I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle. Just watch the trailer below and tell me what you think, go on.

                              <span>Man, I was never much of a Flash liker, but even I feel a bit sorry for him in tonight&#x27;s new trailer for Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. He gets a right old beating in the new Game Awards footage, but thankfully it looks like The Batman will be on hand to deliver some much needed... justice (sorry) when it comes out on May 26th 2023. Maybe. Miss you, Kevin Conroy.

This &quot;gameplay reveal trailer&quot; only has a few wee snippets of the game being played, but they&#x27;re solid. As our boy Spice Maureen stomps through vast Gothic industrial ruins and cuts through hordes of aliens, it&#x27;s got that &#x27;Dynasty Warriors meets God Of War&#x27; look again. But I do already miss the Orks.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Nod are still primarily associated with Life Is Strange and a handful of other narrative-focused adventure games. Back in 2018, however, they also made action RPG Vampyr, which mixed more substantial combat among their usual focus on story. 

It&#x27;s in this vein that Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden seems to continue. It&#x27;s an action RPG about &quot;two proficient ghost hunters and lovers&quot; set in the haunted, frozen wilderness of 1695 North America. You can watch the reveal trailer below.

                              <span>The big Company Of Heroes 3 news from tonight&#x27;s Game Awards was that, in addition to launching on PC on February 23rd next year, the WW2 RTS will also be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X and S consoles in 2023 at a later date. The exact timing of the Company Of Heroes 3 Console Edition is yet to be confirmed, but it will mark the first time Relic&#x27;s historical real-time strategy game will be available to play outside of PC. However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game&#x27;s multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have &quot;no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch&quot;.

                              <span>After six months of shambling around PlayStation 5 consoles, Naughty Dog&#x27;s first installment of The Last Of Us is heading to PC next year. Confirmed at tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, The Last Of Us Part 1 will be clicking onto PC on March 3rd 2023. Honestly, I just want to see the giraffes again, really. Those zombies can get stuffed.

                              <span>Anime is a Good Thing. There, I said it. Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain&#x27;t bad either (that&#x27;s one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It&#x27;s being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

And it shows! The game certainly looks like an ARPG, akin to say, Torchlight, with heroes battling against shadowy monsters to earn lots of rare and epic and legendary loot. It looks fine, good and dandy, so why not give the reveal trailer below a nice little watch?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a full year since ex-BioWare boss Aaryn Flynn and his new studio Inflexion announced Nightingale at The Game Awards. In case you&#x27;ve forgotten, Nightingale is a PvE crafting survival game with a strong Victoriana vibe, but since our chat with them back at Summer Games Fest in June, and an early access delay into the first half of 2023 to accommodate the switch to Unreal Engine 5, we haven&#x27;t heard too much about the game.


I got to natter with Flynn, director of production Leah Summers, and art director Neil Thompson earlier this week, ahead of the debut of a new trailer for Nightingale at The Game Awards this evening. They filled me in on how the game&#x27;s blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.

Devs Larian Studios have shared a new trailer at The Game Awards, revealing that the RPG threequel will head out of early access in August 2023. Not only that, but some well-known heroes from the first two games are returning too. Watch the trailer below to see how old hands Jaheira and Minsc are faring these days, and get a peek at the city of Baldur’s Gate.

You’re the unfortunately named Judas, a mysterious figure trapped on a starship that’s falling to bits. Our Judas is also surrounded by some not very nice folks.

                              <span>If you’ve ever opened an umbrella and wished you could take off into the air like a fussy Edwardian governess prone to breaking into song, then you’ll probably get a kick out of the latest trailer for Nightingale. We got another glimpse at Inflexion&#x27;s survival craft ‘em up during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, which showed off some of the magical enchantments you’ll get to encounter. Case in point: flying brollies. Have a watch below and tell me this don’t look like a right lark, guv’nor. What? I’m British, I can talk like Dick Van Dyke if I want.

And they&#x27;re joined by honorary BB Girl Fragile, who seems to have both an actual child of her own to shepherd about, and... a BB Octopus?

                              <span>A new trailer for Destiny 2: Lightfall hot and fresh out of The Geoffries tonight certainly makes the next expansion for Bungie&#x27;s MMOFPS look cool. Neomuna, the neon capital megacity of Neptune, is very pretty. The new &#x27;Strand&#x27; powers of grappling hooks and rope darts look dead cool. Bungie always have good trailers. It doesn&#x27;t show any of the mindnumbing grind you&#x27;ll be forced through to play the best bits but hey, that&#x27;s trailers.

Announced during tonight&#x27;s Game Awards, this sequel to 2020&#x27;s bestest best game breaks from the story of Zagreus to instead follow Hades&#x27; ruthless daughter Melinoe. It&#x27;s Supergiant so of course we get a gorgeous animated trailer for it, too, which you can watch below.

A roguelite action adventure developed by Upstream Arcade and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, Web Of Wyrd was revealed at tonight’s Game Awards. It&#x27;s the first game to star Hellboy since 2008&#x27;s Hellboy: The Science Of Evil. You can see Big Red in action by giving the trailer below the ol’ watcheroonie.

                              <span>There&#x27;s no real news to report about Atomic Heart. It&#x27;s still a Soviet-inspired first-person shooter about battling unsettling robots in an alt-history 1950s. It&#x27;s still coming out on February 21st, 2023. There is a new trailer however, shown tonight during The Game Awards, and it continues to convince me that Atomic Heart won&#x27;t be short on spectacular setpieces.

In the debate between 1989’s Final Fight and 1991’s Streets of Rage, I’m in the latter camp. Don’t get me wrong, I love Final Fight and understand that Streets of Rage was just Sega’s answer to Capcom porting their seminal brawler to the SNES. I also realize that Streets of Rage is a blatant rip-off of Final Fight. However, I just love the sense of style and the fact that it’s better suited to consoles.
However, Streets of Rage doesn’t have Mike Haggar, former pro-wrestler and beloved mayor of Metro City. Haggar is amazing not just because he’s built like a pizza oven, but also because his backstory is so sparse you can apply whatever features you want onto him. Is he a mayor who only knows how to address crime with his fists? Maybe. Or perhaps he was working on addressing crim…</span>

Dragon Quest Treasures has finally arrived for Nintendo Switch, and with a 77 score on Metacritic as of this writing, most reviewers seem to think it&#x27;s a pretty good time. In my review, I found it to be a delightful way to pass the hours with a charming world and addictive gameplay. And as much as I do like the game, I&#x27;m aware that it doesn&#x27;t exactly do the best job of informing the player of everything they can do in it. Some things you&#x27;ll only learn via hint screens or in passing dialogue, so to better help those treasure hunters who are starting their journeys today, I thought I&#x27;d collect seven Dragon Quest Treasures tips to get you going the right way.

Supergiant Games is working on Hades II, its first-ever sequel, as it confirmed at last night&#x27;s Game Awards. The reveal trailer has tons of tidbits, details, and plenty of new gods and goddesses to see.
The first Hades received a lot of acclaim, due in part to how it interpreted Greek myth into Superigant&#x27;s version of the Underworld. For Hades II, that doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed.

In a new FAQ about Hades II, Supergiant shares some details about what it&#x27;s calling a direct sequel to the first Hades. And while mythology is certainly back in focus, Supergiant&#x27;s turned towards one specific area: witchcraft.

It&#x27;s knuckle-up time, as developer Sloclap has released a new update for its time-hopping brawler Sifu — The fall update, now available on all platforms, adds several new features, skins, and game modifiers for the super-challenging beat-&#x27;em-up adventure.
The core of the new update lies in an exciting new Replay Editor, which will let players take a directorial eye to their highlight reels of window-smashing, chair-tossing carnage. The editor features a free-moving camera, cut &#x27;n&#x27; copy tools, speed modifiers, and visual effects, all of which might not quite have you recreating the best fist-throwing flick since Yes, Madam, but will allow you to showcase your finest fights at the heart-stopping best. Annnnnnd ACTION!

In addition to the replay editor, the Sifu Fall update also includes a selection of brand-new game modifiers. These include the youth-sapping &quot;Vampire&quot; mode, a &quot;Free Throw&quot; option for all you grappler fans, and the mighty &quot;Touch of Death&quot; modifier for Bruce Lee-style one-punch knockouts. Three new outfits have also been added to the protagonist&#x27;s wardrobe, including two versions of the &quot;Wing Chung&quot; ensemble, and a bonus &quot;Stunt Double&quot; outfit for Deluxe Edition owners — which contains the perfect jacket for those late-night drives.
Sifu is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>This is My Dune... So clear off.
You wait decades for a brand-new Dune video game, and then two come along at once! Yes in addition to the 2022 strategy title Dune: Spice Wars, Funcom has released pre-alpha footage of an upcoming MMO set within the arrid planes of Arrakis: Dune: Awakening.
As demonstrated at yesterday&#x27;s Game Awards, Dune: Awakening will see players the world over attempt to thrive, or merely survive, in the cut-throat dystopian world of Frank Herbert&#x27;s iconic sci-fi series. Starting out as a desperate survivor wandering the hazardous horizons, players will guide their custom characters in a quest for shelter, water, defense, companionship, and the ultimate desire of the Arrakian world: Spice.

From there, savvy survivalists will be able to build and trade among their local community, gain favor of the Great Houses, build and equip an arsenal of weaponry, work with spice harvesting corporations, and build themselves up among the corporations and nobility that holds fort over the lucrative lands. Of course, you might just get eaten by a sandworm on your first day — which honestly sounds like less work and perhaps the better option.
Funcom notes that it will roll out further trailers and gameplay overviews over the coming months, giving players a general overview of Dune: Awakening&#x27;s gameplay, options, and features ahead of its official beta launch. A date for the beta was not announced, but we do know that Dune: Awakening is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. So you&#x27;d better get your house in order.

                              <span>Selene&#x27;s odyssey starts again, and again, and...
Alongside the news that The Last of Us Part I is coming to PC in March 2023, Sony also took time at The Game Awards to offer a release window for a PC port of Housemarque&#x27;s dazzling space adventure, Returnal — As revealed in a short trailer, the time-skipping title will hit Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.
Launching in April 2021 as a showcase piece for the burgeoning PS5 platform, Returnal is the story of an intrepid space explorer, Selene, who crash lands on a mysterious planet, playing host to the remnants of some lost, undiscovered civilization. Meeting an untimely end soon after jettisoning her spacecraft, Selene finds herself resurrected back in its cockpit, doomed to relive life, after life, after life until she can uncover the mystery behind this strange world and, hopefully, find her way back home.

Developed by shmup enthusiasts Housemarque, Returnal combines the team&#x27;s love of bullet hell gameplay with its proven talent for creating eye-popping visuals, dramatic lightning effects, and wide palette of splendid colors, in order to create a compelling third-person adventure. Celebrated for its challenging action, lush environments, and intriguing story of self-reflection, Returnal was an early hit for Sony&#x27;s fancy new hardware and was almost custom-made for the splendor and power of the PC platform.
Returnal launches on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2023.

If you&#x27;re gagging for some more Aloy action, then Guerrilla Games has you covered, as the studio has revealed a new expansion, currently in the works for the PS5 edition of Horizon Forbidden West — The new &quot;Burning Shores&quot; DLC was revealed during The Game Awards yesterday evening.
A brief trailer, which you can check out below, sees our spritely hero as she soars through the skies astride her trusty Sunwing. From there, she approaches a lush but swamped island, located south of the Tenakth Clan Lands. Upon approach, we the audience realize that our girl has wandered into a dystopian aftermath that was once Los Angeles, but has now become little more than a volcanic archipelago, littered with further threats charged by the force of &quot;The Machines&quot;.

According to the development team, Burning Shores will feature extended travel by land, sea, and air — offering players a brand-new location that can be fully explored via all three methods. Aloy will also find herself up against a terrifying new mechanical behemoth, which appears to be some form of crustacean hybrid if the splash art is anything to go by. According to Guerrilla, the scale of the DLC — in both size and visual fidelity — has led the team to focus on the PS5 platform only, suggesting that the new expansion will not be developed for PS4.
Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms — The Burning Shores DLC will launch on PS5 only on April 19, 2023.

When Choo-Choo Charles was first revealed to the world, I got that too-good-to-be-true feeling. Sure, it looked like a lot of fun, but how do you build an entire game around fighting an evil train? I was then reminded that I thought the same thing about Happy’s Humble Burger Farm, which coincidentally was released about one year ago. Will Choo-Choo Charles become my next horror obsession?
No.
But that’s not as damning as it seems. In fact, if there’s one thing I really respect about Choo-Choo Charles, it’s that it knows exactly what it is and is focused on delivering that. And it does.

Spring, perhaps best known for its bright lights, sweet flowers, and promise of a sparkling new year, will find itself a little clouded over in the coming year, following the news that brutal misery fest The Last of Us Part I will be making its way to PC, (via Steam) on March 3, 2023.
As announced during yesterday evening&#x27;s Game Awards, Naughty Dog&#x27;s critically acclaimed (if somewhat expensive) remake will be making the leap from PS5 to desktops everywhere, offering PC players the chance to check out its modernized gameplay mechanics, overhauled controls, and stunning visual clarity — not to mention its hugely impressive range of new accessibility options.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LW5NwaUXgIA&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;PlayStation
The Last of Us Part I is the definitive edition of the award-winning 2013 release — a grim tale of two survivors thrust together within a rapidly decaying world. Celebrated for its gut-punch storytelling, frightening array of mutants, and claustrophobic atmosphere, The Last of Us would be remastered for PS4 just one year later, before receiving the full remake treatment in September of this year.
The Last of Us Part I launches on PC March 3, 2023 with pre-orders now live on Steam. Additionally, Netflix&#x27;s live-action adaptation, The Last of Us, will hit the streaming service on January 15, 2023.

If, like my good self, you found yourself enraptured by the fantastic 2018 platformer Celeste, then you&#x27;ll be Extremely OK with this brand new trailer for Earthblade, which premiered as a part of yesterday evening&#x27;s Game Award festivities.
Dripping with simplistic style, as only Team Celeste know how, Earthblade will follow the adventures of Nevoa, Child of Fate, as they return to what remains of a ruined Earth in what looks to be another pixelated tale packed with challenges on a physical and emotional scale. According to EXOK, Earthblade will feature seamless exploration, engaging combat, and &quot;countless mysteries&quot;, as Nevoa explores the world, meets friend and foe, and overcomes numerous obstacles in their search for answers.

From this conceptual trailer, it seems that Earthblade will feature a more typical open-world adventure experience akin to something like Team Cherry&#x27;s Hollow Knight. But the recognizable charm and style of EXOK Games are readily apparent here. From the ethereal music and forlorn atmosphere to its intriguing character design — detailed in such simplicity — and the heavy leanings toward multi-directional world traversal and the satisfaction of the journey itself. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on this one, and fans of the strange and fantastical would do well to do the same.
Earthblade is currently in development for PC. It is scheduled to launch sometime in 2024.

At The Game Awards 2022, Activision announced a brand new title set in the zany, madcap world of Crash Bandicoot — but unlike the typical 3D platformers for which the series is renowned, Crash Team Rumble will instead see the series&#x27; colorful cast square off in a bout of multiplayer madness.
Crash Team Rumble, currently in development for PlayStation and Xbox, will see Crash, Coco, Tawna, Dr. Cortex, and many other heroes and villains from the beloved series battle it out in 4-v-4 team-based action. Players will race to gather Wumpa Fruit for their squad, racing back to bank it in their home base while defending their stock from the opposing team and getting into frenzied melee scraps out on the battlefield. Each character will be afforded their own special skills and bespoke abilities, so teamwork and character synergy will be the key to claiming victory.

&quot;We’re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; said Toys for Bob&#x27;s Paul Yan in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone— easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero’s unique abilities.&quot;
While not quite the long-rumored Super Smash Bros. clone that people have been expecting, this all-new take on the wild &#x27;n&#x27; wacky world of Crash could prove to be a pretty neat party title, and feels more in the vein of a Splatoon than a Smash Bros. I don&#x27;t see my boy Ripper Roo just yet, but I do see my mirror image, (Dingodile), so I guess I&#x27;ve found my main already.
Crash Team Rumble will launch in 2023 on PlayStation and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Fist Meets Fate
Tekken fans got a fresh new look at Bandai Namco&#x27;s exciting new fighter Tekken 8 during last night&#x27;s Game Awards festivities. A new trailer offered up new hints on the sequel&#x27;s highly dramatic narrative, while also sneaking in glimpses of several combatants returning to The King of Iron Fist Tournament.
The preview sees Kazuya Mishima, now fully possessed by the Devil gene, running amok throughout the planet, raining destruction down on its populace. Standing against him will be the newly-reformed Jin Kazama, charged with the blood in his veins and the spirit of his deceased mother in his heart. The preview is a pretty melodramatic affair, as one would expect from the Tekken franchise — but I&#x27;ll be darned if it didn&#x27;t make the Tekken 8 storyline look like a pretty cataclysmic affair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_tXTWVncFP4&amp;t&#x3D;77s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica
In addition to the plot details, the trailer also featured some returning Tekken acolytes, including the fiery pro-wrestler, King, the man-mountain android Jack, Bruce-Lee-alike Marshall Law, his running buddy Paul Phoenix and the far-too-handsome-to-be-a-special agent Lars. We also catch a sneak peek at Jun Kazama herself, suggesting that she too will be making her return to the ring. All of this was rendered in dazzling current-gen technology, offering visual splendor yet to be seen in the long-running series. It&#x27;s looking good. Damn good.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5. PC, and Xbox Series X.

[Update: As noted in this evening&#x27;s Game Awards, a Forspoken demo is now available for download on PS5. A new trailer was also premiered, which you can check out below.]

[Original Article]
As is often the case in the lead-up to The Game Awards, several rumors and leaks are floating around the information superhighway ahead of Keighley&#x27;s grand festivities — Case in point: a tweet published by the Japanese PlayStation Twitter, pointing to an incoming demo for Square Enix adventure Forspoken.
The (now deleted) tweet sported some attractive new splash art, emblazoned with the words &quot;Demo Announcement Trailer&quot;. The sudden removal of the tweet suggests that said video is cued to play during tonight&#x27;s live TGA presentation. The deleted tweet also referenced an 11-minute Forspoken gameplay showcase, which will likely be hosted on the official PlayStation YouTube channel tomorrow, December 9, as part of Forspoken&#x27;s continuing &quot;Deep Dive&quot; video series.

While Forspoken has had something of an inauspicious start, with online jokesters mocking its marketing strategy and critics raising an eyebrow at some admittedly foolish PR speak, I personally think that Forspoken is an attractive title with potential. A 2023 GOTY contender? maybe not, but it could certainly prove a fun way to kick off 2023&#x27;s gaming year. No doubt Square Enix hopes that allowing players to get their hands on a playable build, giving them the opportunity to explore Athia and meet hero Frey Holland — will help turn around some of this early cynicism ahead of the title&#x27;s impending release.
Forspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.

The final reveal at The Game Awards is one I know many of our readers have been champing at the bit for. Yoshi-P took the stage before the Game of the Year award was handed out to drop a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI. Like with each of the game&#x27;s previous trailers, this thing looks incredible and is bound to grab a few nominees at next year&#x27;s award show.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;4GOtYqLkj2g
Of course, the most important thing about that trailer is the announcement of the release date. The Final Fantasy XVI release date is June 22, 2023. And remember, it&#x27;s coming exclusively to PlayStation 5.
Since the game was originally announced, we&#x27;ve learned quite a bit about the upcoming action RPG. For starters, the game will not be open-world and will instead use a collection of large, explorable areas. Yoshi-P has also taken to the press to talk about the overall direction of the series moving away from its turn-based origins to become arguably the premier action RPG series in the world.
Final Fantasy XVI will be the first mainline entry in the storied series in nearly seven years. That&#x27;s a long time to wait, but with Yoshi-P at the helm, I believe it will have been worth it.

                              <span>Medieval is out, mechs are back in
The studio behind the Souls series is returning to another part of its roots. FromSoftware has confirmed it&#x27;s working on Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon.
Revealed tonight at The Game Awards 2022, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon sees the studio return to the mech series with some serious production value. Check out the trailer below to get an idea for yourself:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kKO1s-CUZvY
The new Armored Core entry is currently set for a 2023 launch. The trailer splash shows both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.
A return to a classic series
It&#x27;s been a while since FromSoftware went back to the Armored Core series. The mech action lineage started in 997 on the PlayStation, and carried on through Armored Core: Verdict Day in 2013.
The early entries of Armored Core are certainly well-remembered. But as sentiment waned on newer releases, the series took a backseat. With the Souls games taking off, FromSoftware followed their trajectory, leading up to games like this year&#x27;s Game Awards heavyweight Elden Ring.

FromSoftware has certainly earned enough goodwill from fans to revisit the series. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how those who jumped on with the Souls series take to the giant mechs and action of Armored Core. As someone who played a good few of them on his PlayStation 2 back in the era, I&#x27;m certainly keen to see what FromSoft does with this series years later.
Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is currently slated for 2023.

                              <span>Hopefully, it&#x27;s more than meets the eye
I&#x27;ve made it a rule to try and avoid writing about game announcements that are nothing but CGI trailers and I&#x27;m going to break that rule right now. One of the more curious announcements from The Game Awards was for a new Transformers game called Transformers: Reactivate. 
From developer Splash Damage, Reactivate will be a 1-4 player online action game planned for PC and consoles. In the game, a team of human survivors will Autobots to fight back against an extinction-level threat. The short blurb on the game&#x27;s website mentions &quot;salvage&quot; which leads me to believe you&#x27;ll be customizing your Autobot or Autobots.

Sadly, it&#x27;s still just a CGI trailer. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get a better look at what Splash Damage has in store before Transformers: Reactivate enters Early Access next year.

                              <span>A reimagined classic sets out next month
Ken and Roberta Williams&#x27; 3D interpretation of the classic Colossal Cave is set to launch next month. Colossal Cave will go live on January 19, 2023.
Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2022, the new version of this adventure is coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC and Mac, and the Meta Quest 2. Previous generation consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, are expected to get Colossal Cave sometime in Q1 2023.
This 3D version of Colossal Cave is based on the original Colossal Cave Adventure, a classic text adventure game. Sierra On-Line co-founders Ken and Roberta Williams have taken that classic and made it 3D, moving from words and descriptions into full-on environments. There&#x27;s still a narrator though, to capture some of that original feel.
The goal is to traverse the cave, collect items, and return home safe and sound. Simple, it may seem, until you realize how much danger awaits in the cave.

Find the treasure and escape the cave
Getting a new version of a classic is something that happens quite often in games. But for both this particular game, and the developers behind it, Colossal Cave feels like a cool way to  honor the long legacy games have built up over the years.
I&#x27;m fascinated to dig into the cave for myself. This was a segment of PC gaming I never got around to, and it&#x27;s been re-imagined by developers who have a lot of respect for the era. And Colossal Cave being playable in virtual reality on the Meta Quest 2 is pretty neat, too. This is a neat convergence point of gaming history to kick off 2023.

What exactly makes a game cozy? Is it the player&#x27;s state of mind while playing? Is it an adherence to specific aesthetics or messages? Is it the inclusion of birds? Well, you might be forgiven for thinking it&#x27;s the last one, because at least ten of the games on this list are about birds specifically, but the idea of a &quot;cozy&quot; game is a bit more nebulous than that.
It&#x27;s more of a feeling, really: a game that you can relax to, that can be challenging but never punishing, with elements of friendship, community, and kindness. But not always — some &quot;cozy&quot; games (like a certain game about a bad goose) are more about letting the player go a little bit wild, but always in a way that&#x27;s gentler and less severe than chopping people&#x27;s heads off in a Dark Souls or a Witcher game.

I have a Switch. And I have a Steam Deck. I am a fancy lady with two consoles designed for the kind of people who really like to be horizontal when playing games, which suits me just fine, because I am often to be found being horizontal and/or playing games. But I see a lot of folks pitting my two expensive rectangles against one another, and although I can see why, I don&#x27;t agree that comparisons are the most helpful way to look at the two of them.
The Steam Deck and the Switch are not exactly apples and oranges, or chalk and chocolate, or whatever your favourite incomparables are. After all, they&#x27;re both the same shape. They both play games. And Valve&#x27;s portable-ish console is clearly modelled after the Switch, anyway.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>This evening’s presentation of The Game Awards brought us a new cinematic look at Diablo IV. The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

Blue Protocol was not announced during the 2022 Game Awards, but up until now, it hasn&#x27;t been clear if the game would be making its way outside of Japan. During the show, a new trailer for the game was shared, alongside a confirmation that the game would be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in new regions the second half of 2023. Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

                              <span>Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It&#x27;s called Judas, and if you&#x27;re a BioShock fan, you&#x27;ll be happy with what you&#x27;re about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock&#x27;s footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine&#x27;s work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
&quot;You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?&quot;


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They&#x27;ve been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we&#x27;d see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team&#x27;s first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it&#x27;s nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn&#x27;t have a release window, but it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio&#x27;s vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019&#x27;s Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/9/2022:
A &quot;brief playable teaser&quot; for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, &quot;Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser.&quot;
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series&#x27; traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character&#x27;s combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola&#x27;s only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.</span>

Returnal is a roguelike third-person shooter developed by Housemarque, and was one of the first exclusives released on PS5 when it came out in April 2021. You play as Selene Vassos, an astronaut that finds herself stuck in a time loop on an alien planet. It made an appearance at last year&#x27;s game awards as well, where it was nominated for three awards and won Best Action Game. If you want to learn more about the game, you can read our review, where we called it &quot;a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play.&quot;

                              <span>Developer Upstream Arcade and publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment have revealed Mike Mignola&#x27;s Hellboy Web of Wyrd, an upcoming roguelite action game with an art style reminiscent of classic Hellboy comics. 
This news was revealed during the pre-show segment of The Game Awards 2022 by way of a fancy trailer showcasing some of the game&#x27;s methodical but (literally) punchy combat. The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. 


&quot;Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, it&#x27;s clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola&#x27;s original Hellboy comics. It&#x27;s easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.

Unfortunately, we&#x27;ll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist).

                              <span>Dead Cells is getting an official Castlevania DLC crossover sometime early next year, called Dead Cells: Return To Castlevania, as announced today during The Game Awards pre-show. The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. 
The trailer didn&#x27;t reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game&#x27;s Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.


 Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula&#x27;s castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell&#x27;s gameplay, three &quot;epic&quot; boss fights, and 20 outfits from &quot;Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.&quot;
No specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during &quot;Q1&quot; 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</span>

The mode will be added to the game on December 9, though little else was shared about the game.

                              <span>As a surprise ahead of The Game Awards, Vampire Survivors has been released for free on iOS and Android. Both versions are available now. You can find the iOS version here and the Android version here.


Vampire Survivors is an indie roguelike RPG where the player has to avoid hordes of monsters, undead, and (you guessed it) vampires. As you destroy enemies, you progress through a randomized skill tree to unlock new weapons and abilities. To get a better idea of the game, you can read our review, where we called it a “Single-Stick Masterpiece.”
In other Vampire Survivor news, earlier this week developer Poncle announced DLC called Legacy of the Moonspell. It comes with eight new survivors, thirteen new weapons, six new music tracks, new monsters, and a new stage, which they’ve called their biggest yet. It comes out soon, on December 15.</span>

                              <span>Rockstar have teased a new story update coming to GTA Online next week, which pits players against a ramshackle bunch of rival drug dealers. The Los Santos Drug Wars kick off on December 13th with the first part of the update. The short post on Rockstar’s Newswire blog isn&#x27;t exactly awash with details at the moment, but it does give an idea about the kind of dodgy characters and shenanigans you’ll get to encounter, including an angry looking luchador and the return of GTA 5’s Nervous Ron.

                              <span>There’s still so much we don’t know about the next stealth strategy game from the makers of Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun. Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. 
However, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new &quot;Stealth Strategy&quot; label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.

                              <span>The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. 
In a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.

Developers Scavengers Studio have announced a release date of January 31st, 2023. In Season you play as a young woman from a small village exploring the world by bike, and you meet people and record your journey, and discover traces of peoples past. It looks very nice. And I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s where Scavengers Studio would prefer we ended the discussion.

                              <span>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is easily one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year. Alas, I couldn&#x27;t vote for its rightful spot in the RPS Advent calendar because it&#x27;s only on Nintendo Switch, and would out me as somehow who quite enjoys the way anime south Londoners replace rude words with &quot;sparking&quot; or &quot;snuffing&quot;. Still, I will write about the game here! Sorry supporters.
Anyway, what I want to talk about is Xenoblade 3 – so far, at least – never losing sight of its inner tutorial. I&#x27;ve been hit with new, sometimes dizzying tutorials, tens of hours into the game&#x27;s story. Rather than being bummed out by this, I&#x27;m ecstatic. In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s what makes the experience so special.

The game was almost unplayable on PC because shader compilation was causing stuttering whenever anything new happened for the first time, which is not ideal in any game, but especially not an atmospheric horror game with jump scares. It&#x27;s hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.
Anyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday. I&#x27;m out of town right now, so I haven&#x27;t been able to install the second, but I did play test the first one, and whaddaya know? The Callisto Protocol ran smooth for me, using a PC with the recommended specs.

                              <span>A gameplay stream for Square Enix’s fantasy action RPG Forspoken has been dated for December 9th, but PlayStation Japan have tweeted an image that suggested a demo announcement will feature as part of that.

You’ll be able to tune in to the Game Awards-adjacent Forspoken stream at 6pm GMT/7pm CET/10am PT, and presumably find out more about the demo during it.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission is looking to block Microsoft’s pending $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. 
According to a press release, the Commission, whose purpose is to protect consumers by promoting fair market competition, voted 3-1 to file a lawsuit to prevent the deal&#x27;s closure. Thus, a federal judge will weigh in and make a decision. Among other reasons, the FTC cites Microsoft’s record of using previous acquisitions to “suppress competition from rival consoles&quot; and points to the publisher&#x27;s purchase of ZeniMax in 2020 as an example, stating: 
“Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda&#x27;s titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival c…</span>

The colorful adventure game was first revealed at the same event in 2020. It stars a young woman who leaves her isolated village to explore the world for the first time on her bike. Unfortunately, the world is on the brink of suffering a mysterious catastrophe, and the woman collects memories of her experiences before everything falls apart. The bulk of the gameplay, naturally, consists of cycling to different locations and meeting the colorful personalities who inhabit them. You’ll document your adventures by taking photographs and making recordings. 


Season: A Letter to the Future will be available on PlayStation consoles and PC (both Steam and Epic). It&#x27;s worth noting that pricing differs by platform. The game costs $29.99 on console and $24.99 on PC with an additional 10% launch discount until February 7.</span>

We loved slaying Hell&#x27;s fiercest demons with the backdrop of crunchy guitar riffs, double-kick-pedal drum beats, and soaring vocals from some of metal&#x27;s most prolific artists. Today, developer The Outsiders and publisher Funcom have announced a wave of news, including a sales milestone, a new free title update, and the launch of the game on last-generation consoles.
Starting today, Metal: Hellsinger is available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game was originally announced for these platforms at its initial reveal in 2020, but the last-gen versions were eventually canceled. Now, owners of last-gen consoles have access to this demon-slashing and beast-blasting adventure.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one on that list that runs on cheap, widely available AM4 motherboards with better value DDR4 RAM. That&#x27;s probably why the 5800X3D is reportedly AMD&#x27;s most popular CPU by sales - and it&#x27;s also why this deal is coming to the fore. Right now, you can pick up this fast AF CPU for $300 thanks to an Ebay code (JOLLY15), a hefty reduction from its launch price of $450.

Also chickens! You can raise chickens now! They&#x27;ll give you eggs, which give you more chickens. There&#x27;s the real magic.

                              <span>The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I&#x27;d make in almost every situation, as you&#x27;ll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you&#x27;ll notice a fractional difference in game load times!
The P5 Plus&#x27;s 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5.

Chumps who want to fight alongside their summonable Spirit Ashes have to go to their own special colosseum, for nerds.

You can now once again scurry around underground death mazes in Rundown 2.0 Infection, the first Rundown shakeup added by developers 10 Chambers after the game&#x27;s March 2020 release. They plan to re-release all the others, too.
New Rundowns used to entirely replace GTFO&#x27;s levels every few months, but nowadays each new set is here to stay. How nice of the awful mutant zombie horrors to stick around.

                              <span>If you haven&#x27;t heard, Microsoft are currently trying to buy Activision Blizzard. Competition regulators from the UK, the EU and the US have been questioning the deal, so in an attempt to reassure them last month Microsoft apparently offered Sony a ten-year commitment to keep selling Call Of Duty on Playstation. Today, Xbox Head Phill Spencer announced that they&#x27;ve made a similar 10-year CoD commitment to Steam and, uh, Nintendo, on which no CoD games currently exist. 
Nintendo have signed, while Valve CEO Gabe Newell says his company won&#x27;t bother with a legal agreement, in part because they don&#x27;t believe in &quot;requiring any partner to have an agreement that locks them to shipping games on Steam into the distant future&quot;.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that mantling is better than cool swearing, and by a considerable &#x27;flipping&#x27; margin. I can&#x27;t say I disagree but ooh, hark at you, aren&#x27;t you practical. You&#x27;d be lost in cool conversations behind the school bike sheds. We must move on. This week, I ask you to being tossed to the winds of fate or telling fate to do one. What&#x27;s better: randomised item stats and perks, or saving everyone?

                              <span>2023 is shaping up to be a great time for wartime RTS games. If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren&#x27;t enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games&#x27; The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. 
In some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be &quot;in constant fluctuation&quot; throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. &quot;It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,&quot; says Becker. &quot;Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what &#x27;victory&#x27; meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.&quot;

                              <span>How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It&#x27;s a vast undertaking, and there aren&#x27;t any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12&#x27;s website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. 

The good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.

                              <span>Ixion starts by asking the question &quot;What if Homeworld was a management sim?&quot;. It then proceeds to answer that question in a comprehensive and convincing manner. Bulwark Studios&#x27; star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic&#x27;s RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.
Also like Homeworld, it&#x27;s a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead&#x27;s pride &amp; joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator. Your long journey starts here.

Let me tell you now: that is not true. I&#x27;d wager the writing and acting will be more believable in the game than in this live action short. 
At the showcase&#x27;s centre of those wasted 15 minutes was, at least, a new viscera-slick trailer of the actual Dead Island 2. So you can watch that below.

                              <span>Earlier this year, I flew to Los Angeles to learn about the making of Mina The Hollower, Yacht Club Games’ new Game Boy Color-inspired follow-up to its wildly popular series, Shovel Knight. But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.
After raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.

Final Fantasy VII is experiencing a strange identity shift. The ongoing remake is changing the original canon in bold ways while spin-offs like the 2006 PlayStation 2 game Dirge of Cerberus are being folded in for larger roles in the main story. And then there are new spin-offs, like First Soldier, the online mobile battle royale shutting down early next year, and also plans for another remake called Ever Crisis, a mobile game that will reexamine Final Fantasy VII’s timeline. With all that swirling …</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/7/2022: Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the mobile battle royale title Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. 
Last month, Naka and former Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki were arrested on suspicion of buying shares in developer Aiming after learning in advance about the team’s announcement of its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact (see the full original story below). Japanese outlet Asashi (thanks Video Games Chronicle) now reports that Naka and Sazaki are believed to have tried a similar scheme for the reveal of Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier.
Ashai notes that in February 2021, developer Ateam and Square Enix announced a partnership to develop the mobile battle royale title. Naka and Sazaki…</span>

Xbox head Phil Spencer has repeatedly promised that the juggernaut franchise will still appear on its main rival’s platforms, but that hasn’t stopped Sony from touting the loss of the series as anti-competitive to stop the deal from going through. After saying he had no problem keeping Call of Duty on Sony hardware for the long term, Spencer has now extended and formalized that promise to Nintendo and Valve. 
Last night, Spencer announced on Twitter that Microsoft has entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty back to Nintendo. In a follow-up tweet, Spencer states the series will remain on Steam …</span>

The action has the ultimate goal of blocking access to a quartet of file-hosting platforms - Fembed, Uqload, Upvid, &amp; Uvideo. This is the first attempt to have so-called cyberlockers blocked in France but if successful, could undermine operations at dozens of other sites.

The Kioxia Exceria is one of those discounted SSDs, dropping to £55, but it&#x27;s actually a fairly high-end SSD with TLC NAND and a DRAM cache. This ensures that performance remains high even in scenarios where you&#x27;re writing data fairly continuously.

                              <span>Grab your pickaxe and secure your book of procedurally-generated poetry, because Dwarf Fortress is out on Steam right, flipping, now. Bay 12 Games&#x27;s hugely ambitious colony sim, which is notionally a game about building a fortress for small, bearded humanoids, but is really an engine for generating elaborate fantasy histories and player-driven stories within them, has been in active development since 2003, with an initial launch in 2006. Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades. It&#x27;s also famously as impenetrable as its title suggests, mainly due to its ASCII visuals and unwieldy, keyboard-exclusive control scheme.

As part of that, the company is giving away one of its most notable games – Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This is the updated version of Rebellion&#x27;s best stab at AvP, which originally released in 1999, and was published by Fox Interactive.
You can grab the game by heading over to Rebellion&#x27;s storefront, where the offer is displayed proudly on the front page. There is a minor catch. You have to sign up to Rebellion&#x27;s newsletter, after which a Steam key for the game will be sent to you.

Now though, Amazon are offering the Viper Ultimate for its lowest ever price, just $59.99, fancy charging dock included. This is an awesome deal - and I&#x27;m not just saying that because I use this mouse every day (and have done for years).

                              <span>Dragon Quest Treasures is a prequel to Dragon Quest 11. It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.

On June 27, 1972, Atari, as we know it today, was born. Well, technically, it was born a few months earlier under the name Syzygy Engineering, but the name Atari started life in 1972. I know this and many more interesting facts about the company because of Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, Digital Eclipse&#x27;s love letter to the gaming giant.
Atari 50 is essentially a playable documentary, walking you through 50 years of Atari&#x27;s games, home consoles, handhelds, and PCs split into five different timelines. …</span>

                              <span>Hey Elden Ring fans, remember those colosseums you haven’t been able to enter since launch? Those doors finally open today, thanks to the arrival of a free PvP update.
Aptly dubbed Colosseum Update 1.08, the previously locked arenas in Limgrave, Caelid, and Leyndell become accessible, hosting competitive one-on-one duels, team battles, and free-for-all fights between players. It’s unclear what you’ll earn for winning other than personal glory, but it’s nice to see the fog finally lift on these mysterious locations. Check out the trailer below. 


This might be the start of a big week for Elden Ring, as it could walk away with the Game of the Year trophy during this week&#x27;s Game Awards. You can read our review of Elden Ring here.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. 
IGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that &quot;This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.&quot; First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” 
Given the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. &quot;I do think at some point we&#x27;ll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.&quot; 
Sony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.
As a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation.

The game was originally announced in 2020 (before Pentiment) and we took a look at it earlier this year. Now, however, we had a chance to go hands-on. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard for a look at this unique game that is surprisingly reliant on the tactical power of farts.

                              <span>Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.
Meet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. 


Palworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you&#x27;re catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we&#x27;re still not entirely convinced it&#x27;s a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. 
Thankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we&#x27;ll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.</span>

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
