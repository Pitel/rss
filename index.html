                              <span>Last night’s Nintendo Indie showcase gave us fresh looks at many exciting indies. Chief among them was Storyteller, a narrative-puzzle game we first saw ten years ago, and has now confirmed a release date of March 23rd. The game’s comic-strip puzzles let you remix classic stories, like Dracula, using various props, verbs and nouns. A game for all the literary nerds out there.

In a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, ZA/UM - the studio that developed Disco Elysium - confirmed the reasons several employees were fired last year. These include &quot;limited to no engagement in their responsibilities&quot;, &quot;creating a toxic work environment&quot;, &quot;verbal abuse and gender discrimination&quot;, and attempting to sell ZA/UM&#x27;s IP to other companies.

Still, it’s one to take with a pinch of salt, which probably wards off the undead too. There’s been no word from devs Arkane on whether rumblings of a Redfall beta are legit yet, but The Game Awards are only a few weeks away so we might see something announced there.

                              <span>Say what you will about Square Enix&#x27;s ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix&#x27;s enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you&#x27;re a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). 
Mostly, though, it&#x27;s your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that&#x27;s more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony&#x27;s long-dead handheld, where it&#x27;s lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I&#x27;ll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me.

As that’s less than a week away now, it’s a good job there’s loads of info about everything, from the game’s battle pass overhaul to the incoming story-based DMZ extraction mode.

The atmospheric and critically acclaimed puzzler Inscryption is headed to the Nintendo Switch platform in just a matter of weeks, following on from its warmly received launch on PC and PlayStation platforms. Publisher Devolver Digital announced the news during yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Indie World showcase.
Developed by Daniel Mullins Games (of Pony Island and The Hex fame), Inscryption is a skin-crawling creepy puzzle game that blends elements of RPGs, roguelikes, and deckbuilding card games to create a uniquely weird and nightmarish experience. Inscryption masterfully blends these various gaming genres while unfolding its own in-game lore in smart and immersive fashion. In the vein of titles such as Doki Doki Literature Club, Inscryption is a game best experienced, rather than explained.
Inscryption launches on Nintendo Switch December 1. It is available now on PC and PlayStation.

One of the concerns people have with any competitive free-to-play game is whether or not you’re playing against real people or bots. It’s not unusual to find bots across all competitive online games. Many online games use bots as a way of gently introducing the player to the game before putting them up against human opponents. For most competitive games, the longer you play, the less likely it is you’ll face AI opponents. As Marvel Snap is the hottest free-to-play mobile game on the market right now, many have been asking if there are Marvel Snap bots. And the answer is yes. In fact, you’ll face bots for quite some time.
When you first start playing Marvel Snap, you’ll go through the tutorial and what’s known as the Recruit Season Pass. In both of these instances, you’…</span>

Today, Hellspy and Hellshare are still going strong but after months of negotiations with local TV companies, significant change lies ahead. More serious problems with the music industry could derail everything.

I even went several hours thinking &quot;there&#x27;s got to be more to this:&quot; but no, it&#x27;s actually pretty straightforward.
Crack green orbs in combat
The most simple method for healing is to locate green orbs while fighting. They&#x27;ll literally appear at your feet/across the battlefield as glowing green power-ups, and interacting with them will heal you a small amount. Keep this in mind as you&#x27;re running across bigger arenas: and make a mental note of where orbs are, so you can go back to heal them like running back to a &quot;stash.&quot;

Look, any given Sonic Team production can go wrong: it&#x27;s just a fact of life. Even if something seems like a sure thing, the &quot;Sonic Cycle&quot; is jokingly shared for a reason.
An open world Sonic game that draws upon well-liked inspirations like Zelda: Breath of the Wild seemed like something that wouldn&#x27;t be disastrous at the very least. Thankfully, it isn&#x27;t. But some of it is definitely an acquired taste.

Sonic Frontiers (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed], Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S)
Developer: Sonic Team
Publisher: Sega
Released: November 8, 2022

Pokemon is such a massive IP that leaks are inevitable. No matter how much Nintendo tries to clamp down, some content creator is likely going to show off part of the game, and/or someone is probably going to buy it early from any number of retailers that break street date. Well the latter is exactly what happened, so be aware that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks are out in the wild.
As was the case with Legends, Twitter is the main source of leak sharing. Many users are getting takedown notices from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, leading to even more proliferation and more sharing. A heap of these do not have spoiler warning shields, and are just flying around. So you may want to mute anything Pokemon related if you use the platform regularly, or just stay off of it entirely for a bit if you&#x27;re really bothered by leaks.
Most Pokemon subreddits have extensive leak policies in place that prevent accidental reveals: including the &quot;main&quot; one, so you might be safe there.
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet: Leaks
The Pokemon Leaks reddit has compiled a full list so far, which is fully in text form. This is by far the safest place to look, as Twitter is sometimes inaccurate (people throwing in fake leaks), constantly riddled with takedowns, and hard to search.

Today sees the long-anticipated arrival of one of the biggest sequel&#x27;s in gaming history, as Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s magnum opus, God of War Ragnarok, launches on PlayStation platforms — And while Fathers and Boys everywhere will be eager to stand up against the coming wave of armageddon, the developer has suggested that you take a moment or two to download the sequel&#x27;s day one patch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g1wr0DfV73E
The God of War Ragnarok V2 patch features over 100 tweaks and fixes, relating to the epic title&#x27;s UI, combat, controls, visual elements, dialogue, accessibility options, menus, and much, much more. There are also specific stability fixes for both PS4 and PS5. You can check out the huge list of fixes via the official patch notes, though be warned that SSM suggests that the tweaks feature minor spoilers pertaining to abilities, creatures, and questlines. The update should download as soon as you install the game.
God of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the stellar 2018 release, God of War. The new title follows the continued adventures of an aging Kratos and his brave but somewhat inexperienced son, Atreus, as they face the coming of Ragnarok — the fabled event said to bring death and destruction to a number of gods and figures of power, while bringing chaos to the world and its climate. Quite what role our heroes will play in this event, and how it ties into the lives of their allies and enemies... Well, we&#x27;ll have to just play the game to find out.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms. Check out Chris Carter&#x27;s review right here.

                              <span>Make it a priority, Sony
When Ghost of Tsushima came out a few years back, I knew it was something special. That&#x27;s why I was waiting for the Director&#x27;s Cut/DLC package with open arms. Now I&#x27;m waiting for basically anything else. A PC port would do.
Sadly there is no confirmation at all right now that Ghost of Tsushima is even getting a PC port, but we can look at some trends and surmise that it&#x27;s likely going to happen. It was also part of that partially correct, partially incorrect Nvidia PC leak from 2021.
Here are the games Sony currently has on PC/Steam:
God of War (2018)
Spider-Man Remastered
Spider-Man: Miles Morales (out on November 18)
Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy)
Sackboy: A Big Adventure
Note that the earliest game is God of War, and it was released in January of this year. Yep, all of the above list launched in 2022. Sony is clearly serious about porting their biggest games to PC, and if Sackboy can make the cut, a lot of other titles could too.
But Ghost of Tsushima, like many other open world games, would be incredible to mess around with on PC. I mean, just imagine the mods! And the graphical options! While it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, I&#x27;m hoping we get some form of announcement in early 2023, perhaps via a State of Play. This feels like a sure thing at this point.

Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s highly-anticipated sequel God of War Ragnarok is finally in the hands of players worldwide, who now have the opportunity to continue the epic odyssey of Kratos and Atreus as they look down the barrel of the fated cataclysm known as Ragnarok — said to bring death and destruction to the world and its Gods.
God of War Ragnarok will see our protagonists come across new and familiar faces, from the returning witch Freya to the ferocious wolf-god Fenrir and the mighty, hammer-wielding warrior Thor. Among these legends of Norse mythology, Kratos and Atreus will encounter the somber Tyr, whose limp frame and addled mind belie his ultimate identity: That of the son of Odin and the defiant Aesirian God of War.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;g1wr0DfV73E
Tyr&#x27;s mythology is somewhat muddled across various localizations, but he is generally depicted as one of the sons of Odin and the half-brother to Thor, Heimdall, Baldur, and Skjöld. A variant of Mars, Tyr takes up the role of God of War for Aesir, (as opposed to Kratos&#x27; Grecian heritage), and is usually depicted as missing a hand — torn off during the binding of the wolf-god Fenrir. While Tyr does not play as large a role in mythology as his siblings, he is nevertheless associated with themes of bravery, victory, and glory.
Tyr&#x27;s appearance in God of War Ragnarok, much like his mythological origins, starts a little inauspiciously. Found imprisoned in the dwarven caves of Svartfalfheim — his mind almost entirely lost to fear and paranoia. A shadow of the glorious God of War foretold by fate. As to whether Tyr&#x27;s senses can be restored, and what role he will play in Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey toward the impending apocalypse, players will simply have to delve into the adventure for themselves.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.

A lot of core mechanics and concepts are ported over from 2018&#x27;s God of War into Ragnarok: and that includes the main currency of Hacksilver.
It can be found basically anywhere, and you&#x27;ll acquire a ton during the normal course of the story. Here&#x27;s a few ways to get some extra cash.

Look above and below, and smash everything
Standard NES and beyond retro game rules apply: smash everything. In God of War: Ragnarok, you can randomly earn cash through environmental objects, including ones on the ground and hanging on a chain in the air.
You&#x27;ll also find a lot of Hacksilver in chests. If you find yourself wanting to farm Hacksilver, go to an area you haven&#x27;t been in a while and take a new path to a sidequest. A…</span>

The Games Done Quick (GDQ) team has released a jam-packed schedule for its next speedrunning event, AGDQ 2023 — Once again, the fastest fingers in gaming will be gathering online to lay waste to a wide variety of new, classic, and debuting games, from a variety of genres, and all for a worthwhile cause.
While GDQ had planned to host the AGDQ 2023 extravaganza in a physical capacity, the team decided that Florida does not currently provide a safe enough environment, (from a social or COVID-19-related standpoint), for such a community gathering. As explained on the official GDQ Twitter, the cancellation of the Floridian venue has left the organizer out of pocket, and thus requires the event to now be held in an online capacity.

                              <span>&quot;Cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units.&quot;
Nintendo expanded upon their financial result release for the fiscal year ending in 2023 today, and provided a closer look at some of their best-performing individual IP. One such look was at amiibo, which have slowed down considerably since their 2014 debut: but still persist nonetheless.
Here&#x27;s what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about amiibo:
&quot;Next, I would like to discuss amiibo, which we launched in 2014. Tapping an amiibo to an NFC touchpoint on hardware can have all kinds of fun results in compatible games, such as the in-game appearance of the amiibo character or special items. We continue to release new amiibo products each year, and cumulative global sell-in of amiibo figures has surpassed 77 million units.&quot;

Most of it is a boiler plate statement to keep investors interested in the idea of amiibo, but reading between the lines, Nintendo has no real reason to give up on the initiative yet. They&#x27;re seemingly still selling, and the statement hints considerably at keeping the amiibo side of the business alive; at least in the short term.
If you&#x27;re curious about what the future holds for amiibo: as always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014. In the short term, the Splatoon 3 amiibo are just around the corner, and are scheduled to arrive on November 11.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll get it as part of the story
Although you&#x27;ll start off God of War Ragnarok with the two main weapons from the first game (the Blades of Chaos and the Leviathan Axe), you&#x27;ll also gain access to a third core weapon type: the Draupnir Spear.

How to unlock the Draupnir Spear
You&#x27;ll have to cruise through God of War Ragnarok for quite a bit with just those two aforementioned weapons, but roughly past the halfway point of the main narrative, you&#x27;ll get the Draupnir Spear.
You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s coming up as the quest is called &quot;Forging Destiny,&quot; located in Svartalfheim. All you need to do is scrape a few reagents off the rock in the quest area, then go down into the depths with Brok, and you&#x27;ll get the spear.
Using the Draupnir Spear
To select the Draupnir Spear, you&#x27;ll press down on the d-pad. Think of it like a &quot;neutral&quot; type weapon that doesn&#x27;t utilize the fire of the blades or the ice of the axe. In other words, it&#x27;s generally great for every situation, unless you need to whittle down a shield off an enemy (which you&#x27;ll do with the opposite type of element). One of the best ways to wield the spear is to toss an infinite amount of projectiles (hold L2) at enemies: which is also the solution to a lot of in-game puzzles.
Also, keep in mind that all three weapons do not share cooldowns for light and heavy abilities. Make it a priority to swap between each weapon and constantly unleash your cooldowns. It&#x27;s going to be hard to get the Draupnir Spear in that rotation having worked with the other two for so long, but just get in the habit of using the spear, and you&#x27;ll remember when it counts.

Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Overwatch 2 engaged over 35 million players in its first month of release, it has been revealed via Activision Blizzard&#x27;s most recent financial report. The team-based shooter sequel, which went free-to-play upon launch, hit PC and console platforms on October 4.
The number is more than double that of the title&#x27;s predecessor, which pulled in some 15 million players during its first month of release back in 2016. Of course, this comparison is somewhat suspect, given that Overwatch was a full-priced title and its sequel is freely available to all. Still, the huge launch will be popular among the folks at Blizzard, and provides a very strong base for the developer to build upon.

                              <span>Fishing is done at specific spots, not everywhere
As Sonic zooms into a semi open-world adventure with Sonic Frontiers, the &quot;greatest hits&quot; of the genre comes with it: which includes a fishing minigame. But given the historical significance (depending on who you ask) of Big the Cat, you could argue it actually fits here.
Here&#x27;s a quick guide on how to approach fishing in the game.

In Sonic Frontiers, fishing has to be done at fish icons on the map
So you can&#x27;t just get a special fishing rod item and fish anywhere on the map: but by that same token, the minigame doesn&#x27;t require you to get a unique fishing rod either. You&#x27;ll come across specific locations where you can initiate a minigame, hosted by Big the Cat. It&#x27;ll be denoted by a fish icon on the map.
Once you&#x27;re in, Big will actually g…</span>

Legendary publisher Capcom has announced that it will be partnering with Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group to co-develop a new mobile title set within the high-adventure world of Monster Hunter.
In an incredibly brief statement, which was very scant on the details, TiMi Studio Group stated its excitement at the project, noting how the new title would offer up all of the adventure and giant slaying action of smash-selling releases such as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, newly scaled down for mobile devices and offering eager hunters &quot;the freedom to hunt as they desire, anytime and anywhere.&quot;
No further information on the project was made available, including a title or release window, which suggests that the new project may be yet to even begin development. TiMi Studio has had experience with the handling of major gaming IPs before, having worked on mobile spin-offs such as Pokemon Unite, Call of Duty Mobile, and The King of Fighters: Destiny. The studio is perhaps best known for its controversial, government-bothering MMO Honor of Kings, which happens to be one of the most financially lucrative mobile games ever made.
For immediate monster-hunting thrills, Monster Hunter Rise is available now on PC and Nintendo Switch.

A little bit into Sonic Frontiers (read: around three to five hours, depending on your pacing), you&#x27;ll encounter the first big boss of the game: Giganto.
It&#x27;s actually right after this puzzle, so be on your guard: and save after that puzzle/before you go into the boss area!

Getting the Chaos Emerald to turn Super Sonic
When walking into the Giganto boss fight, you need to know one major thing right off the bat: you can&#x27;t hurt it unless you&#x27;re Super Sonic. Good thing the last Chaos Emerald you need for that is on his head!
To get up there, you&#x27;ll just sprint on either leg and use the blue rings to rocket up to his arm, then his head. You can do this freely without a timer: just be aware that his head/shoulders do have beams that can hurt you/kno…</span>

                              <span>Just do it in an app
Back in my day, our 3D Sonic games had Chao Gardens. OK, so maybe it was only really for Sonic Adventure 2, and anyone who was caught in that web at the time just eternally associates Chaos with Sonic (ha). To be fair, they have appeared in various games as mascots of sorts, and as several higher-ups in Sega have pointed out: they are present in spinoffs like Team Sonic Racing. Sadly, Sonic Frontiers continues the trend of not having an in-game Chao Garden. But I think it&#x27;s time to change that.
I know some of you are probably sighing at the idea of digging up an old 3D Sonic trend, but there&#x27;s so much potential here. Most people liked the Chao Adventure gimmick with the VMU, right? While not quite a &quot;garden&quot; per se, the idea of getting a whole extra game within a game was mind blowing at the time. I mean, the VMU was way ahead of its time too, but learning that you just bought Sonic Adventure and got a free digital Tamagotchi pet was insane: and part of the reason why the Dreamcast earned its reputation as a quirky and enduring console. All of that can be done within an app now, which can interact with any given future Sonic entry.
Funnily enough, producer for Sonic Frontiers, Takashi Iizuka, laughed when asked about Chaos earlier this year. Game Informer spoke to him with a &quot;rapid fire&quot; question format, and asked &quot;is there a Chao Garden in the game,&quot; he replied firmly with a &quot;no.&quot; The next rapid fire question was &quot;are Chaos just extinct at this point?&quot; which he also replied with &quot;no,&quot; while laughing. You can find that segment here at this timestamp (4:50).

While beauty is, obviously, in the eye of the beholder, I am a huge fan of the character designs for Street Fighter 6 — The underground flavor appeals to me, bringing dazzling life and personality to our posse of World Warriors. Still, like many fans, I was hoping to see further evidence of some classic (or &quot;nostalgia&quot;) skins, allowing our heroes and villains to rock their more iconic wardrobes.
And we have just gotten our first real look of said gear, courtesy of yer boy Ken Masters.
The newest issue of Game Informer has a stylish cover, which sees the down-and-out millionaire dropping his construction garb and donning his iconic red karate gi. This cover image marks the first official shot Capcom has released spotlighting a new character model wearing an alternate skin. Better yet, if you check out Game Informer&#x27;s &quot;Cover Story&quot; video, you can also glimpse some over-the-shoulder footage of both Chun-Li and Ryu throwing down whilst kitted out in their own classic SFII garb.
It&#x27;s somewhat early for Capcom to be showing off these nostalgia skins, especially if they are scheduled to be released as paid DLC. In my previous &quot;Do&#x27;s and Do Not Do&#x27;s&quot; article, I noted that it would be wise for the publisher to offer players something in the way of a reward for playing through Arcade/Story mode, suggesting that nostalgia costumes would be a respectable prize. While these images are no confirmation that the classic gear will be bundled with the game at launch, it&#x27;s difficult not to get excited. After all, the studio is doing a damn fine job with SF6 so far.

In the newest chapter of the epic tale surrounding the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, publisher Ubisoft has further insisted that the missing-in-action adventure remains on track for future release, despite refunds having been issued to all of the title&#x27;s pre-order customers.
First announced back in the summer of 2020, the newly visioned edition of the 2003 adventure game has been mired in development delay, leading several retailers to remove a release date or, in some cases, delist the product entirely from their websites. This week, pre-order customers noticed that their purchase had been refunded, further suggesting that the title had been quietly buried beneath the Persian dunes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;htzq7EEXQs8
Noting this, Ubisoft opened a special FAQ page, hoping to answer the fans&#x27; questions and concerns over the fragile-looking release. According to the FAQ, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake has not been canceled, and remains in development at Ubisoft Montreal, (the studio gaining control of the project from its brethren Ubisoft Mumbai). Ubisoft says that refunds were issued due to a total lack of availability on an expected release date.
Elsewhere in the FAQ, Ubisoft also notes that it has no plans to remake any other classic Prince of Persia titles. Given the rigmarole the publisher has experienced with Sands of Time to date, I can imagine that the franchise is currently on the &quot;Do Not Mention&quot; list within the studio&#x27;s walls
Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is, (apparently), in development at Ubisoft.

                              <span>Looks like there might be an MMO on the Horizon
The Horizon games have been one of the most well-loved series of recent memory, and for good reason -- the phrase &quot;robot dinosaurs&quot; alone should be enough to get even the most stubborn curmudgeons on board. While the mainline games have been of the third-person open world stealth/action varieties, now it looks like Guerilla is looking to diversify the franchise by way of an MMO set in the Horizon universe.
As per a news story from a South Korean outlet called MTN (and relayed by GamesRadar, Sony has partnered with a studio called NCSoft, best known for their title Guild Wars. According to sources close to both parties, the project is under way under the title &quot;Project H,&quot; further confirmed by job listings on NCSoft&#x27;s website.

Welcome back! It’s another Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: It&#x27;s been quite the year of disappointing video games. From CrossfireX to Babylon&#x27;s Fall, in tonight&#x27;s opening topic we discuss the worst games of the year. The crew also discusses the recent Pokemon Scarlet and Violet leaks and Square Enix&#x27;s major NFT blunder. All of that and so much more on Spot Dodge!
Video game development cycles are getting longer. The days of receiving three Uncharted games in the span of five years are over. So when a highly anticipated game ends up being aggressively mediocre, it hurts, even more, knowing you won&#x27;t see the studio&#x27;s next effort until five to ten years later. …</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a good week for monitor deals, but a lot of what we&#x27;ve looked at has been fairly expensive, from a 42-inch LG OLED for £779 or a 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide for £943. These are great monitors, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you could spend a fraction of the money and still get a brilliant monitor.
That brings us neatly to the subject of this deals post: the Dell S3422DWG, a 34-in ultrawide gaming monitor that sits at the comfortable crossroads of refresh rate and resolution: 3440x1440 and 144Hz. Rather than expensive OLED, this monitor comes with a curved VA panel, offering excellent contrast, great colours and good motion handling, while costing significantly less: just £351 when you use code GSGALLMON10 at the checkout, down from £390.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s C2 OLEDs are brilliant gaming displays at any size - and the 42-in and 48-in models are just small enough to fit onto an average to large-sized desk. That technically makes them &quot;cool gaming monitors&quot; and therefore well within my RPS deals duties. Both are now discounted from Crampton &amp; Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon (&quot;FLASH25&quot;) that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. 
That means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we&#x27;ve ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.

Stratton&#x27;s post was written all the way back in May 2020, and Gordon&#x27;s response is a doozy. “Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the DOOM Eternal Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure,” Gordon said in the post on Medium. Gordon claims that Stratton later offered a six-figure amount if he never spoke about the matter, but Gordon insists he turned the money down.

                              <span>Just over two weeks ago I predicted the ZA/uM situation would only get messier, so slap my face and call me Mystic Meg. Disco Elysium&#x27;s game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have, at least partially, offered up their side of the story on why they were fired from Disco dev studio ZA/UM in a Medium post titled &#x27;TO FANS OF DISCO ELYSIUM, CONCERNING THE SITUATION AT ZA/UM&#x27;. Short answer is: they allege fraud.

It resides in the Goldilocks Zone of creepiness: just the right amount of creepy to be considered cool, and not quite creepy enough to cause nightmares. There were quite a few things I loved about the game, but none more than that deliciously haunting opening theme that played in the main menu.

The Company Formerly Known As Facebook broke the bad news to employees via a message CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared earlier today. The job losses equate to 13% of Meta’s entire staff. Redundancies will affect staff across Meta’s global offices, including here in the UK.

                              <span>I love tidying up in games, and I’m not just talking about playing Unpacking and House Flipper, either. Any game I play with an inventory gets a regular, satisfying purge. I’m either marching to an in-game shopkeeper and holding my adventuring sack upside down, or just swiftly frisbeeing items straight into the bin. If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.
So, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too. Some simple tidying puzzles would have been enough for me, but A Little To The Left takes the idea in interesting directions through smart puzzle design.

The fantasy action RPG’s multiplayer was scuppered earlier this year when a security vulnerability that could harm anyone playing online was discovered all the way back in January. PC servers for Remastered were taken offline until a fix could be found, along with every other Dark Souls game.

They’re also touting more frequent updates to an FPS game that’s been relatively Spartan in terms of content, so far. Another game update is planned for later in 2022, which means Halo Infinite players can almost certainly expect something in December.

Valve are currently testing new expanded modding features in TF2, letting modders play with the VScript feature supported by games including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Left 4 Dead 2.

The intention to conduct an in-depth investigation was announced in a statement on the European Commission’s website, and will focus on how the deal will affect console and PC games, along with PC operating systems. This means that both the EU and UK are now holding further investigations into the potential buyout of Activision Blizzard due to concerns that Microsoft’s acquisition of the company could reduce competition within the games industry.

                              <span>If you are old enough to remember LAN parties in their heyday, you will remember how complex (and amazing) they were. If you are not, you’ve probably heard old people speak reverently about these in-person gatherings of hundreds of PCs, in hushed tones, making them seem almost mythical.

It&#x27;s not often we get to do in-person interviews these days. It&#x27;s even less frequent that we get to travel to a game studio to do them. But this might be a first, because for this interview, we actually got to go to a developer&#x27;s house.
It turns out that Max Inferno, the two-person studio making upcoming Switch game A Little to the Left, is based in Halifax, Nova Scotia — just around the corner from our Staff Writer, Kate. We couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to bag a world-exclusive chat with Lukas and Annie, the two developers of this charming tidying-up puzzle game, and we&#x27;re glad we did, because we think the game is exactly what many of us need right now: Something quiet, contemplative, and a little bit magical. Also, it&#x27;s out right now, as announced in the November 9th Indie World Showcase! What a neat bit of synergy.

The next few months just got a whole lot more exciting, thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s November Indie World Showcase, which was (as usual) packed with exciting reveals and announcements.
A whopping 22 games in total were shown off in the latest presentation, and the general consensus is pretty good; overall, a fantastic showing for Nintendo. But if you missed it, or you can&#x27;t remember quite what happened, no worries — we&#x27;re here to catch you up.

The Indie World Showcase threw a lot of stellar looking titles our way, and one that really stood out to us was GOODBYE WORLD, which launches on Switch later this month.
ISOLATION STUDIO and PM Studios, Inc. have managed to put together a game which looks to tick a lot of boxes for us. It&#x27;s got friendship, it&#x27;s got classic pixel art aesthetics, it&#x27;s got nods to the grind of game development. Combine all that with the fact that the in-game development is taking place for a suspiciously Game Boy-looking device which you can play (at this point, we&#x27;ll take a GB emulator on Switch any way we can), and you can consider us sufficiently intrigued.

Trust Devolver Digital to deliver something pretty unusual — and fun-looking. One of the surprise announcements from today&#x27;s Indie World Showcase was Pepper Grinder, a fantastic-looking pixel art sidescroller from developer Ahr Ech. And our little Game Boy Advance hearts were beating when we saw just how Pepper, the shipwrecked, swash-buckling pirate got around these levels — with a drill!
Yes! Our hearts were racing as we watched Pepper zip and zoom around with her trusty power tool. This is the high-speed sequel to Drill Dozer we&#x27;ve always wanted, and now we&#x27;re getting it in 2023! She&#x27;s even named her drill — Grinder.

Update : After appearing on the PEGI website last month, hinting at its eventual Switch release, today&#x27;s Indie World Showcase not only confirmed that Inscryption is coming to the Switch, but that it will be released on 1st December, 2022.
The psychological horror-inflected roguelike deckbuilder appeared in the showcase&#x27;s sizzle reel, but that trailer was enough to get us sufficiently spooked/excited (spookcited?)

                              <span>Leaving a legacy.
Rogue Legacy 2 is finally coming to Switch. And, like any good roguelite, it&#x27;s randomly generating onto Switch... today! Surprise! And the Switch release comes packaged with the Fabled Heroes update, meaning this release has everything you need to start building your legacy.
This genealogical adventure brings more randomised runs, character changes, and skills than you can shake a sword (or a bow and arrow, or a spear, etc.) at. This sequel to the fantastic original — which we loved on Switch — just expands on the already outstanding formula of the first game, which still stands as one of the best examples of the genre to date.

                              <span>&quot;There’s always doubt regarding the reception of a game&quot;.
Having launched earlier this year on a couple of non-Switch platforms (yeah, apparently they exist!), Sloclap&#x27;s Sifu has garnered much praise in the months since. A punishing 3D beat &#x27;em up with roguelike elements and other genre ingredients, it struck a chord with PC and PlayStation-owning action fans and has been mentioned throughout the year in the same breath as that everpresent gaming acronym, &#x27;GOTY&#x27;.
The game is now out on Switch, and the version on Nintendo&#x27;s console delivers the core experience admirably — we called it &quot;a more than valid option for Nintendo-only gamers&quot; in our 8/10 review, and were pleasantly surprised to see how well it migrated to more modest, portable hardware.

The latest addition to Pokémon Unite has been revealed and it is none other than Gen III&#x27;s gemstone-eyed Dark/Ghost-Type Sableye! The new &#x27;mon will be dropping into the game on 16th November, 2022.
Sableye was the last Pokémon to be uncovered by the datamine back in September, which also noted the additions of Clefable and Zoroark (both of which arrived in the game over the past month). Now officially confirmed by Timi Studio Group, the new battler joins the likes of Scyther and Scizor as late-comers to the Unite arena.

Ever thought inventory management in 2005’s Resident Evil 4 is like a game in its own right? Well, in the internet age, everything happens eventually, so here&#x27;s that game. In Save Room from Fractal Projects, you have a limited and specifically shaped inventory space on the left and a load of guns and stuff on the right. Simply slot the guns into the space, like a military tangram puzzle.
You also need to ensure your health meter is full and your guns are loaded at the end of the stage. Easy: eat the bad stuff then eat the healing stuff; if a gun needs ammo, put the ammo in it. You may need to combine herbs or gunpowders first, but it&#x27;s all monkey-trainable stuff. Once thus pared down, simply slot the guns and herbs into the space, like a drug dealer&#x27;s jigsaw.

                              <span>What could have been.
While Switch owners unfortunately never saw a release for FromSoftware&#x27;s critically acclaimed Dark Souls III, we&#x27;ve seen plenty from the franchise and wider &#x27;Souls&#x27; genre with the launch of Dark Souls: Remastered and the pixel art homage Blasphemous.
Well, it now appears that Thomas Feichtmeir, an artist who worked on Blasphemous, actually once pitched an idea to publisher Bandai Namco for a 2D pixel art version of Dark Souls III. As spotted by our friends over at Time Extension, the revelation was revealed on Twitter with an accompanying mock-up screenshot added to demonstrate how the game might have looked.

                              <span>Could an official set be on the way? Probably not.
Since the arrival of the Super Mario Lego sets, fans have been clamouring for an official set based on Nintendo&#x27;s The Legend of Zelda franchise.
Several projects based on the classic series have been submitted to the &#x27;Lego Ideas&#x27; initiative in the past, but none have yet seen the light of day. It seems that Lego will also no longer be accepting ideas based on The Legend of Zelda, stating in an online message that &quot;we have evaluated this IP and determined that we can&#x27;t allow submissions based on it&quot; (thanks, Brick Fanatics).

As you saw with our cover reveal yesterday, one of the most iconic characters is a centerpiece of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s story. Ken Masters, one of the two original playable Street Fighter characters, steps back into the spotlight with an all-new backstory. As soon as his new look was unveiled, the Street Fighter community had a field day pondering what happened to put Ken in the rough state he appeared, with memes popping up deeming him &quot;Hobo Ken.&quot; While at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, we spoke with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and art director Kaname Fujioka to get more details abou…</span>

                              <span>Eric Williams has been working on God of War since the first game, and his credits extend beyond Kratos&#x27; journey to titles like Darksiders and Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man, but he will always consider Sony Santa Monica home. For God of War Ragnarök, Williams put a pause on his video game consulting business to take on the director role for the highly anticipated sequel. We spoke with Williams about why God of War 2018&#x27;s director, Cory Barlog, had to convince him to take on the role, why nearly every God of War game has a new director, how he discovered he is not able to generate visuals in his mind&#x27;s eye, how the surprising casting of Richard Schiff as Odin came about, and plenty more.

The blockade was requested by several major record labels and arrives after Italy&#x27;s telecoms regulator ordered local ISPs to block the sites. Cloudflare is not pleased with the order and previously noted that such broad measures set a dangerous precedent.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s Alienware AW3423DW is my favourite ultrawide monitor, thanks to its beautiful 34-inch QD-OLED screen that offers perfect blacks, near-instant pixel response times and gorgeous colours. With wide-screen 1440p (3440x1440) resolution and a 175Hz refresh rate, it&#x27;s both detailed and responsive, and it looks the part too with a very cool space-y design. 
I was lucky enough to review one for several months for Digital Foundry - I think Dell forgot about it for a while - so I consider it my duty to inform you that it is now on sale for the first time ever, dropping from £1099 to £943 - still a big chunk of change, but a fitting Black Friday price for one of the best monitors on the market of any description, hands down.

                              <span>If your favourite PC games are competitive shooters, then a high refresh rate monitor is an essential upgrade in my eyes - the reduced input lag and improved visual clarity makes a huge difference in games like Counter-Strike, Valorant, Fortnite and Call of Duty. 144Hz and 165Hz monitors used to be the norm, but now even faster monitors are becoming quite affordable - including this 280Hz Acer monitor that&#x27;s dropped to £180 at Laptops Direct, down from an original price of £275.

There’s something about a physical controller, custom built to emulate the action the game revolves around, that lends games a level of credibility you lose the second you try and play it with a regular pad. Playing Guitar Hero with an Xbox 360 controller feels like trying to paint a bedroom wall using a spoon. You’ll get there eventually, but if anyone spots you through a window they’ll rightly assume you’re some kind of deviant.

                              <span>Speedrunning charity event Awesome Games Done Quick is returning in January, and there’s plenty of PC runs among its freshly announced preliminary schedule. Notable standouts this time around are PowerWash Simulator, which might well be my personal GOTY contender, and a bonus appearance from cutesy cyberpunk cat sim Stray. There’s also a Google Stadia run of nautical indie action-adventure Wavetale, just a week before the streaming platform closes for good.

                              <span>The other week I played a short demo for the upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?


The day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game&#x27;s special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.

                              <span>Blacktail is a complicated, first-person adventure when you play a lil witch. Well, a witch in training, sort of. A witcheen. Baba Yaga has been forced to live in the forest having been accused of witchcraft, so it seems like one of those self-fulfilling prophecy deals.
It&#x27;s a very brightly coloured, fantastical world, this forest you live in, and you&#x27;re dropped in media res. I thought that hands-on preview I got would be quite a casual gadabout talking to a cute dragon and what have you, but in fact it was difficult, and weird, and very opaque in the best way. The res in question included treasure chests with teeth and talking pine-cone spirits, and exploding fireflies. But you&#x27;re an archer, too, and I really, really hate using arrows in first-person, and I don&#x27;t think that will change.

The shotgun blast of marketing speak erupted from the company’s third quarter earnings results for the year, setting off car alarms, shattering glass, and triggering journalists’ Google Alerts. You can interpret “full premium release” to mean an actual game that costs $70, or an expansion packaged and sold during the ritually observed Call Of Duty release window. I choose to sit on the fence for the next 12 months, carefully raising one eyebrow so I don’t topple over.

                              <span>How To Say Goodbye starts with someone dying. It’s not shocking or distressing; quite the opposite. The person died in a hospital bed surrounded by their closest friends and family, and after they&#x27;ve passed on the group begins to share stories and memories from when they were alive. Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. 
This is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children&#x27;s pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.

You probably also noticed that BioWare shared some concept art of an in-construction mass relay from the next Mass Effect game, along with a snippet of jumbled audio for people to download. Enterprising Shepard stans set to work cleaning up the noise to see if anything meaningful was held within and, lo and behold, there was a short message from everyone’s favourite asari scientist Liara T’Soni.

Popeye was the best thing to ever happen to spinach, and all it had to do was imply that eating a can would let you punch a train. Why did no other vegetable consider this? Children and adults alike would love to be just like their favorite village brawler. Why do processed meat sticks get the Macho Man’s elbow drop of approval but not bok choy?
We should really see more advergames. Let me tell you, I hate advertising. Seeing it in video game form, on the other hand, really lets you appreciate how insipid it is. Cool Spot had nothing to do with 7up, and McDonald’s Treasureland Adventure didn’t have a hamburger in sight. UFO Kamen Yakisoban has it right. It is all about a buckwheat-fueled tokusatsu hero getting all noodly with his prey. Yes!

Skyrim is one of the best-selling games of all time, and for good reason -- its expansive map, detailed cities, and compelling questlines make for some of the most immersive, fantasy-themed gaming you&#x27;re gonna get. Skyrim also has a robust modding community, so though aspects of the game might be dated now, you can make some changes to get your gaming experience to your exact specifications. If even that isn&#x27;t enough to keep your Skyrim playthroughs feeling fresh, then maybe it&#x27;s time to move onto something new. Thankfully, there are plenty of games out there that are perfectly-suited to fill the Skyrim-shaped hole in your heart.

As part of its newly published financial details, Nintendo has announced that it is entering into a joint venture with mobile gaming company DeNA. In a statement that, frankly, reads like it was written by an algorithm, Nintendo announced that it hopes to both expand user communication and improve upon all the services delivered by the &quot;Nintendo Account&quot; system.
&quot;With the integrated hardware-software model at the core of its business, Nintendo also strives to provide enhanced experience and service outside of its dedicated gaming system,&quot; begins perhaps the most buzzword statement in existence. &quot;In order to provide this experience in a holistic manner, Nintendo is working to maintain and expand its relationship with consumers primarily through Nintendo Account. Based on the expertise accumulated over the seven-plus years and the experience of co-developing multiple services based on Nintendo Account, Nintendo and DeNA will advance their partnership and establish a joint venture company.&quot;
&quot;With the objective to strengthen the digitalization of Nintendo’s business, the joint venture company will research and develop, as well as create value-added services to further reinforce Nintendo’s relationship with consumers.&quot;
This is not Nintendo&#x27;s first dealings with DeNA, the latter having been closely involved with multiple Nintendo mobile games, including Fire Emblem Heroes, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Super Mario Run, and Mario Kart Tour. DeNA is, in particular, responsible for the integration of player accounts and in-game communications. As partners, the two companies hope to research and develop more advanced technology and software for future Nintendo mobile titles and/or applications.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t overthink it
I said this earlier today, but there are a few Sonic Frontiers puzzles that are worth sharing the solution to. This one is actually really easy, but I was mashing through the explanation and missed it the first time around.
So midway through the first island (so a few hours into the game), you&#x27;ll come across the quest/mission Spring is in the Air, alongside of Amy. You&#x27;ll know it when you see it, because it looks like a Mario Party minigame.
Sonic Frontiers: Spring is in the Air puzzle solution guide
Your job is to weed the area with the Cyloop ability (Triangle/Y), by creating energy loops that cut the grass. Basically, just create modest-size Cyloops (you&#x27;ll learn the max length rather quickly if you try it here) over and over until you have enough clear percentage. Smaller loops are enough to get the job done, and they help minimize your ability to run into bee enemies (you have three lives to finish Spring is in the Air until you have to restart).
As for the bees: one trick I&#x27;ve always used throughout the NES era (especially against bosses that have bouncing ball attacks you need to dodge during the fight) is to focus one eye on any threats: while making headway with your other eye. Keeping that focus on the bees will ensure that you won&#x27;t run out of lives, but you do eventually need to clear enough weeds out.
The game tells you that you can Cyloop the flowers, but don&#x27;t really bother. It&#x27;s faster if you just focus on getting as many weeds as possible, moving north in sequence; but if you can hit any flowers in the meantime, you may as well.

                              <span>The main islands all have something similar
People are making their way through Sonic Frontiers starting today: so I decided to take a note of anything that might be even remotely tricky. While running through most of the open world is self-explanatory (and easy to do because of the degree of control you have over Sonic), there&#x27;s a few errant puzzles here and there that folks might Google. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the water draining area.
[gallery link&#x3D;&quot;file&quot; ids&#x3D;&quot;349317,349318,349319&quot;]
Drain the water to move on puzzle solution
After reaching the second island and speaking to Knuckles several times, you&#x27;ll come across a giant drain. The objective marker will aim at a turret, but you can&#x27;t otherwise interact with it: which might be confusing at first.
To fix that, walk around the water away from the turret, and use the Cyloop (Triangle/Y) to create a ring around the artillery shell on the pedestal. It&#x27;ll magically float above Sonic&#x27;s head, and a timer will appear: asking you to load the turret and fire it in time.
Just quickly walk over to the turret, and the shell will load in. Aim up and look directly at the structure attached to the chain/plug, and fire right into the center of the &quot;eye.&quot; The area will drain and the story will move on!

So Sonic Frontiers is out today, and there&#x27;s a lot little nuances that don&#x27;t matter (especially with the variety of combat abilities), and there&#x27;s some that do. Making sure that you remember that the Light Speed Dash ability even exists can be huge in terms of minute-to-minute Frontiers play.
Unlike a heap of powers in Sonic Frontiers, that need to either be unlocked via the skill tree or story progression, you can Light Speed Dash immediately. All you need to do is press the left analog stick in when you&#x27;re near a trail of rings, and Sonic will instant micro-dash (without a boost meter requirement) toward said ring formation. You can use the Light Speed Dash to get some extra air when Sonic is falling, collect a lot of rings quickly during a fight, or solve some puzzles.
I literally played hours of the game not recalling that this technique existed. I even quickly an inadvertently did a load screen tutorial sequence with it, and still forgot about it for a bit! Given that it&#x27;s largely not needed to get around (double-jumping and a breezy R2/RT dash take care of that), it is easy to block out of your mind.
But like me, you&#x27;ll probably come across some situation where you&#x27;re falling and quickly remember: the Light Speed Dash exists.

Brian and Kyle talk about where the game excels, where it has shortcomings, and look at it on two different platforms: Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. You can read Brian&#x27;s full Sonic Frontiers review right here.

                              <span>After a lengthy Street Fighter 6 hands-on session and a few interviews at Capcom&#x27;s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, I am in the back room of a small sandwich shop overlooking the Higashiyokobori River. As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we&#x27;ve been playing, he asks if I&#x27;ve enjoyed what I&#x27;ve played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.
I let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre. The director nods along with a smile until I mention how I don&#x27;t feel the Modern Controls (which simplify the overal…</span>

The cover art, created by designer Goro Tokuda, features one of the original World Warriors, Ken, sporting his new look. Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken&#x27;s rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what&#x27;s happening with one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic characters.
While there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V&#x27;s disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…</span>

The most significant reveal is a glimpse at two new creatures, called Great Tusk and Iron Treads. At first glance, they look a lot like Donphan (a Pokémon that has been confirmed for the new games), but it’s unclear how they’re related. They could be new regional forms, evolutions, or something entirely new.
The trailer also showed a sneak peek at the Scarlet Book and Violet Book, two tomes detailed further on Pokémon’s official website. They’re records from an old expedition and have notes and drawings of old Pokémon, including the new Donphan-esque creatures reve…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers is available now, marking a new era for the iconic Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. While much of the 3D action remains intact through Sonic Frontiers, the arena in which much of that action takes place is a massive departure. The open-zone setup gives players large areas in which to run, fight, and explore, but the game also presents players with linear Cyber Space stages that veer much closer to the action levels players are used to. With so much to do in Sonic Frontiers (I spent more than 30 hours clearing as much as I could off the map), I wanted to give players some tips to help them squeeze the most fun out of the Blue Blur&#x27;s enjoyment.

Jde vesměs o řady procesorů AMD 14h (Bobcat) / 15h (Bulldozer) / 16h (Jaguar/Puma) z předRyzenové éry, a to v souvislosti s jejich zastaralým mechanismem SMP inicializace, kterou za poslední roky nikdo neportoval do novější architektury Corebootu a z upstreamu projektu tak definitivně zmizí.</span>

                              <span>Ebay&#x27;s TAKEIT10 code offers a 10% discount on a wide range of PC components and peripherals, but I was tickled by this deal on an Integral 480GB SSD, which brings this sizeable drive down to just £24. 
That&#x27;s a solid £5 below the price of the same drive on Amazon, and well into bargain buy territory for anyone that wants to cheaply and easily add more storage to their desktop or laptop. If you have any old laptops that are still running on hard drives, for example, then this could be an awesome low-cost upgrade!

This little gadget has a simple premise: fifteen customisable keys, each with a little LCD screen behind it, that can be bound to accomplish a wide range of things from scene switching in OBS and monitoring your computer&#x27;s vitals to launching programs or muting your microphone. Normally the Stream Deck costs £150, but today it&#x27;s down to £90 at Amazon UK.

                              <span>Compared to many of the latest FPS offerings out there, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a fossil. It&#x27;s such a simplistic looking game, right? A bit bland and archaic, lacking that colour and pop that the likes of Apex Legends and Valorant possess. But to pass it off as dull and basic is to do the game a disservice, as it&#x27;s more refined than basically any of its competitors.

                              <span>I, like many people I know these days, will only watch a YouTube video if it&#x27;s either less than 5 minutes or more than an hour long. YouTube evolved a while ago into a platform for long-form video essays, and I for one am happy about it. Even better: Jenny Nicholson just released an almost four hour video on an uncompleted attraction in Utah called Evermore. Evermore is a sort of theme park-slash-immersive-theatre that appears to have been beset both by uncontrollable world events and bad management, but I still want to go because it looks pretty fun(ny). 
I did think about what games I would like to become immersive experience theme parks in this kind of vein, though, and I gotta say... I&#x27;m coming up empty.

There’s also new lore rooms based on locations from these games, which is where you’ll find the weapons stored. You can watch some of the costumes and weapons in action in the trailer below.

                              <span>Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s multiplayer - not including Warzone 2.0 - brings out the best of COD&#x27;s excellent gunplay on an array of colourful maps that largely deliver. And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn&#x27;t make it an athletics competition.
And while the game&#x27;s multiplayer is a slick refinement of what&#x27;s come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player. Oh, and make sure you&#x27;ve got the game installed on an SSD...

                              <span>I don’t know about you, but a hectic working and family schedule means my time for games is way more limited than it used to be. That’s why I’m intrigued by Chop Goblins, a “microshooter” from Dusk and Gloomwood developer David Szymanski that’s coming to Steam on January 2nd, 2023. Szymanski says Chop Goblins’ campaign can be finished within a single sitting of around 30 minutes. Appropriately enough, it’s all about time travel.

                              <span>There’s a war going on between instalments in the Battlefield series, and it looks like Battlefield 1 is coming out on top for now. The World War One FPS has been spotted nestled in Steam’s top ten best-selling games rankings (thanks, Emopulse), although it&#x27;s since slipped out again. Battlefield 1’s also set a record over the weekend for its all-time highest concurrent player numbers, reaching more than 50,000 players in the past 24 hours. I say, tip top.

Windows Central and the XboxEra podcast both say they’ve heard the release window from sources. That’s not all, as details of the fantasy action RPG’s release could be announced on December 8th at The Game Awards, according to both sets of sources. These include pre-orders opening during the show, and a February 2023 open beta.

Forget about other games for the moment though, because one developer’s bringing The Bible itself to Steam. The appropriately named Bible Games are releasing a fully voiced version of the good book on November 14th, complete with trivia quizzes to check your biblical knowledge. You can watch the surprisingly dramatic trailer below.

                              <span>Scorn is an abstract game that is difficult to decipher. Even after seeing credits, players are left in an uncomfortable but memorable state of mind that defies clear explanation. To try and develop some context, we spoke with the game&#x27;s director, Ebb Software&#x27;s Ljubomir Peklar, via e-mail to try and get some more insight into the bizarre experience. Unsurprisingly, much is meant to be left to the players&#x27; imagination, but Peklar did offer some details, like how it managed to create something so abstract, some of the incidental imagery that occurred, and the best movie from the Aliens franchise.

The streaming giant revealed the news in a tweet that&#x27;s light on details but states it&#x27;s partnering with Gears developer The Coalition. Based on the tweet&#x27;s wording, it sounds like the animated show will come after the movie&#x27;s release. It may not stop there, as Netflix also says there&#x27;s “potential for more stories to follow!”

The last NFL Blitz was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in January 2012. Even then, it was considered a retro revival title developed by Madden studio EA Tiburon. Before that, we hadn&#x27;t received a proper NFL-licensed Blitz title since Midway&#x27;s NFL Blitz 20-03 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. Despite EA Sports acquiring the license from Midway during its 2009 liquidation, the NFL has largely seemed averse to the hard-hitting arcade-style gameplay of the Blitz series.
In August, Arcade1Up, the company behind various arcade replicas, including other Midway classics like NBA Jam and Mortal Kombat, announced the franchise&#x27;s return through NFL Blitz Le…</span>

A few hours after posting the teaser, a fan decoded the background audio to reveal a conversation between what sounds like Liara and the Geth. BioWare has acknowledged this breakthrough by releasing a new version of the clip with clean audio. You can listen to it in the tweet below. 
Thank you to all the agents who decoded the footage. Here’s a clean transmission 👀 https://t.co/iADrTHnU6s pic.twitter.com/ALNBNNM05a

Original Story: November 7 is N7 Day for Mass Effect fans, meaning all eyeballs are on BioWare in hopes it’ll release any info on its upcoming Mass Effect sequel. So far, the developer has satisfied that demand by releasing a brief video tea…</span>

In Sonic Frontiers, Sega finds the intersection of the series’ linear past and its “open-zone” future, paying capable service to both eras of the franchise. The open Starfall Islands offer engaging exploration, while linear Cyber Space stages deliver the familiar speed-based Sonic experience.

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s premium broadcasters use conditional access systems to restrict viewing to paying customers and prevent piracy.

A second scenario has Russia equally worried - free premium TV for all.

                              <span>It shouldn’t be a big ask from gamers to have more gender-inclusive pronoun options in a video game, especially in RPGs. One producer at Square Enix thinks helping gamers feel welcome by including non-binary pronouns is such a small ask that it was a no-brainer to have it be a part of his new game.

                              <span>The original Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG grew out of a connection to miniature wargames, so it’s little surprise that the DNA of tactical tabletop play has remained bound to the long-running franchise ever since. The current edition of D&amp;D supports tremendous flexibility in playing out combat how you like, including through tabletop miniature play, allowing big battles to flow out from ongoing campaign storylines in your weekly sessions. However, perhaps your group is more into combat than interconnected storylines. Or, more likely, you sometimes just want a break from the campaign planning to have a focused evening of combat. If that’s the case, WizKids’ new Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Onslaught game should be on your radar.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the latest episode embedded below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

                              <span>God of War Ragnarok is out next week and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, developer Santa Monica Studio has revealed more than 70 accessibility features in the game. 
PlayStation has been pushing the importance of accessibility in gaming more and more with each new release and Ragnarok is no different. The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. 


Santa Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that &quot;enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs&quot; and the list is a sight to behold. It includes plenty of presets, too, which could make it easier for players to easily get the game started in a way that makes the experience better for them. Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. 
There are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more. If you&#x27;re interested in what accessibility features are in Ragnarok, be sure to check out the full blog post.

                              <span>The composer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Sarah Schachner, has revealed that she has parted ways with the game and the free-to-play battle royale Call of Duty: Warzone (and likely the upcoming Warzone 2). As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game&#x27;s audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn&#x27;t name this person in her announcement. 
News of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner&#x27;s departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016&#x27;s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. 
&quot;I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,&quot; her statement reads. &quot;Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don&#x27;t see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it&#x27;s been taken out of my hands. While I don&#x27;t have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.&quot; 
She then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game&#x27;s score, including mixer Frank Wolf, &quot;creative vision&quot; Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B. Gordy.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember now if it was Monster Prom or Dream Daddy that introduced me to the dating sim genre, but Monster Prom was definitely my first dating sim hybrid, a sub-genre I&#x27;m now more than a bit obsessed with. Other favourite examples of mine include last year&#x27;s Boyfriend Dungeon (a dating sim and dungeon crawler), Max Gentlemen: Sexy Business (a dating and business sim), and HuniePop (a dating sim and match-3 puzzle game). Monster Prom is a dating sim and competitive multiplayer party game, where up to four players vie to romance attractive monsters and invite them to the school dance.

RimWorld is the more direct influence, really. Instead of a planet&#x27;s surface, your little blobby torso people are stuck on a spaceship, which you need to rebuild around them using a fleet of robots as they gradually wake up from stasis. If you know the genre well, it will be reminiscent of several games, but its balance of survival, management, and creative building makes for a refreshingly forgiving experience at the current default settings.

                              <span>Horror series The Dark Pictures Anthology is drawing its first season to a close with the arrival of supernaturally bereft slasher The Devil In Me on November 18th, and a new trailer lets us meet all the cheerful faces we’ll undoubtedly see brutally murdered at some point. Handily, it’s made me realise that Paul Kaye – known for his Game Of Thrones role as resurrectionist Thoros of Myr, and for being mortally annoying as Dennis Pennis in the Nineties – is playing shock doc director Charlie. Kaye’s nonchalant accent seems like a great fit, as you’ll see in the trailer below.

                              <span>Players of 343 Industries’ futuristic open-world shooter Halo Infinite will be able to bask in the glow of ray traced graphics when the game’s season 3 arrives next year. The inclusion was announced at AMD’s recent, horrifically named AMD Presents:together we advance_gaming livestream, where the company showed off their latest Radeon RX graphics cards. Season 3 of Halo Infinite is expected to launch on March 7th, 2023.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been an interesting exercise playing Triangle Strategy and Tactics Ogre: Reborn in quick succession lately. I&#x27;ve now played both Square Enix strategy RPGs for around six hours apiece now - starting with Tactics Ogre for my preview the other week, and following it up with a Triangle-shaped chaser. I didn&#x27;t have any history with either game before now, but it&#x27;s become increasingly apparent that they&#x27;re effectively cut from the same tile-based cloth. And I mean, exactly the same. They&#x27;re so similar, in fact, that it&#x27;s kinda hilarious Square are releasing them so close together on PC, with Tactics Ogre&#x27;s release on November 11th following little more than a month after Triangle Strategy. 
At the same time, though, their approach to story-telling couldn&#x27;t be more different, and comparing and contrasting them like this one after the other has been both fun and enlightening. Triangle Strategy, for example, is about 80% cutscene, 20% fighting for its first six hours, while Tactics Ogre is pretty much the opposite. And yet… I think I sort of prefer Triangle Strategy? Let me explain.

                              <span>When Team Ninja&#x27;s Soulslike action-RPG Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced not long ago, I thought: &quot;Wow, that looks like my sort of jam&quot;. A PS5 demo came out and I only got to spend all of five minutes with it before life got in the way. I never got to truly taste the jam, which was quite sad. So, colour me very excited when I got to spend a good couple of hours battling through two short hands-on demos. I got battered by a big pig, prickled to death by a massive porcupine, and aggressively mauled by a large tiger. And I&#x27;d say I had a whale of a time. There was no killer whale in the demo, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out for the full release.

They’re due to air tonight, November 4th, in the US, and in the early hours of tomorrow morning for people on the other side of the Atlantic. That leaves enough time to place your bets on who it’ll turn out to be.

                              <span>We finally have AMD’s answer to the Nvida RTX 40 series: the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the red team’s first graphics cards build on the RDNA 3 architecture. These are both high-end GPUs, set to cost $899 and $999 respectively when they release on December 13th, but you’ll note those prices are oodles cheaper than the £1269 / $1199 RTX 4080 and the £1679 / $1599 RTX 4090.
They’re also structurally distinct from the current Radeon RX 6000 cards to an extent that, frankly, is quite surprising to see from AMD GPUs. RDNA 3 uses a Ryzen CPU-inspired chiplet design, where the GPU is split up into different sections, and the new media engine is engineered for the 4K gaming monitors of the future as much as it is for current PC hardware.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is morish. Pulsating lights stretch in a vertical column from the top to the bottom of my screen, scattering into deadly particles like notes played on an accordion of cosmic destruction. Fireworks burst in every corner, thanks to the evolved version of my diamond-spewing runetracer weapon that’s now called ‘NO FUTURE’. Monsters go pop by their thousands. Flaming meteors still abound.
Vampire Survivors is an arcade-style survivathon about weaving through fields of enemies as your weapons automatically obliterate the oncoming hordes. It’s still about collecting upgrades until you’re the locus of an unstoppable death machine, and now that it’s left early access that death machine comes in more colours and more flavours. There are new maps to conquer, new characters to conquer with, and new secrets to uncover. If you haven’t played since the early access launch then yes, it’s worth checking out the new stuff. If you haven’t played at all, then God yes, please check out all the stuff. Or like, most of it.
Vampire Survivors is still morish. Up to a point.

This monitor costs £209 at Amazon UK right now, but it&#x27;s a solid £30 less at Currys when you use code FNDDGAMING at the checkout - neat.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5 5600X processor is the pick of the litter when it comes to value for money - perhaps excepting the slightly cheaper 5600 - and today it&#x27;s down to £170, a full £110 off its UK RRP. While Ryzen 7000 offers better performance, it also comes with steeper requirements - like DDR5 RAM, a 600-series motherboard and a much bigger budget. Here&#x27;s why we rate this particular CPU at this discounted price.

                              <span>Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. 
It all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. 
The second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. 
I enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”</span>

                              <span>Hideo Kojima has finally addressed the conspiracy theories revolving around him and Blue Box Game Studios&#x27; Abandoned and in short, it&#x27;s a nuisance for him, unsurprisingly. 
Abandoned was announced with a short teaser back in 2021 as a game being developed for PlayStation 5 and PC. Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.
From there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game. Some believed that Kojima actually was Kahraman on the basis that both their first names start with &quot;H&quot; and both their last names start with &quot;K.&quot; Plus, people thought Blue Box was meant to ti…</span>

To call the 2018 God of War a sequel almost does it a disservice. Yes, it was a continuation of Kratos’ original multi-game journey, but it placed him and a new family in a foreign world to reflect on his past and try to secure his future. Kratos’ journey to connect to his son while battling a new legion of distrustful gods was a revelation in both video game storytelling and action, setting a high bar for the inevitable sequel. Ragnarök may lack the unique impact of the prior game, but everything that worked so well the…</span>

Without spoiling the ending of Village, the story left off in a way that created some big, interesting questions about the future of Resident Evil. From its beginning, the series has never claimed a singular protagonist, but moving forward, it seemed Ethan’s daughter Rose was going to be an important character to the franchise and whatever narrative direction a potential Resident Evil IX might follow. The Shadows of Rose DLC offers the first chance to play as Rose while filling in a small story gap that arguably did not need filling. Even with a somewhat benign…</span>

As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in terms of graphics modes for this game, and that&#x27;s great – the more options, the better! Regardless of where you play or how you play, it sounds like you&#x27;re in for a good time based on the first five hours of the game. You can read what we thought about those first hours in our God of War Ragnarök spoiler-free impressions here.

                              <span>Rainy Season is a game that speaks to that universal feeling of having your plans scuppered by inclement weather. We&#x27;ve all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio&#x27;s hour-long narrative game, it&#x27;s a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. 
Unfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he&#x27;s got to face a day stuck inside his grandma&#x27;s house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that melee combat’s a crucial part of Bethesda’s ageing but beloved fantasy RPG The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Flailing wildly at enemies with a big sword, axe, or warhammer, jostling them about with your implement of doom like armour-clad sausages frying in a pan, never seems to get old. What if you could do that while being more ethically sound, in a non-lethal way? Hold onto your butts because vanilla Skyrim modder drumfire has come up with the solution. It’s a mace that’s, well, Mace.

                              <span>Following our Halloween special last week, The Electronic Wireless Show podcast today moves away from the monstrous to the relatable (which in our case does not preclude monstrosity). We talk about the characters that we relate to most, and also I find a way to mention Saturnalia again. Tune in next week to see if I can keep up my streak!
Matthew being away this week means that Nate takes on the role of the anti-Matthew, and we speculate about which games we think Matthew would probably find relatable. For myself and Nate the themes include sadness and drudgery. But there&#x27;s good news, because Nate has remembered to make me a Cavern Of Lies this week! Hooray!

                              <span>Gaming mice love a Black Friday sale, they do. Every November there’s a glut of discounted peripherals, and not just the sad plastic lumps that retailers won’t be able to sell otherwise – we’re talking real quality desk rats. This guide to the best early Black Friday gaming mouse deals confirms as much, as even with the big day itself not until the 25th, loads of new and old favourites are available with substantial savings.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been playing an awful lot of Overwatch 2 recently. As you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve played either of Blizzard&#x27;s near-identical hero shooters, Overwatch 2 lets you queue up for a match as a particular hero role, which ensures balanced team compositions but also can mean a wait of several minutes before you get into a match. Cue me scouring my Steam Library a few days ago for a quick little time-waster to fill those gaps. And after a few failed attempts, I discovered it. Or, more accurately, rediscovered it.

                              <span>I don’t know about you, but I’m not very good at reading Ye Olde Ynglishe. The letters are all curly, and my vision’s already a bit rubbish to begin with. Like a lot of specialised fonts, I find calligraphy awkward to read at best and virtually illegible at worst. That’s why I always appreciate when games make an effort to make text as accessible as possible. Case in point: Obsidian’s upcoming medieval mystery, Pentiment, which has an option to swtich to easy to read fonts baked in. Verily, thou hast mine thanks.

                              <span>If our glowing Signalis review has you hungry for more retro-styled survival horror, do also check out the new demo for Heartworm. Inspired by classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, Heartworm is neat even before you learn it&#x27;s almost entirely made by one person. It offers good times exploring a spooky house, bad times possibly trapped inside a neighbourhood in a VHS tape, and a very cosy time hanging out in the safe room. It is a lovely safe room.

                              <span>Only last week I was praising games that wanna be weird, and as such I must commend the weirdness of The Chant, a third-person action adventure where a retreat akin to Jared Leto&#x27;s definitely-not-a-cult finds itself crashing into a weird nightmare realm akin to the Upside Down from Stranger Things. The thing is, if anything I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s weird enough. If you&#x27;re going to do a game where the main character uses flaming witchhazel sticks to lash energy-crystal monsters with vagina-flower faces, my view is that you go hard or go home.

Now though, a new trailer gives a proper glimpse of what Holmes and Watson will be getting up to when they take on H.P. Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos, once again for the very first time. Have a watch below, and try not to get lost in an ethereal netherworld inhabited by malevolent, sleeping gods.

PC owners in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore can now play their Android games on their desktop or laptop. It’s not exactly a replacement for the Google Stadia streaming service that’s shutting down in January, but if you play a lot of Android games on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook then at least it’s an option.

                              <span>Good ol’ Ian Hitman is still assassinating away in Hitman 3’s second year of extra stuff to do, and he’s getting ready to huff, puff, and blow some targets away on November 10th. IO Interactive shared their roadmap for what’s ahead this month in Hitman 3, with a new escalation contract that takes its inspiration from one of my kids’ favourite stories, the Three Little Pigs. You can catch up on what’s in store for Ian this month by watching the video below.

That’s when Call Of Duty: Black Ops developers Treyarch will be delivering the military shooter’s ranked play, although there’s no more intel on when exactly we’ll be able to dolphin-dive in. The window for ranked play’s arrival was tweeted by Treyarch alongside some more things to expect from Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, such as competitive modes, a Top 250 leaderboard, and visible skill ratings.

                              <span>Ghost Song is a 2D Metroid-like that&#x27;s always a feast for the eyes, but a frequent frustration for your head and hands. Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It&#x27;s a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland&#x27;s Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you&#x27;ll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you&#x27;re here.
But Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo&#x27;s Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry&#x27;s nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you&#x27;d hope.

                              <span>When it comes to DDR4 RAM, the market has decided that 3200MT/s CL16 is the perfect spec: noticeably faster than early DDR4-2133, 2400 and 2666, while being significantly cheaper than higher-end 3400, 3600 and 4000 kits. Normally you&#x27;d expect to pay around £60 for a 16GB dual-channel kit of DDR4 RAM hitting this spec, but today you can get a Kingston Fury Beast 16GB kit for just £48.64 at CCL in the UK.

I adore my collections of GTA clown cars but it&#x27;s no match. This week, we must choose between two slightly wistful things, one that&#x27;s come and gone and one that&#x27;s confined to a single game. And, ah, I cannot deny having been influenced by last week&#x27;s vote for one of these options. What&#x27;s better: feelies, or RULES OF NATURE? Vote now!

                              <span>Because I have. Maybe too much. 2816.6 hours of Dota 2, according to Steam, and that doesn’t count the days I’ve spent flying out to watch more talented people play it in arenas. It’s easy to get lost in, is Dota, and not just in the bad ways – even after a series of crap matches, it’s so easy to sink further into its incredible depth, its neverending wizard fight nuances, that it could be hour number 2820 before coming back up for air.

                              <span>Without a doubt, Elden Ring has spent hours of this year floating around my mind, like a parasitic gargoyle making a nest out of my stringy brain matter. Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I&#x27;m still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I&#x27;d reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.
Honestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don&#x27;t get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.

                              <span>A new month dawns with another Genshin Impact update, and the arrival of version 3.2 today brings a fresh character in the form of Dendro archon Nahida. Also known as Lesser Lord Kusanali, Nahida is the god of Sumeru, one of Genshin Impact’s seven kingdoms. She’s also the youngest living god, at a very sprightly 500 years old. There’s loads of info about Nahida and her abilities in the trailer below, so watch away.

Daemonhunters was released in May this year under the Frontier Foundry label, and we rather enjoyed it at the time. It seems as though, in the grand tradition of Remington shaver ads, Frontier liked the game so much that they bought the company.

                              <span>By far the best thing about the RTX 4090 – which is otherwise a bit of a GPU boondoggle – is that is supports DLSS 3. This next-gen version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler not only boosts performance with render resolution trickery but also adds entirely new, AI-generated frames of its own, smoothing out visuals even further. Fewer than 40 games are confirmed to implement it so far but that number is growing, with Nvidia today announcing that Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales will include DLSS 3 when it launches for PC on November 18th.

The new trailer for shooty alternate universe action RPG Atomic Heart is a bit of a trip, frankly. Barrelling along at the speed of Sonic The Hedgehog, you can just about make out some weird looking Soviet robots, head-splitting mutants, and what seemed to be a truck plummeting towards towering futuristic architecture. Watch the eye-meltingly speedy trailer below, you’ll probably need some bugeye goggles afterwards to recuperate your peepers.

It’s also the only Rusty Lake game so far to include 3D environments. You can snag a glimpse of the timey-wimey, multidimensional eeriness by watching the trailer below.

Original story: The Last of Us TV series will premiere in a little over two months if HBO&#x27;s page for the show is any indication. 
HBO Max subscribers began to notice that on the page for The Last of Us series on HBO, a description of the show says it premieres on January 15, as reported by Eurogamer. The publication reports that only U.S. subscribers are seeing this January 15 premiere date in the show&#x27;s description so I opened up the HBO Max app on my phone to check and sure enough, it&#x27;s there.

I don’t envy the developers of puzzle games. They have to create puzzles formidable enough to be challenging and exciting, but not so much that the player feels more burdened than empowered. The best walk that line almost perfectly, and The Entropy Centre is chock full of them. But The Entropy Centre is more than its brain teasers, and it’s that “more” where the game hits its stumbling blocks. Despite that, its core design is unlike anything I’ve ever played, and genre enthusiasts will find that this game be…</span>

                              <span>Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality&#x27;s Soviet Union, will be released this February. 
More specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. 
Check out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can&#x27;t wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it&#x27;s hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we&#x27;ll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. 
Atomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you&#x27;re interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it&#x27;s one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. 
For additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish&#x27;s official website, where there&#x27;s info about the game&#x27;s different editions available for preorder and more.

The music group successfully thwarted Yout&#x27;s request for a declaration that its service doesnt circumvent YouTube&#x27;s technological protection measures. This was a futile endeavor from the start, the RIAA argues.

They say that billpayers are liable because they pirated content themselves or failed to stop someone else who did. When movie company Voltage Holdings tried to win default judgments against 30 internet subscribers, none of whom were shown to be the actual infringers, a judge refused to comply. In its appeal, Voltage says the judge made the wrong decision.

                              <span>According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.
Onoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.
Earlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.
The Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a very unpleasant game. Like every Call of Duty game, the majority of time spent playing involves either killing or being killed in horrendous ways, for one thing, and there’s a natural revulsion that comes from seeing so many gouts of blood shooting from bodies or the ragged slump of newly lifeless human corpses piled up in a doorway. And yet, the surface-level hideousness of its parade of death might not be so notably ugly if it wasn&#x27;t for Modern Warfare II&#x27;s cast of c…</span>

                              <span>The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.


In the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.
Knuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.
The past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.</span>

                              <span>Developer Salt &amp; Pixel and publisher VoxPop Games have revealed Outer Terror, a new arcade bullet hell with roguelite elements coming to PC soon. That&#x27;s because its release is set for sometime this year, and given there are only two months left in 2022, it sounds like we won&#x27;t have to wait too long to check it out. 
Outer Terror&#x27;s inspirations are clear from the jump: pulpy horror comics and B-movie horror from the 1980s and 1990s with a dash of arcade fun thrown in for good measure. In the game, you&#x27;ll choose from one of 10 survivors to control, each with their own unique weapons and skills, to face off against waves of enemies. You can play by yourself, but you can also team up with a friend via two-player co-op.

                              <span>Spry Fox, the developer of games like Cozy Grove and Alphabears, is joining Netflix games to become the company’s sixth in-house game studio. The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.
Spry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.
Spry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.
Netflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development. Have you had a chance to play any games on the Netflix app? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>When Electronic Arts&#x27; Motive Studios announced its Iron Man game in September, we learned it would be the first of a multi-game deal between the publisher and Marvel. That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.
EA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. 
It&#x27;s worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. 
“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players&#x27; reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”
We’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake). What heroes would you like to see EA tackle, and which studio do you want to see bring them to life? Let us know in the comments.</span>

This news comes by way of a new interview between Spencer and the Same Brain YouTube channel, where Spencer said Activision Blizzard would keep releasing Call of Duty games on Sony consoles &quot;as long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to,&quot; as reported by Eurogamer. 
&quot;We&#x27;re not taking Call of Duty from PlayStation,&quot; Spencer said. &quot;That&#x27;s not our intent. Our intent is not to do that. As long as there&#x27;s a PlayStation out there to ship to, our intent is that we continue to ship Call of Duty on PlayStation, similar…</span>

This news comes as a surprise considering how devoted Cavill has seemed to the role over the years, quickly becoming a fan-favorite after the release of Season 1. He released a statement explaining that it was time for him to put down the swords and expressing his enthusiasm for Hemsworth&#x27;s casting in the role. 
&quot;My journey as Geralt of Rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas, I will be laying down my medallion and my swords for Season 4,&quot; Cavill&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;In my stead, the fantastic Mr. Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. 
McMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we&#x27;ll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.

What the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. 
Mewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as &quot;By far the strangest project I&#x27;ve ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” 
The game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.</span>

                              <span>With Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right around the corner, The Pokémon Company is releasing a new expansion in its Sword and Shield series. Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.
The Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. 
This expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.

Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!</span>

It includes a look at all the exclusive bonuses PlayStation players get for playing the game on that platform, too, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
If you&#x27;re familiar with PlayStation&#x27;s usual bonuses for Call of Duty players, you likely won&#x27;t be surprised by this year&#x27;s exclusives, but new players will find that it&#x27;s actually quite a lot. Here&#x27;s what PlayStation players are getting:
Battle Pass Bundle Bonus: Unlock new gear and goodies even faster, PlayStation players that purchase a Battle Pass Bundle will get an additional 5 tier skips. That&#x27;s a total of 25 tier skips.
