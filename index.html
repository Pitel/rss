                              <span>Black Friday generally doesn’t involve as many CPU deals as it does, say, SSD deals or gaming keyboard deals – probably because there just aren’t that many CPUs. Nevertheless, a few choice discounts have emerged for an unlikely group of chips: Intel’s 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors. These only released late in October, so it’s a welcome surprise to them on the Black Friday chopping block so soon.

                              <span>During my journey into the depths of TikTok&#x27;s dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that&#x27;s now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It&#x27;s been a strange couple of hours.
Dabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called &quot;dabloons&quot; cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It&#x27;s as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.

                              <span>A tiny bridge makes so much sense as a late-game Vampire Survivors challenge stage. The game&#x27;s arguably at its most captivating when the hordes start clogging up your death machinery, squeezing you into tighter and tighter corridors as you pray for a power-up or multi-item chest. It&#x27;s pleasantly squirmy, but will the bridge added in yesterday&#x27;s appropriately titled &quot;The Tiny One&quot; update be too squirmy? 
The update also added a couple new achievements, and an item that lets you banish a weapon or power-up of your choosing across all of your runs. Come see.

                              <span>Sometimes, my friends, the Internet pulls something out of the ether that truly stumps even the most knowledgeable and informed among us. Case in point: today’s rumblings that Grasshopper Manufacture, the devs behind the No More Heroes series, are working on a AAA game in the Aliens universe. This caught Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s founder and CEO Goichi Suda, aka Suda51, so much by surprise that he wordlessly tweeted his utter bemusement at the rumour. I’m taking that as a no for the Alien game, then.

This change allows whoever is setting up one of the game’s Immortal Empires campaigns in multiplayer to fiddle with the endgame how they please. Devs Creative Assembly have even gone and done one of those video thingies for the update, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Another Black Friday means another opportunity for the Logitech G502 Hero - RPS readers&#x27; most favouritest gaming mouse - to get nice and cheap. This button-rich desk rodent is a particularly common sight during big PC hardware sales like Black Friday, but it&#x27;s hard to tire of seeing when it&#x27;s one of the best gaming mice ever made, and I actually prefer it to the recent G502 X refresh - especially when it&#x27;s 56% off. That&#x27;s precisely 56% off in both the UK and US, too.


Alright, technically it&#x27;s the Logitech G502 Hero SE (Special Edition) that has the best available price in the UK; the standard model is £5 more for some reason. But the only difference between this and the all-black G502 Hero is the addition of some white highlights, so otherwise they share the same comfortable shape, highly customisable 11-button layout, and sharp 25,600dpi sensor.

                              <span>The magic of Yakuza games (now known as Like A Dragon, technically but hey) lies in the dramatic ascents up the Millenium Tower to prevent surprisingly muscular 60-year-old men from detonating Kamurocho. The rain falls. The lads rip their suits off. Then they settle things with their fists, because to do anything otherwise would be silly.
But the real magic of Yakuza lies in its minigames, one of the best being karaoke. And thanks to Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, we now know why their games are obsessed with the beloved singsong.

I’m not sure I could manage not to totally lose it under those circumstances, but survival horror Sorry We’re Closed from devs à la mode and publishers Akupara Games plonks you into the vaguely 32-bit shoes of cool cucumber Michelle to do exactly that. The game takes the familiar fixed camera angles from classics such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone In The Dark, but combat’s being handled in first-person. Have a look for yourself below, and watch out for your third eye.

                              <span>It’s still the frigid morning of Black Friday 2022, but there might already be a superlative gaming laptop deal up for grabs. Here in the UK, Ebuyer has an RTX 3070-equipped version of the MSI Katana GF66 laptop down to just £950 – a saving of £449.


Not only is that a big, meaty chunk of cash to carve off, it’s also an outstandingly low price for a gaming laptop with the RTX 3070 specifically. I’ve seen this high-end GPU in a few other laptops that are up for Black Friday sales, but they’re tending more towards the £1100 mark. In terms of getting the most graphical power for the least money, then, the Katana GF66 is unlikely be beaten today. Even by the RTX 3080 laptop for £1200 deal that&#x27;s still going.

The comment came after reports began circulating that the US Federal Trade Commission could bring a lawsuit against Microsoft over the deal. Anonymous sources claiming to be close to the matter also suggested that a lawsuit from the FTC might begin as early as December.

However, that is slowly changing, with Black Friday Eve bringing a new low price on the high-end CPU: £475, down from a launch RRP of £600. That&#x27;s a tidy £125 discount and a great price for one of the fastest consumer CPUs money can buy.

We&#x27;ve finally been given a date for the next Disney Dreamlight Valley update, and it&#x27;s pretty soon — December 6th!
The game, which is still in early access, has a long way to go before it can be a full release, with all the content required to make it feel busy and lively, plus the promised free-to-play mechanics (whether you want them or not). And, of course, the developers at Gameloft are steadily fixing a lot of bugs, glitches, and other issues that players have been reporting over the past couple of months of early access.

Fall Guys wouldn&#x27;t really be a property of Epic Games unless every IP under the sun was gradually brought to it the form of cosmetic items. On top of Sonic, Star Trek, Alien and the recently-released Doctor Who collections, the studio has now announced that Street Fighter will be the next franchise to get the wobbly treatment.
Shared in a blog post over on the game&#x27;s official site, the team announced that a collection of Street Fighter-themed products would be landing in the Blunderdome store tomorrow. Yep, you will be able to see what it&#x27;s like to take on a wild obstacle course as Ryu, Cammy or Akuma - finally!

The ever expanding multiverse that is the MCU has been no stranger to a Nintendo reference in the past. There was the Wii and GameCube nod in WandaVision, Kamala and her pals playing Smash Bros. in Ms. Marvel and even a little bit of Switch in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. But the latest addition to the franchise - Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special - takes it to a whole new level, showing the joy that some retro Nintendo goodness can bring at Christmas time (thanks, Time Extension).
We won&#x27;t go too deep into the details here for fear of alerting the TVA to our timeline on charges of spoilers, but we will need to do some description of what happens in the scene. So if you really don&#x27;t want to see anything about the Guardians&#x27; latest adventure, maybe skip the following until you have watched it.

While perhaps not quite as polished as it appeared on other platforms, Sifu&#x27;s Switch debut really knew how to deal out the hits when it arrived on the console earlier this month. Fortunately, Sloclap isn&#x27;t pulling any punches with keeping the game up to scratch as it has announced that the Fall Title Update will be coming in December.
Based on the team&#x27;s announcement tweet (which doesn&#x27;t specify any consoles at the moment, so we are assuming the Switch&#x27;s inclusion), it seems that the biggest add-on coming to the game will be the addition of the replay editor. Sifu&#x27;s combat is smooth - real smooth - and this new tool looks to help us with making those clips extra cinematic. Like Park Chan-wook himself on the set of Oldboy, you will be able to follow the hero along corridors with your camera, focusing on certain hits and pulling back on others - cinema!

In case you missed it, CD Projekt Red&#x27;s award-winning video game The Witcher 3 is receiving a &quot;next-gen&quot; update on December 14th.
As part of this, there&#x27;ll also be some Witcher Netflix DLC added to the game - even on the Nintendo Switch. In a new live stream, CDPR has now briefly outlined what players can expect. Instead of just handing over the new themed gear and items to players, there&#x27;ll actually be a &#x27;DLC&#x27; quest for all of this.

The recently launched Pokémon Trading Card Live &quot;limited beta&quot; on computer and mobile devices has made a minor but significant change to digital card codes players receive in physical packs.

                              <span>As of writing, the fastest runthrough of Neon White’s “Smackdown” level is 9.56 seconds, earned by player “earlobe” on September 6, 2022.
Standing in contrast is the work that went into it. According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.
Neon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...</span>

                              <span>The Nintendo Switch has an incredibly strong library of games, with many worth recommending. For our 10 absolute favorite games, however, you can check out the list below. It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                              <span>Despite an avalanche of entries since its original release in 1991, many still consider Sonic the Hedgehog 2 the pinnacle of the series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn&#x27;t faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game&#x27;s success to share how Sonic&#x27;s second outing became one of Sega&#x27;s driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.
Coming off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the compensation after the Navy was shown to have copied and used software without permission. Whether Bitmanagement will celebrate this win is up for question as the damages are less than 0.1% of the $155 million it asked for.

                              <span>This year’s Black Friday season is awash with early deals on gaming monitors, and there’s one I want to highlight before it sells out – which might be imminently, if its stock tracker is accurate. It’s the NZXT Canvas 27Q, which I recently called the best 1440p gaming monitor you can buy. And that was before it felt the force of a 30% Black Friday saving, with £116 sliced off the RRP.

                              <span>Back in the day, I could get lost in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind for days, when I could get it to stop crashing anyway. There’s loads more Morrowind in 2022 than I could’ve imagined as a teenager though, as the Tamriel Rebuilt mod project has been working for decades to add other areas of the Elder Scrolls’ provincial mainland into the game. Their latest release, 22.11, landed this week, adding a huge one-two punch of expansions. You can see some of one of those, Dominions Of Dust, in the trailer below.

But though it be sad, it is an occasion nonetheless, which means Matthew is going out in style as we build the ideal video game character dinner party. Spoilers: there is a giant ant and a boat full of cocaine.
As it&#x27;s his last day, Matthew also does a fiendishly difficult Cavern Of Lies themed around secret endings. Which of us will end up dead and loaded onto the cocaine boat while the others beat a retreat?

There’s no re-using old DDR4 sticks with AMD’s latest and greatest, then, but with this week’s Black Friday deals you could get a brand new DDR5 kit for less.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll have heard by now that Pentiment is bloody good. It&#x27;s a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It&#x27;s inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).
In the ol&#x27; days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren&#x27;t educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You&#x27;ve probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.

                              <span>Like many free-to-play live service games these days, Overwatch 2 loves its skins. Occasionally though, Blizzard stumble with their cosmetic offerings, rather like they’ve tripped over an invisible dog. Players have been taking to Twitter and Reddit to voice their irritation with support hero Moira’s rather uninspired new legendary skin, based on the classic black and white look of mime artists everywhere. Just like mime artists themselves, it’s not very popular.

That’s a £90 saving on the RRP, and the cheapest that this set of wireless cans has ever been in the UK.

                              <span>One No Man’s Sky player has made a standalone app that lets you construct bases by moving, snapping together, and colouring parts ready to slot straight into the game. Technical artist Charlie Banks has popped the base-building app up on NexusMods, and has used it to create a massive robot that looks a little like the Iron Giant squatting down. Banks compares the base-building app’s simplicity to Oskar Stålberg’s procedurally generated hamlet-crafter Townscaper, although it seems a bit more complicated than that game.

                              <span>Upcoming sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol will have 25 death animations locked behind its season pass, but developers Striking Distance Studios have insisted these aren’t being held back for DLC. Striking Distance CEO Glen A. Schofield took to Twitter to try to reassure players that work hadn’t even begun on the animations yet. You can watch The Callisto Protocol’s slightly early launch trailer below.

Yet on the eve of Black Friday 2022, a couple of early deals have presented that most elusive of sights: Nvidia’s best graphics card for 4K, down to a perfectly reasonable £700 / $700.

US newspaper Politico report that three anonymous sources with knowledge of the potential antitrust lawsuit have claimed it could happen in December, although any such lawsuit isn&#x27;t guaranteed. The four FTC commissioners haven’t voted to decide on a complaint yet, and haven’t met with Microsoft or Activision Blizzard lawyers, two of the sources said.

                              <span>The propellers spin down, and I step off the puddle-jumper plane onto the tarmac of the tiniest airport I’ve ever visited. Instantly, I’m overcome by the scent of greenery – lush and humid, with a hint of maybe mint. Jungle surrounds this strip of paved runway in every direction. And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.
But first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale. The team is toying with a big idea: Craft a game that’s rewarding in its own right but simultaneously introduces players of the world to a place most of them have never seen. Read more...</span>

The two discuss the game&#x27;s visual style, how it plays, its similarities to Vampire Survivors, and everything else going on in this exclusive preview. This demo build features a small snippet of one of the game&#x27;s five volumes and our gameplay showcases how the on-screen action works, the horrors from beyond, and how quests work in Outer Terror. 
Check out Outer Terror for yourself below in this installment of New Gameplay Today: 


As you can see, Outer Terror is shaping up to be a great time, perfect for those moments where you&#x27;ve got 10 or 15 minutes to blitz through hordes of the undead, monsters from beyond, and more. For more about Outer Terror and what to expect from the game, check out our coverage of the game from last month. 
Outer Terror hits PC via Steam and the VoxPop Games Store (with exclusive content on that storefront, too), but a release date has not yet been revealed.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet sold more than 10 million combined units over its launch weekend, claiming the top spot for most three-day launch weekend software sales in Nintendo&#x27;s history. The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury.
The current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.</span>

                              <span>Fighting aliens in video games have been an important part of the medium since its inception. The very first video game, Space War, was about a war in space. Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.
The smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games. When we fight aliens, it’s usually a power trip meant to offer a playground of action possibilities, but …</span>

                              <span>UK police are reporting the arrest of a 43-year-old man as part of a &quot;large-scale&quot; TV piracy investigation. Officers from Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit teamed up with South Yorkshire Police to execute warrants on Tuesday. The arrest arrives in the wake of stronger-than-usual rumors that police were preparing to hit pirate IPTV entities during the World Cup.

                              <span>Putlocker is a familiar name among piracy watchers. The original platform&#x27;s .com domain was retired many years ago after its operators felt Hollywood breathing down their necks. That doesn&#x27;t mean their old domain is worthless though. The Putlocker brand remains popular and just recently the putlocker.com domain sold at auction for more than $100k.

If you celebrate it, happy Thanksgiving! If not, there&#x27;s a few games to potentially pick up.
The marquee on for this small-ish week is The Knight Witch, which is due out on November 29 on the Switch eshop (also on Steam). It&#x27;s a promising looking Metroidvania, with a few interesting concepts (like accessibility/mechanical toggles) and a spell system that also promises shmup gameplay.
That&#x27;s pretty much it in terms of this week. Things will start picking up a little more as we head into the holiday season, and things quiet down in mid-December or so.

SNK has offered up more information pertaining to the second season of its excellent team-scrapper The King of Fighters XV — From January 2023, new characters, modes, and under-the-hood tech tweaks will begin a steady rollout across all platforms, bringing further excitement to one of the long-running franchise&#x27;s best-ever entries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;kCsTzOoWZZ0
Season 2 starts with the dawning of the new year, bringing with it a brand new character balance update and the first DLC fighter of season 2: Kyo Kusanagi fanboy and good-hearted goof Shingo Yabuki. As winter turns to spring, the taekwondo master and bringer of JUSTICE, Kim Kaphwan, will make his eagerly awaited return to the ring. Evildoers beware.
In addition, spring will see SNK launch an open beta test for its new crossplay functionality, allowing fighters to test their mettle across PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, and Epic Games Store platforms. Across the remainder of the year, fans can expect more characters and balance patches. This will hopefully keep fan fervor up for what has been a successful first year for The King of Fighters — easily the most relevant that a KoF title has been on the global FGC stage in many years.

                              <span>Season’s greetings from Destructoid’s least-American writer
It&#x27;s that time of year again! And as the Destructoid office closes for a much-earned weekend of merriment, it is once again up to yer boy Moyse to celebrate a holiday that has absolutely nothing to do with him. That&#x27;s fine, because I like spending the holidays with you. Besides, you&#x27;re never alone if you have a talking Dusa plush from Fangamer. Anywhoo, &#x27;tis Thanksgiving, or Friendsgiving, or Turkey Day, or even Turkee Day (for my vegan pals). Whatever you call it, it amounts to good food, a weirdly aggressive bout of Black Friday capitalism, and a much-needed break from the ol&#x27; nine-to-five.
It can be tough to find thanks lately, after all, we are still somewhat mired in a relatively unhappy global situation. It has been this way…</span>

                              <span>Cult fighter to receive major upgrade
SNK&#x27;s fab and precise fighting title Samurai Shodown is currently preparing to make a comeback, bolstered by the power of some slick new rollback netcode. The developer announced that it will hold an open beta in January 2023 to test the sword-slashing title&#x27;s new functionality.
The beta test will be held on the Steam edition of Samurai Shodown. It will offer SNK the opportunity to fine-tune the stability of the fighter&#x27;s online mechanics ahead of the official rollback rollout, currently scheduled for spring 2023. Rollback netcode will be applied to the PlayStation, PC, and Xbox ports of Samurai Shodown, though the Nintendo Switch and (inevitably) Stadia releases will be missing out.
The arrival of rollback netcode, albeit three years late, will be very welcome to SamSho&#x27;s devoted community. The 2019 reboot is unique among its fighting brethren, both in its visual design and its playstyle, and as such it deserves a new lease of life. Here&#x27;s hoping that the update will help bring back some of those wandering ronins to a game that, frankly, deserves a better reputation within the fighting game community.
Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

CD Projekt Red showcased the upcoming next-gen update for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt today, and it looks pretty great. From big updates to small little changes, it seems like a really good excuse to dive back into this massive RPG.
The special REDstreams showcase aired today, going over the details of what&#x27;s to come for the update. While it&#x27;s a next-gen boost for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, PC owners will also be able to take advantage of the tune-ups too. To start, here&#x27;s a trailer:

On the graphics side of things, consoles will get the option for a performance or graphics mode. Performance will target 60 FPS, while the graphics will aim for 30 FPS with ray tracing.

                              <span>A fresh look at what Dead Island 2 has been up to
Dead Island 2 is rising from the beyond to share more of what the team&#x27;s been working on. A new Dead Island 2 showcase is scheduled for Tuesday, December 6.
The stream will kick off at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET, with the Dead Island 2 showcase airing on the Dead Island YouTube channel. You can find that link here.

What&#x27;s the team planning to showcase? Well, so far we just have a description of &quot;action, gore, and zombies.&quot; Hopefully we get to see some details of what&#x27;s in store for the long-in-development sequel to Dead Island.
Rising from the grave
It&#x27;s at least another sign of life from the Dead Island 2 project, which has been in the works for quite a long time at this point. We did get confirmation of a release date and details at Gamescom earlier this year, but publisher Deep Silver confirmed last week that it&#x27;s been pushed from February out to April 28, 2023.
“The irony of delaying Dead Island 2 is not lost on us, and we are as disappointed as you undoubtedly are,” reads a statement from Deep Silver on the delay. “The delay is just 12 short weeks and development is on the final straight now; we’re going to take the time we need to make sure we can launch a game we’re proud to launch. For those of you who’ve been waiting for years, thank you for hanging in there with us.”
More delays tacked onto Dead Island 2 is one thing. But players also probably want to know what the game looks like after so many years. The zombie-smashing, weapon-crafting action of Dead Island could be pretty fun to play again. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting it onto platforms and out of the lab.
We&#x27;ll see if the showcase delivers on December 6.

The Wii U had a pretty dull launch line-up, all told. There, we said it. Between the likes of New Super Mario Bros. U, ZombiU, and Mass Effect 3, there was a general consensus that while all of these games are undoubtedly good, they didn&#x27;t exactly set the world on fire and justify the Wii U as a &quot;must-have&quot; console.

The Wii is now 16 years old. That might be enough to set you off on a certain existential crisis, true, but we can all take comfort in the fact that people are still discovering new things that the console is capable of. Take Pierre Dandumont for example, who has finally managed to answer the age-old question - could you get a Wii to run Mac OS? The answer is yes. Just about (thanks, Gizmodo).
Shared in a video on his YouTube channel, the tech wiz demonstrates not only that the Wii is capable of getting the Apple operating system up and running, but it can even open up some applications! Internet Explorer 5? No problems (bar the absence of an internet connection). iTunes? Light work (so long as you don&#x27;t want to hear any music). A quick game of Doom? Easy peasy - actually running at one frame per minute, we can&#x27;t say this is either &#x27;quick&#x27; or a &#x27;game&#x27;, but the project is impressive nonetheless.

Though he retired from Nintendo in 2021, Takaya Imamura has been behind some of the company&#x27;s most iconic characters. Working on titles including F-Zero, Star Fox, The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask and many more, you could say that he is something of a wiz with the pen (understatement of the year), and now Imamura has turned his talents to manga (thanks, Manga-News).
A slight departure from the world of video games, Imamura&#x27;s debut manga, Omega 6, is now available to buy from publishers Omaké Books for €7.90 (around £8).

There are 107 new Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet, including all new evolutions, forms, and legendaries — and we&#x27;re here today to pick the very best of them.
Our writers (the ones playing Pokémon, anyway) have sat down to decide their favourite Pokémon designs out of those 107 — and even though our picks are sometimes determined by competitive suitability and sometimes just by sheer cuteness, we hope you&#x27;ll agree with us. Here&#x27;s what we went with!

                              <span>A neat update.
There is a lot of new content that will be heading to Splatoon 3 next week with the arrival of Chill Season 2022. New stages, game modes, weapons and cosmetic items have obviously taken up the majority of our talk so far, but what about the things for those who like to keep things tidy out there? Fortunately, Nintendo is keeping you all in mind and will enable you to fold your clothes for locker displays!
The changes coming to locker storage were announced via the game&#x27;s Japanese Twitter account (@SplatoonJP), confirming that of the many new items with which you will soon be able to decorate your lockers, a neat little pile of t-shirts could be one of them - they can also be leaned, hung or otherwise displayed, whatever takes your fancy.

Fire Emblem Engage is set to come to Switch on 23rd January, 2023, bringing the series to the new world of Elyos. As we have come to expect from the franchise, Engage will introduce us to a new team of heroes but, as confirmed by Nintendo, there are also set to be cameos from few recognisable faces of entries past.
Summoned via magical rings, these legacy heroes — &#x27;Emblems&#x27; — will be able to be called upon in battle to bolster your strength or to use their abilities alongside your own.

We think it&#x27;s fair to say that the huge dust cloud which followed Sonic Frontiers&#x27; launch has finally settled. Clocking in mixed reviews across the board, one topic that seemed to divide us all was the game&#x27;s approach to the &#x27;open zone&#x27; concept with some believing that it was a great leap forward for the Sonic franchise and others seeing it as not going far enough. It seems, however, that these zones were originally intended to be a lot more, well, open.
One fan has been poking about in the Switch&#x27;s game files and has uncovered original beta islands which seem to combine the layout which would be later used in Frontiers&#x27; smaller zones. Posting their discoveries on the YouTube channel ĐeäTh, this tour around Sonic&#x27;s original island presents a world which is far more open than that which we ended up receiving.

We have the latest Japanese Charts data and, as expected, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have absolutely demolished the competition, selling an astonishing 2,537,292 units in the duos first week of sale. This milestone was more than enough to knock Splatoon 3 off the top spot, but Nintendo&#x27;s shooter still pulled in some respectable numbers, selling a total of 36,958 units to bring its total up to 3,368,155.
Elsewhere, Sonic Frontiers has dropped down to number 10 with a total of 5,837 units sold. Having said that, the Switch version is still proving to be the most popular with consumers, with the PS5 and PS4 versions falling out the top ten entrely.

2023 is on the horizon, which, as it turns out, is an entirely different year to 2022, so naturally we&#x27;ve got a brand new Just Dance game to review. Yep, it&#x27;s time for the annual update to Ubisoft&#x27;s long-running franchise and, although it&#x27;s tempting to simply cut-and-paste last year&#x27;s review in here — these games really don&#x27;t change much beyond the playlist from version to version — it turns out there&#x27;s actually been a few meaningful changes made this time around.
First things first, and the best bit of news for us personally, is that you can now turn off the constant notifications and adverts for the Just Dance+ subscription service. If you remember Just Dance 2022, this was one of the most frustrating aspects of last year&#x27;s effort, with constant reminders that you didn&#x27;t have all the content on offer, even though you&#x27;d just forked out fifty quid for the game (which, incidentally, isn&#x27;t getting a physical release this year — beware of those codes-in-boxes!). It&#x27;s great to see Ubisoft recognise that people probably don&#x27;t want to be pushed to spend more cash every time they tune in for a quick bop or workout.

Nejnovější čísla ukazují na hlubokou krizi v celém trhu s počítači, přičemž nejhůře je na tom firma AMD. Letošní třetí kvartál, zahrnující období od července do září, byl mimořádný, protože praskla kryptoměnová bublina a uživatelé zároveň čekali na vydání nové generace karet.</span>

                              <span>Age Of Empires 4 is the first RTS I&#x27;ve taken seriously. I&#x27;ve practised build orders, memorised specific civ counters, watched pro matches and agonised over key bindings. I have gone down into the nitty gritty of sheep micro, just to shear off microseconds from early villager gathering times, but I&#x27;ve never seen a good reason to build half of the landmarks in the game. It&#x27;s a blessed relief, therefore, to see &quot;landmark improvements&quot; on the roadmap for Season 4, alongside a new mode and a funky purple-looking biome.

You can&#x27;t shoot railguns in the swedish wilderness back in WW1, can you now.

                              <span>We just got our first look at The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&#x27;s much-delayed free &quot;next gen&quot; update, by which they mean current gen, and which yep, looks like a looker. Vanilla Witcher 3 still looks gorgeous for a nearly seven year old game, but the upcoming update will add ray-tracing options, ultra+ settings and a suite of other visual and quality of life updates. 
It&#x27;s not out &#x27;til December 14th, but you can peek at it below while the devs natter in the background.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good romcom. As soon as the fateful meet cute happens, you&#x27;ll find me curled up with a blanket swooning over the blossoming romance. Bumping into someone while getting on the train or getting in an elevator might be a minor part of your day, but for a romcom protagonist, it ignites the love story they&#x27;ve been waiting for. They were ready to fall in love and probably hoped for a meet cute because they wanted a surprising story that they could tell everyone about. Like a good romcom, State of Decay 2 often has ways to generate unexpected stories that we&#x27;re secretly hoping will happen. Let&#x27;s call it a meat cute.

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is a game where you control a little pixellated person who auto-attacks periodically. Your aim is to survive for as long as possible as hordes of slime and bats close in around you, and it&#x27;s an excellent time. So excellent, in fact, that it&#x27;s already seen a few spin-offs.
And having sampled a couple of Vampire Survivor-likes, it&#x27;s made me appreciative of the game&#x27;s visual clarity. Yes, things can get messy, but at least you&#x27;re able to make out what&#x27;s happening on screen. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something the subgenre has quite grasped yet.

                              <span>Sometimes you just gotta play the hits, which Amazon are very much doing with their early Black Friday keyboard deals. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless is an enduringly comfortable, responsive, and strikingly slim gaming keyboard that’s a regular feature of sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day, and once again it’s on sale now – both in the UK and in the US.
This time, it’s also being joined by its tenkeyless little brother, the G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless. This shares the same finely-crafted, all-mechanical build and solid wireless connectivity of the full-size model, merely cutting the number pad in pursuit of a smaller desk footprint and a lower price.

                              <span>Not content with your telly or your tablet, Netflix has begun making moves on your PC. The streaming giant is recruiting people to work on “a brand-new AAA PC game”, seeking those with knowledge of Unreal Engine and “experience with FPS and/or third person shooter games”. The ad for their lead engineer specifically refers to the game as a third-person action RPG. 

The new hires will join former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, team lead at the newly formed Netflix Games Studio. Who knows if they&#x27;ll make anything good, but at least it&#x27;ll probably come free with your &#x27;flix.

                              <span>Fantasy doesn’t really do guns very often, preferring to stick to the ol’ sharp pointy metal things that don’t fire bullets instead. I do enjoy when the odd boomstick appears in magical realms though, so I’ve got one eye trained on tactical CRPG Dark Envoy. Putting you in the gunpowder-loving shoes of a refugee adventurer exploring the fantasy world of Jäan while total war rages, you can also bring a pal along in a similar way to Divinity: Original Sin’s campaign co-op. Watch a little of Dark Envoy’s isometric steampunk world in action in the trailer below.

Given that hexes aren&#x27;t going anywhere and dynamic music is scarce, sure, let&#x27;s celebrate dynamic music and hope for more. This week, I ask you to decide between two very different types of attack. What&#x27;s better: overwatch reaction attacks (not Overwatch the game, okay), or the ridiculous gunfire overload that is dakka?

                              <span>I had to check this particular Black Friday deal three times to make sure the specs were right, but yes, you can indeed get an RTX 3080-equipped version of the Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop for £1200. That’s hundreds upon hundreds of pounds less than the average RTX 3080 laptop, even during the current season of early Black Friday offers. 


Until Nvidia get around to making a mobile version of the RTX 4080, this is the second-most powerful RTX laptop GPU you can get, so it’s much more commonly found inside £2000-plus models. Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed. And it’s not like the other components are guff: the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is a perfectly adequate octa-core CPU, and the Nitro 5 ignores slow mechanical storage to equip itself with a 1TB SSD.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life&#x27;s calling. My eyesight&#x27;s terrible, for one, and I guarantee I&#x27;d be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d even make it through the doors at NASA. They&#x27;d take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game&#x27;s story.
There&#x27;s a good reason for this, though, and it&#x27;s one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she&#x27;s anything but. In fact, when she&#x27;s climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home&#x27;s little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game&#x27;s gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It&#x27;s a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers.

                              <span>Not long ago I watched my Warzone Legacy, a two-minute-long compilation of my best stats from the first game, which included my K/D ratio and hours played and the like. It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.
My history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it&#x27;ll last in the long run and confirms that there&#x27;s still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.

In the latter half alone we’ve seen the top-class PCIe 3.0 speeds of the Crucial P3, the surprising affordability of the PCIe 4.0-based Crucial P3 Plus, the outstanding premium-tier performance of the WD Black SN850X, and now the Samsung 990 Pro: an NVMe SSD with the fastest read speeds in the land. So say its makers, anyway.

The big deal with this update is the arrival of Collector Tokens that’ll let you snap up cards you want from the new store. Given the name, it’s not surprising to hear that some fresh, cosmic-themed rare cards are set to land too, including the Silver Surfer and his absolute unit of a mate, Galactus. Watch the dev update video below for more of ever enthusiastic developer Ben Brode talking about what’s coming in the Power Cosmic update.

That would be double what GTA Online players managed during the last Heists Challenge two years ago, when the target was set at the much lower amount of $100 billion. Rockstar are promising a “special reward” later this year if the community hits that $2 trillion total in stolen cash. Buy out Twitter in time for Christmas, maybe?

I’ll be upfront here; I like Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. They move the series forward in several important ways, and there are moments here that are the highest highs of the franchise’s history. Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet are also ridiculously buggy. The performance issues are so rampant that they will impact your experience, regardless of your tolerance for low framerates. This is unacceptable for the largest multimedia franchise on the planet.
But you know what? I&#x27;ve had some hearty laughs encountering glitches in this game. There are so many weird, unpredictable oddities in Scarlet &amp; Violet that I almost look forward to discovering them. In a perfect world, Game Freak would have intentionally made Pokemon do weird stuff in the background just for the player’s amusement. …</span>

                              <span>No need to tack on some more tales just yet
Ragnarok has come and gone for the God of War series. And it sounds like Sony Santa Monica Studio is letting the latest Kratos and Atreus adventure stand alone for now, as God of War Ragnarok DLC seems unlikely.
In a spoilercast about God of War Ragnarok over at Kinda Funny Games (thanks for the spot, Eurogamer), director Eric Williams guested to discuss his game. At one point, he&#x27;s asked about whether DLC is on the way for God of War Ragnarok.
&quot;I don&#x27;t know man, that game is big,&quot; said Williams. &quot;I think we put everything we had into it, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on it.&quot;
While there are updates in store for God of War Ragnarok, adding features like the photo mode, the stance on significant additions isn&#x27;t too surprising. God of War (2018) didn&#x27;t receive any extra DLC.

Patience, boy
I haven&#x27;t rolled credits on Ragnarok yet myself, but my understanding is that it&#x27;s a fairly conclusive story. The sequel is the conclusion to the Norse duology that Sony Santa Monica Studio has created, so I&#x27;d be surprised to see any lingering threads addressed in a DLC update.
Ragnarok is doing well in sales and reception too. And apparently Santa Monica Studio has other things on their plate to take care of, moving forward.
What could those projects be? Well, in the Kinda Funny spoilercast, Williams does mention he&#x27;d love to make a Castlevania game. It&#x27;d be a sight to see if that collaboration ever does work out.

                              <span>Running with the pack
NetEase Games has made a &quot;strategic investment&quot; in the up-and-coming Polish studio Rebel Wolves. The Chinese holding company acquired a minority stake in the new developer, which was founded earlier this year by former members of The Witcher studio CD Projekt RED.
&quot;We’re delighted to welcome NetEase Games as our new shareholder and partner,” said Rebel Wolves CEO Konrad Tomaszkiewicz in a press statement. &quot;Having one of the leading global game companies get behind our vision is a great confidence boost and validation for the entire team at Rebel Wolves. Funding provided by NetEase was the last missing piece needed to go full throttle. With resources available to build a world-class AAA game, we can now focus on what matters most: development.&quot;
This &quot;world-class AAA game&quot; is the first project undertaken by the new studio and, in keeping with its team&#x27;s strengths, is expected to be a dark, open-world RPG with an emphasis on character relationships and far-reaching player consequences. There is currently no solid information on the title&#x27;s release date or platforms but, given the pedigree of CDPR, we can likely expect a pretty long wait ahead.
NetEase Games continues to spread its reach across global gaming development. While the studio had something of a falling out with Activision Blizzard this month, it also opened its first U.S.-based studio this year, Jackalope Games in Austin, Texas. NetEase also has minority and majority shares in partnerships with Quantic Dream, Grasshopper Manufacture, and Nagoshi Studio, led by Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.
Despite the NetEase investment, Rebel Wolves will remain independently operated, maintaining full creative control over its projects as well as full ownership of its IPs and brands.

                              <span>Overdone.
The long-running legal case regarding controversial Cooking Mama: Cookstar has finally drawn to its conclusion, with The International Court of Arbitration ruling that publisher Planet Entertainment did indeed infringe upon Office Create&#x27;s IP with the 2020 release.
Available for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Cooking Mama: Cookstar fell into controversy immediately, with rumors swirling that it utilized the Nintendo Switch hardware to mine cryptocurrency. Though Planet Entertainment stated that this wasn&#x27;t the case, Cooking Mama IP owner Office Create filed suit against the publisher, stating that the company&#x27;s right to use the Cooking Mama brand had expired — the initial build of the comical cook sim having been submitted and rejected back in 2018.
&quot;Unfortunately, the quality of the game builds failed to meet the standards that our customers expect and deserve,&quot; said Office Create at the time. &quot;Office Create rejected a wide range of deficiencies affecting the overall feel, quality, and content of the game.
&quot;Yet, despite being contractually obligated to correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the corrected game for Office Create&#x27;s approval, Planet proceeded to release Cooking Mama: Cookstar without addressing all of the rejections and without Office Create&#x27;s approval.&quot;
Following this week&#x27;s legal ruling, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has been removed from the PSN Store and the Nintendo eShop, and all remaining physical copies must be removed from store shelves. To date, the most recent official Cooking Mama release was Apple Arcade title Cooking Mama: Cuisine! which launched in July of this year.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asking for years, bring it on
In 2012, Nintendo released Kid Icarus: Uprising to the masses, and I was enamored. I couldn&#x27;t put that game down for hours at a time, and amid some odd 3DS controls (that I did get used to!): it was one of my favorite games of that year, and that entire era. It was bubbling with more personality than the vast majority of games released even still, and it was like watching a cartoon in game form. 10 years later, Masahiro Sakurai is ready for it to make a return. 11 years ago, I was too!
In his latest game creation/development class video, Sakurai muses on difficulty: specifically, how Kid Icarus approached the concept with &quot;the fiend&#x27;s cauldron.&quot; In case you skipped over Uprising entirely (which is extremely likely!), the gist is that players can set …</span>

                              <span>End of line for Onoma
Square Enix Montreal, which recently changed its name to Onoma, has announced that it is to shut down service for four of its mobile titles. The quartet of games will officially end service on January 4, 2023, ahead of the studio&#x27;s announced closure.
Hitman Sniper: The Shadows; Deus EX GO; Arena Battle Champions; and Space Invaders: Hidden Heroes will be removed from the iOS App Store and the Android Store on December 1. Additionally, all in-game purchases have been suspended. On January 4, all four titles will be rendered unplayable. No refunds will be issued for the initial game purchase or any DLC downloads.

Square Enix Montreal, founded back in 2011, was mostly focused on the creation of mobile and free-to-play titles, finding a small but dedicated audience with its GO strategy series, which utilized famous IPs such as Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex. The studio was picked up earlier this year as part of a transaction that saw holding company Embracer Group acquire much of Square Enix&#x27; western subsidiaries, including studios Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, along with their respective IPs.
Soon after, it was announced that Square Enix Montreal was rebranding as Onoma, which appeared to signal a new lease of life for the company. However, in a shocking turn of events, the studio&#x27;s closure was announced mere weeks later.

While everybody, from developer to media to players, was expecting Sony Santa Monica&#x27;s epic sequel God of War Ragnarok to light up the cash registers with the fury of Helios, perhaps nobody was quite expecting it to immediately become the fastest-selling launch in PlayStation&#x27;s entire history, as decreed by the industry giant itself.
Over the course of its debut week, God of War Ragnarok shifted a staggering 5.1 million combined physical and digital copies, not only breaking launch records for the long-running mythological franchise, but also beating launch records for every single first-party game in PlayStation history, dating right back to the brand&#x27;s debut in 1994. That&#x27;s a meaty feat.
God of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.  And it seems folks are into it.

An an interesting move, Bethesda has revealed the theme for season 11 of Fallout 76: and it&#x27;s going to fold over into the upcoming December 6 expansion. Yep, it&#x27;s none other than Nuka-World, complete with a season map that depicts the theme park before the post-apocalyptic setting of the series.
Like past seasons (wow, has there really been 11 at this point?), Nuka-World will offer &quot;cosmetics, CAMP items, atoms, caps, and more&quot; as you progress through the track. There&#x27;s a short trailer you can watch below that shows off the season offerings/rewards, as well as some of the expansion itself.
As a reminder, the ammo box is also coming, but only if you pay up for the game&#x27;s subscription service: &quot;Active Fallout 1st members can also unlock exclusive rewards and special S.C.O.R.E. boosts throughout the Season, but there’s more! This update also grants an all-new feature for Fallout 1st members at no additional charge: the Ammo Box! Keep unlimited numbers of your bullets, shells and such in safekeeping, like the existing Scrap Box currently available to Fallout 1st members. Note that the Ammo Box is for stackable ammo types only and won’t store Fusion Cores or Plasma Cores.&quot;
In addition to a few other &quot;holiday games,&quot; I&#x27;m thinking I might hunker down and play through this expansion when things get slower in mid-December: the game is in a decent place to recruit friends into, especially with Game Pass.

With the arrival of a new Guilty Gear Strive combatant, we see the return of Arc System Works&#x27; super-handy Starter Guide series, giving us the ins and outs of the new fighter in order to get players up and running — And this time around, it is the turn of ass-kicking offspring Sin Kiske!
Sin Kiske, as his name denotes, is the son of Guilty Gear&#x27;s regal poster boy Ky Kiske, his mother being the ethereal Half-Gear, Dizzy. As such, Sin has inherited her Gear blood, bolstering the fighting abilities handed down by his father. As a relatively young man of great spirit, Sin is far more happy-go-lucky than his parents, boasting a somewhat cocky attitude and untamed personality. But his heart is just and true, and he remains a stalwart defender of the good and righteous, operat…</span>

Last night saw the arguable start of awards season, with the return of the annual Golden Joystick Awards, an institution that has now run for some four decades. Presented by GamesRadar, the 2022 edition of the veteran UK ceremony saw almost three million votes cast by the gaming public, hoping to shine a spotlight on the many titles that have entertained them over the past 12 months.
And, in what may prove to be something of a portent for things to come, Bandai Namco&#x27;s challenging fantasy adventure Elden Ring was the big winner on the night, walking away with five awards in total including Ultimate Game of the Year and the Critic&#x27;s Choice award, (as well as, curiously, Best Multiplayer). Devolver Digital&#x27;s Cult of the Lamb took home the Best Indie Game gong…</span>

[Update: In a new statement to VGC, Team Ninja&#x27;s Tom Lee has suggested that fans shouldn&#x27;t hold their breath on these previously hinted reboots for both Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive.
&quot;Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden are both long-standing pillar franchises for Team Ninja. These celebrated titles are synonymous with our studio history and reputation,&quot; said Lee in VGC&#x27;s statement. &quot;It goes without saying that when speaking about the development of our past and future projects, both of these important titles cannot be left without mention. However, there are no details or information to share on either of these franchises at this present time.&quot;

However, even those returning fighters have some changes to their looks, outfits, and personalities for this sixth mainline entry.
During our trip to Osaka, Japan, where we visited Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, we sat down with Street Fighter 6 art director Kaname Fujioka to learn more about his time at Capcom. &quot;The biggest inspiration for me wanting to join Capcom and work on fighting games was Street Fighter II,&quot; he says. &quot;I w…</span>

                              <span>A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon &quot;Emblems,&quot; characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.


Units can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.
In total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.
Fire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.</span>

                              <span>As the holiday season approaches, millions of us will inevitably be stuck inside with our family members looking for the right games to play. Multiplayer is a must, but something competitive might not be the way to go – there are only so many games of Mario Party and Monopoly a group of people can play together before they want to rip each others&#x27; heads off.
In this case, co-op is the way to go: specifically, something everyone can play in the same room on the same TV. But with so many games out there, how do you separate a perfect holiday gift from a dastardly holiday grift? Fret not! We&#x27;ve compiled a list of some of the best games to turn that seasonal boredom into wintertime wonderment. Here&#x27;s a collection of couch co-op games that&#x27;ll get you crowned as the coolest cousin of the year.

Interestingly, DaftSex.com was recently seized by MindGeek so is not a pirate site.

                              <span>Valve have been awarded a patent for a new virtual reality motion controller. It looks a lot like the Meta Quest controllers, with a ring design at its top rather than the flat face of the previous Valve Index motion controllers. Its inclusion could be a further suggestion that Valve&#x27;s next headset will be standalone, without the need to be plugged into a PC.

                              <span>Colony sim RimWorld added ideologies in an expansion last year, prompting Nate to force drifters to knife-fight a unicorn (among other things). There have been other RimWorld expansions however, and while each has added a substantial new chunk of content, those systems have previously been unable to interact with each other.

That changed with RimWorld 1.4, which adds &quot;cross-expansion integration&quot;, so now you can use the ideology system from the Ideology expansion to, for example, tell stories about people who have ideologies about the biotech from the biotech expansion.

                              <span>Here’s an early Black Friday deal for anyone still prodding at a mushy membrane keyboard: in the UK, you can get the all-mechanical Cooler Master SK652 for just £45. If you go for the black model, that’s a £65 saving off the RRP, and it’s £95 off if you opt for the white version, which is £45 as well.
£45! And it&#x27;s full-size to boot. There are always nice savings to be had among Black Friday’s gaming keyboard deals, but even then, the only way you’d normally see a mech board this cheap was if it was secondhand. And had keycaps missing. And was haunted, possibly by some kind of dismembered hand ghost.

Set in a post-apocalypse with no women, you play as Brad who one day finds an abandoned baby girl, names her Buddy, and raises her in secret. Years later, Buddy is kidnapped by a militia group and Brad sets off to rescue her. When you put it like that, the story is pretty basic, but it’s so much more than it seems. The absurdist comical world together with the awful decisions forced upon you make this a special kind of bleak RPG.

Which is basically what this place was.&quot; His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich&#x27;s father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (&quot;As a result I&#x27;m hugely into shuffleboard&quot;, Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.
Back in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they&#x27;d put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn&#x27;t matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park&#x27;s massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. &quot;The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,&quot; Popovich says.

                              <span>While XCOM is about as serious as I get with turn-based tactics, I have been curious to try more, so I decided to give Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector a go after seeing it&#x27;s leaving Game Pass soon. Brothers, it&#x27;s decent. Familiarity with the rock-paper-chainsword setup of Warhammer 40K arsenals is easing me into the unfamiliar world of retreating attacks and armour calculations. If you&#x27;re in a similar position and also on Game Pass, maybe have a look before it leaves Microsoft&#x27;s subscription service at the end of the month.

                              <span>I’m always looking for new games to play with my kids, and MegaWobble’s Lil Gator Game seems like just the right combination of harmless and wacky for us. Coming to Steam on December 14th, Lil Gator Game involves most of the core components of childhood, such as displays of reckless acrobatics, pretending sticks are swords, and making friends with every other random child you meet. You can see what I mean by watching the trailer below.

The WD Black SN850X is the overall second-fastest NVMe SSD in the RPS benchmark books – with the outright fastest write speeds – and its 1TB model has some sizeable savings going for it, across both the UK and US.

                              <span>I’ve been playing Pokémon Violet over the past few days, and fortunately I haven’t suffered many of the glaring tech issues that have gone viral since launch. There are fairly frequent frame drops and a few camera glitches, but nothing that’s ruined my experience just yet. What has caught my eye, though, is simply how small some of the Pokémon are in Paldea. They’re tiny little things, and the onslaught of oddly small critters reminds me that sometimes, size really does matter.

Dubbed Babataire EX – nice – the game bases its suits on four of the endearing little creatures from Baba Is You. There’s good ol’ Baba, of course, joined by Keke, Fofo and Jiji. Hempuli only seems to have begun the project earlier this month, but you can already have a go for free on itch.io. If you do, then I hope you have better luck than I did understanding what exactly is going on.

One thing I hadn’t thought of it as, at least until now, was a dance simulator, but then I’ve never used Tiktok. A cunning Warzone 2 player has managed to convince the enemy team to abandon their hostilities and indulge in a spot of shuffling to DJ Casper’s classic turn of the millennium hit Cha Cha Slide. It’s an odd choice, particularly considering they’re jumping around in a cemetery, but each to their own.

It&#x27;s no secret that for a long while, my friends and I were smitten with its PS1-era graphics, snappy building, and heady mixture of relaxation and sense of dread. Our odyssey was one of carrots and boars, half-naked sails and bees.
So, count me excited when Liam and I had the chance to sample Valheim&#x27;s next major update Mistlands, which brings with it a smoky new biome, magic, new building bits, and blimps that are actually giant ticks that soar in the sky and spit acidic warheads at you. It was great to be back.

It&#x27;s called Duty Eternal, which I seriously considered trying to cram into the headline for a moment there, but swiftly realised I&#x27;d barely have room for anything else other than maybe an &quot;is&quot; and a &quot;get&quot; before we ran over three lines, so here we are. Launching on December 6th for £13 / $15, the Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters: Duty Eternal expansion (told you it was a big&#x27;un) will add the enormous Venerable Dreadnought combat mech to the game, as well as a new class, new missions and a bunch of other &quot;substantial changes&quot;, according to the devs. Have a peek of the all-new reveal trailer (and that giant mech) below.

                              <span>The developers of Marvel’s Avengers have removed the game’s design lead Brian Waggoner as a spokesperson after offensive tweets were brought to light. Waggoner had posted a racist comment on the social media platform in 2014, and an ableist one in 2010. Members of the Marvel’s Avengers community have uncovered and shared other examples of Waggoner’s behaviour online from before he joined Crystal Dynamics.

                              <span>I’m rounding up Steam Deck-ready microSD sales over in our best early Black Friday SSD deals hub, but thought it worth highlighting the Samsung Pro Plus more directly. This is, of all the ones I’ve tried, the best microSD card for Valve’s handheld PC, and it’s currently enjoying some discounts in both the UK and US.


These focus on the 256GB and 512GB models, the latter being the roomiest capacity that the Pro Plus comes in. Assuming that you do indeed find yourself constrained by your Deck’s own SSD, I’d suggest aiming for 512GB if you can – 256GB  will hold a fair few games but might also fill up fast if you’re installing a lot of gigabyte-hogging AAA games. Then again, an extra 256GB might be fine otherwise – many of the best Steam Deck games, like Vampire Survivors, have a tiny installation footprint. Your call.

We were so busy putting together The RPS 100 last month (including the first ever Reader Edition), that we clean ran out of time to do another RPS Time Capsule. But fear not! Our written repository of games we&#x27;ve deemed worthy of saving from the eternal hell bin of the future has returned, and this time it&#x27;s a good &#x27;un. The year is 2015, folks, and cor, has there ever been a better year for video games? Of course, with only 11 slots to fill in our RPS Time Capsule, it also means we&#x27;re having to say goodbye to some real gems. Come and see what&#x27;s transcended to the higher plane of Capsule existence.

                              <span>Several Ubisoft games are heading to Steam, signalling a return to Valve’s storefront for the publisher. In a statement to Eurogamer, Ubisoft confirmed that their open-world history ‘em up Assassin’s Creed Valhalla would be arriving on Steam on December 6th. It’ll be followed by other games from the publisher, although only RTS Anno 1800 and free to play skater Roller Champions have been touted so far.

                              <span>RPS supporters, who are very generous and probably smell fantastic, might recall a post last week in which I gushed about an Electriq eiQ-32M4K144FS that I’d bought secondhand. What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.


This is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel.

                              <span>Ezio Auditore, the fire of Firenze, pulls the guard close in passionate embrace. It’s an intimacy born not of love but its close cousin, hate. Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve got a friend in me (in a few weeks)
The next update to the mouse-powered isekai Disney Dreamlight Valley is arriving at the start of next month. The Toy Story realm joins Disney Dreamlight Valley on December 6, 2022.
The new update will arrive on all platforms on December 6, adding the new realm and Toy Story leads Woody and Buzz to the game. Plus, there are some Toy Story cosmetics in store for Disney Dreamlight Valley players to collect.
We got a good look at what&#x27;s in store for the new area in a recent trailer. It highlights what&#x27;s in store for intrepid Dreamlight Valley players who wander into Andy&#x27;s Room.

Buzz Lightyear definitely looks like Buzz Lightyear, but Woody has some wild energy to him. The animations are really moving, in a way that makes me think this cowboy will definitely jump-scare at least one player on a stream.
That said, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the way Disney Dreamlight Valley reimagines some popular Disney characters. Mickey&#x27;s entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.
Venture into the valley
Disney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It&#x27;s a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.
We&#x27;ll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.

The tactics genre is an old one, and few stand out like Tactics Ogre. The original Let Us Cling Together has hit a number of devices, from the SNES to the PlayStaiton, on to the PSP and finally, with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, our current crop of modern consoles and PC.
Reborn is a remaster of a remake, bringing forward the PSP strategy classic to somewhere it’s more readily playable and fine-tuning it in the process. There are tons of videos and resources out there to grapple with all the changes, massive and miniscule, that Square Enix has made to this classic.

Nintendo has announced that will be adding golf to its sporting compendium Nintendo Switch Sports next week. The game enjoyed by rich capitalists and corrupt officials the world over will find itself added — free of charge — for all players on Monday, November 28.
The golf update will feature an adaptation of the much-enjoyed Wii Sports golf effort, complete with all of that title&#x27;s 21 holes. Also included is a new &quot;Survival Golf&quot; tournament mode, which will support up to eight players online in a knockout competition to complete holes in the fewest strokes possible.
Of course, casual local play with pals will also be available, so you can probably get your relatives up off of the sofa this Holiday season. Spirit of &#x27;09 is back in action, baby.
Nintendo Switch Sports is available now on... Nintendo Switch, naturally.

Japanese studio Edia has announced that it is currently developing retro compilation Telenet Shooting Collection for Nintendo Switch. The compendium features a small handful of shmups that jetted out of developer Telenet Japan in the early &#x27;90s, finding an audience on Sega Mega Drive and PC Engine.
The new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era&#x27;s formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-&#x27;em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.

The Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.
Additionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title&#x27;s official release. With the archiving of gaming&#x27;s earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.
In related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.

Ah, the &quot;Cha Cha Slide.&quot; A simple, groovy party song that somehow wormed its way into every elementary school gym class in America. There&#x27;s truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the &quot;Cha Cha Slide&quot; has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.
I had almost completely forgotten the &quot;Cha Cha Slide&quot; even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It&#x27;s surprising how well the &quot;Cha Cha Slide&quot; translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.
https://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496
According to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the &quot;Cha Cha Slide&quot; in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here&#x27;s hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.
As much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we&#x27;re all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.

Nintendo Japan has released a new trailer for its upcoming fantasy epic Fire Emblem Engage, which launches on Nintendo Switch in January of the new year. The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as &quot;Emblem Rings&quot;.
The Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.

As they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth. But maybe there will be more rings to be discovered, (or purchased), as the quest continues.
Fire Emblem Engage launches January 20, 2023 on Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, Fallout 76 is still around, and still pushing out major free updates. On December 6, the &quot;Nuka-World on Tour&quot; expansion is set to drop,
Bethesda and the powers that be are still pushing the &quot;Fallout 1st&quot; subscription, and it&#x27;ll apparently offer a new feature called the &quot;ammo storage box.&quot; Yep, it&#x27;s exactly how it sounds, as the team is offering &quot;unlimited space to store all your excess munitions [with the exception of Plasma Cores and Fusion Cores.&quot; It&#x27;s fascinating to see premium elements that impact direct gameplay creep in over time, and how the community responds to it.
Whether you&#x27;re thinking about jumping back in or you&#x27;re excited for the update: there&#x27;s some gameplay and developer commentary you can watch below. One of the best parts of the episode is actually near the start, where Carl McKevitt, senior quest designer, talks about how they carved out an existing area to make room for the actual &quot;tour&quot; in the Nuka-World on Tour location.
We don&#x27;t really have a clear view of many things coming after this, so we&#x27;ll see what 2023 brings. Next up, the team promises an update on December 1 with more info on Nuka-World on Tour.

Electronic Arts&#x27; return to college football is still a ways off. EA Sports confirms it&#x27;s aiming for a summer 2024 revival of its college football series.
Speaking to ESPN, EA Sports VP and general manager Daryl Holt said the timing is due to how much of an undertaking this will be.
&quot;That&#x27;s the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations,&quot; Holt told ESPN. &quot;And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We&#x27;re trying to build a very immersive college football experience.&quot;
Part of this involves use real college football players in the game. Before, using players&#x27; likeness in a new EA Sports college football seemed like a non-starter. But as Holt describes it, &quot;the road&#x27;s open now, but it&#x27;s still under construction.&quot;
This echoes some comments from July 2021 about the possibility of using real players in the virtual experience. An EA source told ESPN that players will be compensated if they appear in-game.

Back to school
EA first announced back in February of 2021 that college football would be returning to the EA Sports fold. Alongside today&#x27;s window, EA also confirms that both Road to Glory and Dynasty modes will be in store for the new series.
Since we&#x27;ve been without virtual college football since 2013, this news probably sparks some hope for fans of the sport. That being said, player likenesses and compensation still seem to be a lingering question mark. At the very least, a summer 2024 window gives Electronic Arts some time to figure it all out.

Rainbow Six Siege is about to enter the final season of its seventh year, with the arrival of new event Operation Solar Raid. Not only will this season bring players an intriguing new operator, but it will also add some long-awaited new features to R6S including the long-in-development crossplay and cross-progression.
Rainbow Six Siege players can now link their accounts across multiple platforms via Ubisoft Connect, transferring their rosters, purchased items, currencies, Battle Pas progress, and statistics to all PC and console accounts, (while also earning a free Alpha Pack for the trouble). Once connected, players can start doorkicking with or against their friends across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. If, however, this is not your vibe, t…</span>

Magic: The Gathering&#x27;s Jumpstart 2022 line is set to debut on December 2, and will once again inject cards both old and new into the gametype. As a reminder, Jumpstart is a product intended literally jumpstart quick games, by smashing up multiple thematic boosters: Angels and Dogs, Rogues and Pirates, that sort of thing.
This 2022 set is available in paper Magic, and although it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m constantly playing, it&#x27;s a nice thing to come back to, and have sets ready for. It has also been confirmed that Jump Start 2022 would not make it into Arena. Without further ado, onto the card previews!

                              <span>And you won&#x27;t believe who is bringing the goods
The legendary Japanese release Tetris: The Grand Master, considered by aficionados the most difficult release in the iconic block-dropping series, is finally coming to PS4 and Nintendo Switch. The almost mythic puzzler will launch in the near future courtesy of, of all people, Hamster&#x27;s Arcade Archives range.
Developed by Arika, and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master follows the typical ruleset of Alexey Pajitnov genre-defining classic, but offers up a staggering 999 levels of play and introduces the &quot;20G&quot; mechanic beloved by dedicated players. Essentially, this mechanic sees blocks appear directly on top of the wall, offering the player a split-second to effectively move them into place.
Check out the wild action in the classic run below, courtesy of YouTuber Sega-16.

Tetris: The Grand Master is recognized by the Tetris community&#x27;s expert players and speedrunners — those who you see performing almost reality-breaking feats of organization at events such as Awesome Games Done Quick, (or alternately, my friend Jonster, whose own Tetris skills leave me utterly flabbergasted. Look how happy he is in this tweet!). While TGM would receive several readily available sequels, this Arcade Archives release will represent the original&#x27;s first-ever home release outside of Japan, and as such is a major reckoning for Tetris players.
No date has been revealed for the title&#x27;s launch but, as regular readers will be aware, we cover each and every Arcade Archives release right here on Destructoid, and have done so for many, many years. Thus, we&#x27;ll be sure to let you know when TGM is headed to a platform near you. In the meantime, get practicing.

                              <span>Version .13.0.0
As Monster Hunter Rise continues to trek into 2023, we have one more major patch scheduled for November 24.
&quot;Version .13.0.0&quot; will be implemented this week, and will add more rewards, monsters, quests, and cosmetic paid DLC. After that, we have the &quot;winter 2023&quot; Free Title Update 4, followed by another one in the spring.
There&#x27;s way, way more on the game&#x27;s official site: but you can read the highlights below. Thankfully, Capcom has continued the tradition of breaking down individual items that will apply to the game as a whole, and stuff that only will work if you have the Sunbreak DLC.

                              <span>Project Winter is one of the best social deduction games you can play on your PC. You could uncharitably call it the grumpy rules lawer uncle of Among Us, smothering the raw thrill of lies and accusation beneath a blanket of systems and complexities. I had an absolute blast with it a few years ago, though, and for my money the highs absolutely make that blanket worth snuggling under.
I get to tell you about it again because the Power Balance: Vol 2 Update came out last week, adding a couple more roles and new systems that give traitors more strategies to turn to.

                              <span>If Twitter does die, I will miss it. Amidst the wailing lie certain gems, like this thread of developers sharing confessions and cheeky tricks from across their careers. We&#x27;re talking cobbling rat-tunnel ducts together to form a makeshift flare launcher in Dishonored, or using the bottom of a bleach bottle as a stand-in for a light fixture. I&#x27;ve picked out some of my favourites - come and revel in them with me.

                              <span>Obligatory ahoy, pirates. Season 8 of Sea Of Thieves goes live tomorrow, bringing on-demand ship combat and a faction system that pits goodly ghost-pirates against evil skeleton-pirates. It&#x27;s all woven into the existing open world, with your ship plunging beneath the waves when you tell it you want to go a-hunting.
If you want more info, you can watch the devs launch into an appropriately deep dive in their latest update video.

All four are now significantly cheaper than they were on launch, and with similar discounts to DDR5 RAM and AM5 motherboards, it&#x27;s a great time to build a new Ryzen 7000 PC.

A 15-person mapping team has channelled all the grief and rage from Foddy&#x27;s hit fall &#x27;em up into a 15-story tower that genuinely hurts my eyes to look at.
There&#x27;s a $500+ prize pool to be shared between the first three people who can complete the damn thing. The map came out five days ago, and as yet nobody has.

                              <span>There was a period, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, where myself and a few friends – even some that don’t normally indulge in games – played little else besides Golf With Your Friends. It’s a 12-player crazy golf game that dials up the crazy, and as we soon found back in those pre-vaccine days, one that reaches a whole other level of club-and-ball chaos with a single settings tweak.


See, with ball collision switched off, Golf With Your Friends is pretty fun. The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Series era Wireless Controller is one of the best options for PC gaming, and now it&#x27;s down to £29.99 at Currys when you use the code FNDDGAMING and choose to collect. These controllers normally retail £54.99, making this a solid £25 discount! 
This is one of the best early Black Friday PC deals we&#x27;ve spotted so far, and well worth picking up for games that benefit from controller input, like those in the racing, platformer, action and fighting genres. Of course, it&#x27;s also an essential pickup if you like playing around with emulators, and of course works on two generations of Xbox consoles as well.

                              <span>Battle royales can be very confusing, what with all the running and gunning. What if you could just lie there and let the weapons deal with all that shooting hassle by themselves? One Warzone 2 player happened across exactly that scenario, but it didn’t do them much good. Appearances can be deceiving though, so it’s not entirely clear how a gun can start shooting itself. That sure does seem buggy.

                              <span>Cute and compelling life simulator My Time At Sandrock is bringing back characters from My Time At Portia, along with new areas to explore and quests to give their lives purpose. If you played Portia and bid sad goodbyes to Albert, Mint and Musa, you can look forward to being reunited over an extra 5-10 hours of dungeons, romance and whatnot when the Old Pals update lands on November 24th.
I haven&#x27;t played either game, but Steve Hogarty described Sandrock as &quot;Stardew Valley with a gun&quot;, so I probably should.

Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&#x27;s journey comes to an end on December 6th with the arrival of title update 1.6.2 for the historical action RPG, along with the free The Last Chapter DLC. That concludes Eivor’s story, but unfortunately you won’t be able to continue your medieval adventures in New Game Plus. Ubisoft have confirmed that there won’t be any such mode coming to the game.

                              <span>Season 2 of Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus began last week, bringing with it a fresh battle pass for players to dig into. They’ll definitely be digging for a while too, because this season the amount of XP needed to complete the battle pass has nearly doubled. As MultiVersus tweeter and data miner LaisulMV noted, to complete the original Season 1 battle pass you’d need to accrue 47,650 XP to make it from Level 1 to Level 50. Season 2’s battle pass, on the other hand, requires a total of 87,450 XP. Levels 41-50 alone take almost as much effort as the first season’s entire battle pass, weighing in at 46,200 XP.

                              <span>Morning everyone. Black Friday 2022 is upon us and we’ll be covering it a bit differently to previous years – better, hopefully, albeit still in a way where an explanation might help. Basically, we’ll still be highlighting good hardware deals through our Black Friday hubs and the occasional standalone post, but this time we’re teaming up with our Gamer Network friends/colleagues/corporate co-underlings at Eurogamer and Digital Foundry to share the load.

                              <span>Warzone 2 deployed less than a week ago, and players are already experiencing déjà vu because of an outbreak of invisible players. This isn’t the first time the Warzone series has been affected by glitchy, unseen combatants, but we don’t have any answers yet for why it’s happening again. The invisibility glitch had attention drawn to it over the weekend, when streamer SuperEv shared a video of being taken out by another player who didn’t seem to be there. The Warzone 2.0 Trello board listing known issues with the game doesn’t show any mention of known invisibility bugs yet, so stay frosty.

When users tried to access illegal streams, a warning message claimed that they had already been tracked. With fines now being received through the mail, police are making some extraordinary claims about how this was made possible.

Jak tvrdí Stefan Karpinski, jeden z tvůrců Julie a spoluzakladatel společnosti, „people in the Julia community often think the company is already named JuliaHub. It only makes sense to rename the company to reflect that focus and direction.“</span>

                              <span>The AMD EPYC 4th Gen &quot;Genoa&quot; processor performance has been outright phenomenal. These new AMD server processors have shown stunnning performance with up to 96 cores per socket and beyond the increased core count is now up to 12 channels of DDR5-4800 memory and most significantly in the HPC space is the introduction of AVX-512 support with Zen 4. Even the 32-core high frequency Genoa performance has been dominating against Intel&#x27;s current Xeon Scalable competition. While AMD EPYC Genoa brings very impressive gains generation-over-generation and against the current Xeon Ice Lake CPUs, curiosity got the best of me for seeing how the new AMD EPYC CPUs compare to AMD&#x27;s original EPYC 1st Gen &quot;Naples&quot; flagship - the EPYC 7601 2P. Here are Genoa benchmarks showing how far the AMD server/HPC CPU performance has evolved over the past five years since Naples.</span>

                              <span>I was once a regular Counter-Strike player, but that was almost twenty years ago. What&#x27;s remarkable about Valve&#x27;s team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1? Still pretty much how they were when I was first mishandling them in the Half-Life mod. 

Which makes yesterday&#x27;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update pretty remarkable. The AWP&#x27;s magazine size has been cut in half and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long range.

                              <span>At this point, I&#x27;d consider the wacky bugs continually introduced to The Sims 4 as more of a feature than a bug. For example, a recent update turned previously placid Sims into moody, argumentative jerks who were constantly scrapping with one another. That sounds great to me, although if you disagree there&#x27;s bad news. EA Maxis say that their fix, intended to release this past week, has been delayed until early December.

Valve have announced it&#x27;ll begin on Tuesday, November 22nd and run for a week until November 29th.

                              <span>I recently bought a new hoover, or I suppose a first hoover, the first hoover which I actually own. After decades of whichever crap hoover my landlords dumped in a flat cupboard rather than throw away, here I am, a hoover owner. Did you know: a hoover, when pushed over a floor, will suck up dust? And keep the dust inside? Amazing. Genuinely a joy to be doing a bit of hoovering this week. Plus I bought a Shark, and Shark owners seem to get very excited when they hear someone has bought a Shark, so I guess I&#x27;m now part of a(nother) gang. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

During Asia Cup 2022, a cricket tournament watched by 200 million people in its first week, PikaShow was unveiled as the official sponsor of Afghanistan&#x27;s national cricket team, guaranteeing hours of pirate advertising to a TV audience of millions. Now its payback time.

Terayama, member of Capcom&#x27;s in-house band, shows off the individual instruments that comprise Kimberly&#x27;s music, the process of revising a track based on work from the larger development team, and why Kimberly&#x27;s old-school tastes pair well with the game&#x27;s hip-hop inspirations.

The two take you through the game&#x27;s opening, showcasing what exactly you do in this Atari museum as its sole caretaker, from sweeping away dust to killing bugs and more. 
The two also discuss how presenting Atari games as a WarioWare-like microgame collection is the perfect way to showcase these classic titles. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the museum experience in the game gives players the chance to admire high-quality screens of classic Atari game box art, game manuals, and more.

                              <span>Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. 
According to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. 
Yuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  
This is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams.

                              <span>Each time we start up a new mainline Pokémon game, we begin our journey with a choice. Sometimes it&#x27;s an easy one. Sometimes it&#x27;s agonizing. But regardless of where on that spectrum each generation lands for you, the general choice remains the same: grass, water, or fire. Thanks to the rock-paper-scissors nature of the types on offer, no one option is, by definition, superior. For Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, those types are represented through Sprigatito, Quaxly, and Fuecoco.
Now that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are officially out in the wild, we want to know which starter you&#x27;re rolling with. While you&#x27;re at it, which factors go into making your decision? Do you always choose that type? Did you research what the final evolutions look like? Or do you just go with your gut based on how they look and behave?
Let us know if you&#x27;re kicking off your Paldea region adventure with Sprigatito, Quaxly, or Fuecoco in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>After Z-Library was targeted by U.S. law enforcement, a group of anonymous archivists worked around the clock to get a shadow library search engine online. This week, the &#x27;team&#x27; behind the Pirate Library Mirror launched &quot;Anna&#x27;s Archive&quot; which offers a gateway to various book resources. A brazen move, but one where risks and privacy were carefully considered.

A decision handed down at the Tokyo District Court this week orders the pair to pay compensation of $3.56 million.

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s had to physically stop me from banging on about Black Sails will confirm that I love a bit of piracy. Games mostly don&#x27;t do it justice at all, either making &quot;piracy&quot; shorthand for &quot;mindless omnicide for no reason&quot; or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.
Buccaneers! isn&#x27;t primarily a piracy game, but they&#x27;re one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I&#x27;d call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It&#x27;s probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.

                              <span>I was already a reader of Robert Kirkman’s The Walking Dead comics when I picked up Telltale’s version on Steam in 2012. I came for the game’s resemblance to the art style from the funny books, but stayed because of its similarity to Kirkman’s excellent characterisation and shocking brutality. We are the Walking Dead, indeed. Telltale demonstrated they understood that from the start of this series.

Until then, you can play with your boomstick in co-op multiplayer schlockfest Evil Dead: The Game, and there&#x27;s tactical role-player Dark Deity too.

                              <span>At some point since I played Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered, a switch has flipped in me; I have gone from having stepped off the MCU train, content to watch it chug off into the distance with its remaining passengers, to actively wishing for its violent derailment. I&#x27;m saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.
Spider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac&#x27;s first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It&#x27;s a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it&#x27;s still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it&#x27;s shorter.

                              <span>I came, I saw, I claimed some free DLC. That’s probably what Julius Caesar would say about being given away for Sid Meier’s Civilization 6, right? Well, whatever his nibs might think about the offer, you’ll be able to pick him up for nowt from November 21st. There’s only one catch, and that’s needing to link your 2K account on Steam or the Epic Games Store. Have a watch of the trailer below to see what ol’ leaf-ears has to offer your Romans.

                              <span>For somehow the second time in my life, I recently found myself in deeply urgent need of a 4K gaming monitor. An RTX 4090 review deadline was rapidly approaching, any suitably UHD-specced loaner monitors I could use for testing had been sent back, and my backup – a nasty little 60Hz screen – wasn’t going to cut it. Unwilling to prostrate myself for another loan model and reluctant to burn such a vast hole in RPS’s expenses budget, I elected for the fastest, easiest option of just buying one myself.

In particular, Zarya’s particle barrier duration has been reduced, so you should have an easier team taking her on in future. Blizzard announced there’d be a delay to the balance adjustment update earlier this week, which had been scheduled for November 15th.

Naka is alleged to have bought around 10,000 shares in Dragon Quest Tact developers Aiming back in 2020 for ¥2.8 million (£16,800). At that point, Naka was still working with Square Enix on Balan Wonderworld.

It’s the first time we’ve got anything close to a glimpse of the remake, still in its early prototyping stage, could look like. The seven slices of concept art were shown as part of Splinter Cell’s 20th anniversary.

Last week I ran some initial AOCC 4.0 benchmarks and this LLVM/Clang downstream was looking rather favorable in relation to upstream LLVM/Clang, while since then I&#x27;ve been able to conduct more thorough benchmarks across a wide variety of C/C++ open-source workloads. Here is that more extensive round of AOCC 4.0 benchmarking against the open-source LLVM/Clang and AOCC compilers.</span>

With search warrants directed at Google and Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t hard for the FBI to connect the dots.

                              <span>Ubisoft celebrated Spinter Cell’s 20th anniversary by releasing a new video reflecting on the series and discussing its upcoming remake. The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. 


The Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. 
The dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. 

Splinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.</span>

                              <span>Trinity Fusion is an upcoming futuristic sci-fi action-roguelite that looks great, and its first closed beta begins today. 
Developer Angry Mob Games announced today that you can sign up for the beta right now, which will run through November 24. If you don&#x27;t make it into this round of playtesting, don&#x27;t worry – you might get an invite to access the second closed beta beginning December 6. It will run until December 13. Before signing up, though, check out the Trinity Fusion reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Trinity Fusion looks like a fun and stylish take on the ever-growing roguelite genre, bringing some Strider vibes with a dash of Trine in there too.

                              <span>Update, 11/17/2022:
Earlier this year, Supermassive Games filed multiple trademarks for new games that many predicted were part of its Dark Pictures anthology series. One of those games was Directive 8020 and now, with the latest anthology game, The Devil In Me, out tomorrow, it&#x27;s been confirmed that Directive 8020 is up next. It will be the Season 2 premiere of The Dark Pictures series. 
This news comes by way of GameTrailers, who spotted the teaser trailer for Directive 8020 as part of The Devil In Me&#x27;s release, keeping in tradition with the latest game teasing the next game, as reported by Destructoid.
Check out the teaser trailer for The Dark Pictures: Directive 8020 for yourself below:

                              <span>Saints Row, a reboot for the series, was released back in August and while some players were happy with the end result, others were not. And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company&#x27;s second-quarter earning results. 


&quot;The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,&quot; Wingefores said in the statement. &quot;The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.&quot;
Wingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an &quot;internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,&quot; but says that &quot;it is not necessarily the last.&quot; 
Saints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 has been delayed to April. 
Originally due out on February 3, this upcoming zombie romp will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 28. It&#x27;s a delay of roughly 12 weeks, which isn&#x27;t too much longer considering fans have been waiting close to a decade for this sequel. As for why developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver have delayed Dead Island 2, the team wants more time to ensure the game is the best it can be at launch. 
Here&#x27;s the full statement on the delay: 
While waiting to learn more about the game next month, watch the Dead Island 2 re-reveal trailer from earlier this summer and then watch our exclusive interview with the devs about the game&#x27;s procedurally generated gore system.

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet hit store shelves and the Switch eShop tomorrow. Chances are, you&#x27;re seeing some reviews pop up right about now. While we would love to be one of those reviews, we&#x27;re not quite ready to publish our final verdict for a couple of reasons. First, the online servers are not yet available, and with four-player co-op serving as a big addition to the series, we want to fully test it out before delivering our review. I also just want a tad more time with the game before slapping a score on it; I&#x27;ve finished most of the main story, but I haven&#x27;t fully explored the end and post-game content. 
However, now that the review embargo is up, I can provide my full impressions before publishing my final review. I&#x27;m generally positive about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. These are goo…</span>

                              <span>In August, an Indian court ordered domain registrars including NameCheap, Tucows, Dynadot, and Sarek Oy to disable several pirate site domains. They failed to comply so the judge has just ordered two government agencies to take immediate action. Among other things, they must determine if the domain companies should even be allowed to do business in India.

                              <span>The long-awaited Pokémon Trading Card Game Live app is now available in beta worldwide on PC and mobile devices after a staggered rollout last month. The successor to the now-defunct Pokémon Trading Card Game Online game has been in the works since its reveal last September. 
For fans of the previous mobile game, TCG Live aims to offer a more polished, robust digital card game experience. You can collect cards either by scanning code cards or purchasing booster packs with digital currency earned in-game by completing quests and working through battle passes.
Players represent themselves with a customizable avatar and can challenge players to matches across the globe. It also sports a much sleeker presentation. Essentially, TCG Live is positioned as the Pokémon equivalent of modern card game apps such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. Check out the original teaser trailer below.


Since the game is in beta, expect updates to roll out over the coming weeks/months. Pokémon TCG Live can be played on iOS, Android, and is downloadable on PC.</span>

Developer Player First Games has detailed what to expect in Season 2 of MultiVersus and it looks to be packing quite the punch. Following the inclusion of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith from Rick and Morty near the end of Season 1, it seems classic cartoon character Marvin the Martian will be next to join the roster. 
&quot;New roster additions are incredibly exciting, so we figured we&#x27;d give you a bit of a tease of one of the new characters who will be joining the MVS roster in Season 2,&quot; a blog post about the new season reads. &quot;Hailing from planet Mars and sent to destroy Earth with his Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, M…</span>

                              <span>If we&#x27;ve learned anything from Marvel&#x27;s comics and cinematic universe, it&#x27;s that the world is always expanding. New villains are always emerging and new heroes are always swooping in to stop them. Crystal Dynamics is taking this same approach with its game starring Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes. Marvel&#x27;s Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that&#x27;s far from all the heroes we&#x27;ll be able to take control of when it&#x27;s all said and done. Crystal Dynamics has said that all playable characters will be added at no additional cost, but additional upgrades for those characters could cost money.
Check out all the characters you can play as in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, as well as all the heroes still to come.

The best stories in video games manage to fuse narrative, art, and gameplay in a way that elevates all three. Pentiment, the latest from Obsidian Entertainment, is a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.
Pentiment tells the story of traveling artist Andreas Maler and his time spent in Tassing, a fictional town …</span>

                              <span>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet have been officially announced, complete with a reveal trailer that includes a first look at the starters this time around. 
These two games represent the start of Generation 9, which will surely bring its own competitive meta, anime, and even Pokémon card series to the franchise, and we can&#x27;t wait. However, there&#x27;s still some time before we actually get to play these games, so for now, we&#x27;ll be scanning every second of the reveal trailer (and subsequent trailers) for new locales, features, and of course, Pokémon. 


As any Pokémon player knows, with each generation comes two games to choose from. This time around, it&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet (is this a callback to Red and Blue, perhaps?). With two different versions, there are always some differences between…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo and Game Freak have released an overview trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, showcasing more than five minutes of new footage. 
Hot on the heels of the official release of Pokémon&#x27;s ninth gen this Friday, this overview trailer will get you prepared for your upcoming journey through Paldea. Veteran trainers will recognize a lot of what the trailer is breaking down, like how your journey begins by picking a starter, but this overview trailer also breaks down a lot of the new things happening in these games. This includes the fact that you can tackle the gyms in any order, freely explore Paldea, and infiltrate the Team Star bases scattered around the region. 
Check out the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet overview trailer for yourself below:


As you can see, this trailer is packed with lots of new looks at characters we&#x27;ll meet in Paldea, new Pokémon to catch and party up with, and more.

Somerville begins with a peek into the life of a young family and their dog. Everyone fell asleep watching TV on the couch, but the curious toddler gets themselves into some inconsequential trouble, forcing the family into their routine. Both the child and dog need to be fed and the kitchen needs to be cleaned, but something feels off. In an explosive moment that truly caught me by surprise, the family is suddenly reckoning with an alien invasion. An intense, often scary adventure kicks off from there. When Somerville hits its highs and fires on…</span>

                              <span>The end of Fortnite Chapter 3 is upon us as Epic Games has revealed that its finale event will take place next month. 
More specifically, the finale event will take place on December 3 at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET. This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer. You can see the title card at the top of this story, if you&#x27;re curious. 
Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all that Epic Games teased in terms of the end of Fortnite&#x27;s Fracture era. As for what&#x27;s in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. 
If it&#x27;s anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter.

                              <span>Save Room wears its inspiration on its sleeve from the moment you hit start and a deep, scary voice announces that you&#x27;re playing &quot;Save Room!&quot; It takes a singular idea from Resident Evil 4 – organizing your briefcase of weapons – and expands it into a dedicated puzzle game. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they play through a few of the puzzles now that the game has made its way to consoles.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel&#x27;s development status. 
According to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. 
The press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. 
“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”
This announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.</span>

                              <span>Escapism increases with yet another ScummVM release!
The ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of ScummVM 2.6.1.
ScummVM 2.6.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on improving the new features and engines we introduced in our previous release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines:
AGS
AGOS
Asylum
Ultima
SCI
SCUMM
Tinsel
Toltecs
Toon
Other improvements include upgrading the icon-based grid view in the ScummVM launcher and fixing OpenGL render graphic corruptions.
Finally, Android users will be able to properly use a mouse on virtual screens, and Windows users will not have any duplicated icons folder issues.
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, the Ubuntu Snap package or the FlatHub repository, the auto-update robots will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.1.
As always, the detailed list of improvements is available here.
Thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

                              <span>Are you spooked? We are too with this spooky release date, even if nothing in OpenTTD itself is spooky. Luckily, I can offer you the first testing release of the 13.X release series. We collected whatever we could find on the cutting room floor to get you a Halloween release. Some of the higlights of this release include: Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag. Wider rivers on map generation. Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens. Some more GUI improvements like a cleaned up finance window. Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions. (As ever, see the changelog for further details). The usual titlegame competition has been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>
