The strand genre is moving to the silver screen. Kojima Productions is teaming up with Hammerstone Studios to produce a film adaptation of Death Stranding.
Hideo Kojima will produce alongside Hammerstone Studios&#x27; Alex Lebovici, who executive produced this year&#x27;s surprise horror hit Barbarian. The film is being fully financed by Hammerstone (per Variety), with Kojima Productions US and Allan Ungar as executive producers.
The plot, according to Variety, is being kept under wraps, though the outlet&#x27;s heard that it will introduce new elements and characters. No writer or director is publicly locked in yet.
&quot;We are thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to partner with brilliant and iconic Hideo Kojima on his first film…</span>

Autumn Games has revealed its plans for the coming year as it pertains to the fantastic Skullgirls 2nd Encore, which has, impressively, enjoyed a full decade of exciting, tag-fighting action — fending off competition from a plethora of fighting game releases, large and small, to carve itself a niche in the competitive scene.
And it seems that the party is only just getting started.

As we enter 2023, Skullgirls 2nd Encore will begin a year-long rollout of new characters, console ports, balance updates, and new merchandise, celebrating a full decade of fist-throwin&#x27;, hair-slammin&#x27;, charleston-boppin&#x27; action.

Of the four World Warriors making a fresh appearance at The Game Awards last week, only one would be recognizable to the Street Fighter faithful — Having taken time out from the series for a few years, Street Fighter 6 will see the return of the ultimate party animal and dance hall superstar, Dee Jay Maximum!
Dee Jay made his Street Fighter debut way back in 1993, as one of the four new faces added to the legendary Super Street Fighter II. Hailing from Jamaica, Dee Jay is local superhero, renowned for his loud, brash, all-night parties, excellent musicianship, and infectiously upbeat personality. Rarely seen without a toothy smile plastered across his jaw, Dee Jay is easily one of the SF universe&#x27;s most happy-go-lucky characters, living his best life without a care in t…</span>

                              <span>Lara heads to a new home
Amazon Games and Crystal Dynamics have entered a new partnership to publish the latter&#x27;s upcoming Tomb Raider project. The new multiplatform entry in the story of Lara Croft will receive support and publishing help from Amazon.
The announcement today confirms Crystal Dynamics&#x27; newest partner on the project, following the studio getting acquired by the Embracer Group. The press release also confirms this will be a single-player, narrative-driven Lara Croft adventure. Crystal Dynamics will continue to develop, while Amazon provides support and globally publishes the still-unnamed Tomb Raider.
&quot;Crystal Dynamics has an extraordinary opportunity following our acquisition by Embracer to redefine what a publishing relationship is for Tomb Raider,&quot; said Crystal Dynamics head Scot Amos in a press release. &quot;Transformative is what we’re looking for, and with Amazon Games, we found a team that shares our creative vision, ambitions, and values for a Lara Croft universe across the spectrum of possibilities.&quot;
The new Tomb Raider is also being built in Unreal Engine 5. Lara&#x27;s new adventure is still in early development, but today&#x27;s news promises there will still be enemies to take down and puzzles to solve in the new Tomb Raider.
A new benefactor
For Amazon, the online shopping giant picks up another publishing deal with this project. Bandai Namco&#x27;s Blue Protocol is also joining up with Amazon for publishing, helping the online RPG launch sometime next year.
Meanwhile, for Crystal Dynamics, the deal ensures some support for the next big Croft game. The studio is saying it will be the &quot;biggest&quot; and &quot;most expansive&quot; to date. It&#x27;s also set to carry on Lara Croft&#x27;s story, though in what manner that happens remains to be seen.

Activision Blizzard sequel Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is opening the doors to all and sundry today, as the gazillion-dollar shooter launches its first free multiplayer weekend. Players on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox can download a truncated version of the title for free to check out its hi-octane action.
The trial kicks off today and will run until Monday, December 19 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. During that time, squaddies can check out a variety of Modern Warfare II multiplayer modes including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and, my own personal specialty, Kill Confirmed. Three maps will be made available for digital pew-pew desires — namely Farm 18, El Asilo, and the recently added battlezone, Shipment, which features a ton of containers and blind corners for all your hide &#x27;n&#x27; seek needs.
Launching in October of this year, Modern Warfare II was mostly well-received by critics and fans, praising its top-tier visuals and atmosphere, while chastising the franchise&#x27;s general sense of repetition even when bolstered by the power of the ninth generation of gaming. The campaign mode serves as both a reboot and a prequel to the original Modern Warfare canon, and sees Task Force 141 attempt to take down a global weapons cartel.
Call of Duty Modern Warfare II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

This is it! We&#x27;re in the quieter time of gaming now, with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion in the rear view. River City Girls 2 is the only marquee game highlighted by Nintendo this week, and one of the last arguably bigger games to come out in 2022. It&#x27;s been a heck of a year! You can celebrate with us now in our annual Game of the Year posts.
You earned the rest, I think! 2022 has had a lot of ups and downs, and the entire gaming industry is included in that ebb and flow. Here&#x27;s to a better overall 2023.

                              <span>The Most Electrifying DLC in MultiVersus Today
Things have been a mite quiet in the world of MultiVersus since it began its second season, but the cartoonish brawler is happily ticking along, welcoming players into its marvelous mash-up of movie, comic book, and television stars. In fact, a new update launched today, bringing with it a new stage, a new character skin, and several fun, festive accessories.
First and foremost, &quot;The Man in Black&quot; skin is coming for DC anti-hero Black Adam, offering him the cinematic visage of Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson from the recent DCU movie — (which may, apparently, be part of the final hurrah for this incarnation of the troubled big screen series). Alongside Black Adam, a new stage has arrived, based on the sword-swinging series Game of Thrones. The new stage comes complete with a rendition of the show&#x27;s theme, and finally gives launch character Arya Stark a place to call home.
Lookit her! What a cutie pie!

Getting into the holiday spirit, MultiVersus has also launched a limited-time event known as &quot;FestiVersus&quot;. For the coming weeks, players will be able to earn special cookies in battle, which can be exchanged for a variety of festive profile items and accessories, including avatars, stickers, and ring-out effects. Additionally, a selection of &quot;Ugly Sweaters&quot; will be available for some of the roster, ensuring that everyone is feeling the holiday spirit, whether they&#x27;d like to or not.
The new MultiVersus update launches today on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Unfortunately, it seems that this will be the only place where you&#x27;ll see Black Adam battle Superman anytime soon.

                              <span>Sephiroth and Kazuya are right around the corner
Well, Nintendo finally gave us amiibo collectors a lifeline, and revealed the full release date for the Sephiroth and Kazuya figures: January 13, 2023. That&#x27;s soon! Amid that announcement, Nintendo has noted that folks should &quot;look forward to the release of Pyra and Mythra,&quot; which is coming at some point in 2023.
Based on prior release cadences, Smash amiibo release waves are typically five-ish months apart, but they could be coming out sooner than that. In Japan, Pyra and Mythra are being sold as a double pack, but it&#x27;s not clear if that format will be the standard around the world. All that&#x27;s left on the amiibo list now for Super Smash Bros. is Sora. We haven&#x27;t had full confirmation of his figure yet, or when it might release: but mid-to-late-2023 could be possible.
Right now there are no pre-orders available in most regions of the world. However, the Nintendo of Japan store does have all of the above (sans Sora): though they immediately sold out:
Sephiroth
Kazuya
Pyra/Mythra double pack
As always, here&#x27;s a full up to date amiibo list that we&#x27;ve been keeping track of since the beginning. You can also find full images of the amiibo models in the embedded tweet, or the gallery below.

                              <span>Do Not Aim at Face
Here&#x27;s a wonderful little comeback for one of the strangest but most wholesome franchises of all time: Sony Interactive Entertainment and developer Cosmo Machia have announced a brand new entry in the Fantavision franchise, Fantavision 202X, which is coming to PS5 and PSVR2 in February 2023.
As some of you may, or perhaps may not, know, Fantavision is something of a firework-based rhythm-action title, challenging players to detonate a colorful cacophony of rockets to the beat of the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Played with style and panache, this results in a dazzling spectacle of visual effects, played out against the backdrop of virtual skylines and starry nights. It&#x27;s a simple but fast-paced endeavor, rewarding players with great music and cheerful visuals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uo1vJBQ97to&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;PlayStationJapan
The original Fantavision served as a launch title for PlayStation 2, as the use of color and effects made it a great showcase for the debuting hardware. It would seem that Fantavision 202X hopes to do the same for the incoming unit PSVR2, and, powered by Unreal technology and the might of the PS5 platform, one can only imagine how immersive and entertaining the new game will be when experienced in virtual reality. You just need a mug of hot chocolate and a giant coat and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re right there.
Fantavision 202X will feature the same gameplay as its predecessors but will showcase fully dynamic 3D visuals, a replay mode, and the ability to pause and enjoy the action with a free-roaming camera. The trailer also appears to feature some way out new background settings, including a trip around planet Earth itself, as well as an anime-style space battle.
Fantavision 202X launches February 22, 2023 on PS5 and PSVR 2. Just remember, don&#x27;t pick up a sparkler once you&#x27;ve dropped it. Never return to a firework once lit, and if you fancy a jar, forget the car.

Developer Arc System Works has released a new update for its gorgeous anime fighter Guilty Gear Strive, bringing with it balance tweaks, bug fixes and, most notable of all, crossplay support between console and PC editions of the game.
Players on PS4, PS5, and PC can now all step into the ring against one another, as well as converge in lobbies, spectate each other&#x27;s matches and replays, view player profiles, and even check out the delightfully dioramic &quot;Digital Figure&quot; creations of their brethren. Additionally, PlayStation and PC players can also share the extremely useful &quot;Combo Maker&quot; mode with each other, helping all players to grow their pugilistic potential on all platforms.

                              <span>Oh, Holy Knight
Larian Studios now has a window for the full launch of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, but ahead of that, the studio is putting live a big update for the holiest and un-holiest of knights. The latest big update to the RPG was revealed today, adding the Paladin class, as well as some other tidbits leading up to the full launch.
With the addition of Patch 9, Paladin is now a class option in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. The critically over-zealous knights bring a lot of power to the party. Alongside that are two subclass options, adhering to the Paladin&#x27;s beliefs: the Oath of Devotion, and the Oath of the Ancients.
But if you just don&#x27;t like following the rules, there is always the evil option. Go back on your oath, and you can become an Oathbreaker. Larian&#x27;s Swen Vincke demonstrated this in today&#x27;s panel, by breaking his player character&#x27;s oaths and following in the path of an Oathbreaker Knight that visited his camp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hmi-QrT9br0
More features are in today&#x27;s Patch 9 update too. There&#x27;s a leval cap bump up to Level 5, the Fly spell has been added, the Reactions system has been revamped, and there&#x27;s even a ping system. Personally, I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;characters who attempt to play an instrument they&#x27;re not Proficient with now fail spectacularly.&quot; Good update.
A critical role
That&#x27;s all for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 now. But for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 in the future, there is another update: voice actor Matthew Mercer is joining the cast. Mercer will voice Minsc, who popped up during last week&#x27;s trailer at The Game Awards 2022. Minsc is a returning Baldur&#x27;s Gate companion, who&#x27;s been petrified for quite some time.
https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1603097534653554688
Though the big update&#x27;s here today, launch is still a ways off. Larian Studios is aiming to fully launch Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 in August 2023 on PC, after spending a few years in Early Access with a slice of its first act.

In 2020, developer Shiny Shoe solidified its status in the roguelite genre with Monster Train. The locomotive deckbuilder has been very well received, and it would&#x27;ve been easy to fall back into another one. And true enough, Shiny Shoe is making a roguelite again with Inkbound. But its tackling a different style combat, a fresh setting, and altogether interesting new challenge: a co-op rogue game.
I recently got the chance to run through a chunk of Inkbound, both in solo play and in co-op with the developers at Shiny Shoe. Over the course of a couple hours, I got a decent look at some of what the team is planning, from a seasonal structure to how its thinking about co-op options. And after all that, Inkbound has become one to watch moving into the ne…</span>

                              <span>The Game Awards in person are a doozy
Last month, I got a mysterious email in my inbox. What&#x27;s that? I was being invited to be a seat filler at The Game Awards? There&#x27;s no way this is legit. Oh wait, it is legit? Okay, I guess I can&#x27;t pass up on an opportunity to go to TGAs for free, right? Right. At least I&#x27;ll get some good content out of it.
For those who don&#x27;t know (because I certainly didn&#x27;t when I got that email), seat fillers are people that go to large, televised events like the Oscars or, in this case, The Game Awards, and sit in seats that are visible onscreen that would otherwise be empty. You&#x27;re basically a placeholder, and can be moved around if you&#x27;re in someone&#x27;s seat who comes late, or if they need people to fill out the front rows while presenters or award recipients go bac…</span>

Finji Games has been a part of bringing us some of the best indie games of the past few years, including but not limited to Tunic, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and I Was A Teenage Exocolonist. Now, Finji has just announced that two of their other popular indie titles, Overland and Night in the Woods, are natively available on the PlayStation 5. The real kicker, though, is that both of these games will run on the platform at a &quot;delicious&quot; 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, which is a big step up for smaller titles like these. What&#x27;s more, those who already own these games on the PS4 will receive the new PS5 versions for free.

If you&#x27;re looking for some nice new indies to play, or you simply enjoyed Overland or Night in the Woods and are looking to start another playthrough, it seems that now is the perfect time. These games don&#x27;t have any issues running on weaker consoles or PCs, because the reality is that they&#x27;re simply not all that demanding, but who can turn down the opportunity to play a game in 4K? It&#x27;s one of those things that may not always be necessary, but it certainly is nice to have regardless.
It&#x27;s cool to see huge games like The Witcher 3 get upgrades for the next gen, but I&#x27;m hoping that this move from Finji helps inspire other developers and publishers to make new ports for smaller games as well. Even years after its release, the PS5 library of games could still use some filling out, especially when it comes to indies. Plus, having the games look great and making them more readily available to a wider range of players might mean we see more people playing these indie darlings than before; there&#x27;s nothing that pleases me more than seeing gamers get into indie games for the first time, because there really is so much amazing stuff out there.

As if Sonic Origins, Sonic The Hedgehog 2 and Sonic Frontiers wasn&#x27;t enough hedgehog content for one year, you can now take the obsession even further and set your Netflix icon as one of the series&#x27; regulars (thanks, My Nintendo News).
Yes, this is finally a win for all those out there (and you know who you are) who always felt that the Netflix profile screen was missing some video game content. There are options a-plenty to choose from including Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Eggman and even Big the Cat.

We love a press release with a ton of puns, and A Little to the Left has them by the bundle. To celebrate the holiday season, the Nova Scotia-based development team Max Inferno have created a &quot;Good Tidyings&quot; event within the game, which comes with &quot;a seasonal spin on normal proceedings.&quot; That seasonal spin comes in the form of six new &quot;Yuletide disasters&quot; that need tidying up.
Of course, those surprises are under wraps for the moment, because what kind of monster peeks at an advent calendar early? Each day, from the 22nd December to the 27th, a new, seasonal puzzle will be revealed to players of A Little to the Left, with wintry twists on the tidying puzzle mechanics of the main game.

On top of the confirmation that amiibos will be compatible with the game, the trailer also provides a little more information on what we will be able to do in-between battles. These features include inheriting skills from Emblems, cooking stat-increasing meals and, of course, a fishing minigame.

Well, here&#x27;s something we didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be reporting on today. The popular energy drink company G-Fuel has announced that it will be releasing a special formula based on the boss character &#x27;The Great Mighty Poo&#x27; from Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day.
Shipping to customers in April 2023, the concoction is said to take inspiration from The Great Mighty Poo&#x27;s favourite food: corn. It&#x27;ll cost a rather hefty $59.99 but will also come packed with a Youtooz &#x27;The Mighty Poo&#x27; vinyl figure (which actually looks pretty cool and we almost want one ourselves...). You can pre-order one for yourself by heading over to the G-Fuel website right now.

Just this week Nintendo has provided us with our Switch Year in Review - a round-up of our most-played games for 2022 and in which months we were obsessed by them. Aside from a touching reminder that Big Bowser is always watching, the summaries provide a nice look at the year in focus, flagging the games that we loved, yes, but also prompting a certain amount of self-inspection when we inevitably think &quot;wait, I threw all those hours into that?!&quot;
If you are curious and want to check out how your Switch time was spent in 2022, head over to the following Nintendo page, sign into your account and let the memories come rushing back.

Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s latest update, which added Toy Story and Stitch to the game, has had a few teething issues — including players unable to get Woody, Buzz, or Stitch in their game at all thanks to some irritating bugs.
Gameloft has announced a new Hotfix Update to address these issues, hopefully fixing some of the quests so that players can complete them. It&#x27;s not confirmed what the Hotfix Update will include in its entirety, but here&#x27;s a short list that Gameloft posted on Twitter:

From now until 29th December, you can get up to 60% off (or more) of hundreds of games on the eShop — more for the backlog? Or perhaps more to sink your teeth into over the festive break?
There are a few big titles included in this year&#x27;s sale — which is only confirmed for Europe so far — such as the latest Sonic game and the new Mario + Rabbids adventure. Two games that were released in the last two months!? Oh, go on.

Raw Fury has shared a brand new trailer for the stunning-looking Minish-Cap-meets-Stardew-Valley deckbuilder Moonstone Island, showcasing one of the game&#x27;s key mechanics that sets it apart from other farming sims and deckbuilders — spirit taming!
Now, what&#x27;s your spirit animal? A cat? A tortoise? How about a sentient cup of coffee, or a fish bowl with legs? These are the kind of unusual spirits you can expect to meet as you venture around the 100 islands you can set foot on in the game. Each island has an associated element, and spirits of that same element will live on that island. You can battle them to banish them from the island, or if you like the look of them, you can get them to join you by feeding them the crops that you&#x27;ve worked hard to grow.

Wired Productions has announced that Arcade Paradise will be getting Kung Fury: Street Rage DLC on January 12th at a very reasonable price of $2.99 / €2.99 / £2.49.
The game itself is already available on Steam and was announced to be coming to the Switch earlier this year as an &#x27;Ultimate Edition&#x27;, but its DLC arrival on Arcade Paradise marks the first fully licensed and playable game to come to the game, joining over 35 existing, original titles already available.

                              <span>Breaking the chains of mediocrity.
About seven years ago, a solo indie developer named Matthias Linda began working on an idea he had for a new RPG, itself likely the product of many years of producing fan games based on his genre favorites in RPG Maker. After a successful Kickstarter in 2019 and who knows how many hours of painstaking iteration, Linda has finally seen his vision realized with the release of Chained Echoes. Luckily, this one turned out to be well worth the seven-year wait. Chained Echoes exudes confidence and quality at every turn and quickly establishes itself as one of the finest RPGs you can buy on the Switch right now.
Set on the continent of Valandis, it follows a motley crew of nobles, thieves, and mercenaries who all find their fates chained together in pursuit of a common cause. The story begins a few years before events kick off, with two of the mercenaries who will later be in your party inadvertently setting off the in-universe equivalent of a nuke during a battle in the war between three kingdoms. In the aftermath, the three kingdoms come to an uneasy truce, but various political and supernatural forces wish to plunge the continent into war once more, which inevitably leads to your party being formed to prevent this outcome.

It&#x27;s safe to say that we all love Switch games, but you know what&#x27;s better? Free Switch games. Fortunately, No Gravity Games is once again giving them out by the sack-load this December (if by &#x27;sack-load&#x27; you mean a maximum of 12, that is) as a part of the &#x27;12 Games of Christmas&#x27; - hey, it&#x27;s certainly one way of getting games out there.
The event began on 5th December and will run through until 16th December with a brand new game being made available for free on each day. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning right off the bat that this offer only applies to North American eShop accounts.

Fans of piercing noise might be pleased to hear that Play Nintendo - the official kid-led YouTube channel for all things Switch - is starting a new series called Kids Play! (no prizes for guessing what it entails).
Just in case you were wondering, the Kids Play! series will see different groups of children going head to head in a number of uber-clean family-friendly competitions on the Switch. The series trailer teases that there will be a good amount of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Party Superstars and Nintendo Switch Sports to be had, with the presenters&#x27; energy levels never being higher.

Spanish developer Aeternum Game Studios has announced that the follow-up to the Hollow Knight-inspired metroidvania Aeterna Noctis will be coming out of Early Access and landing on the Switch in 2023 (thanks, Go Nintendo).
The follow-up title, Summum Aeterna, looks to be just as difficult as its predecessor - and we&#x27;re not just talking about pronouncing its name. The game was teased as a part of the Aeternum Game Studios 2022 Showcase (found in the timestamped video above) and it promises some intense platforming action, boss fights a-plenty and a unique world generator in the new Seed Mechanic.

We get a good look at how players will be able to navigate the world, utilising objects and creatures like broomsticks, Hippogriffs, and Thestrals. It&#x27;s been confirmed that additional broomsticks can be purchased from a shop in Hogsmeade and, while these are purely for cosmetic purposes, you can apply general upgrades to your broom to improve speed and other attributes.

One of the most ambitious releases of the year was the new &quot;open-zone&quot; adventure, Sonic Frontiers. If you&#x27;re still not sure whether or not you would be interested in the Switch version of the game, Sega has now released a free demo on Japan&#x27;s eShop.
The demo is roughly 2.9GB in size and will allow players to try out the first 15 minutes of the title. It&#x27;s got full English language support as well. To access this demo, you&#x27;ll need to have created a Japanese Nintendo account, and from there you can boot up the digital store and download it.

                              <span>What better way to win back your community after the rocky launch of a new game than by providing a free &quot;upgrade&quot; to a beloved old game? I&#x27;ve no way of knowing if that&#x27;s what Volition thought as they followed the poor reception of the Saints Row reboot by earlier this month &quot;upgrading all copies&quot; of Saints Row IV to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected, a version of the outlandish 2013 action game which includes all previously released DLC.

Well, since the Season 01 Reloaded update arrived, you now have the option to ask enemy players for help and get to join their team if they do. There’s a whole bunch more stuff in the update including the new version of the Shipment map for Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer, which you take a look at in the video below.

There’s only a week and a bit to go before the day itself, and I’ve got all my decorations up and everything. I just haven’t found that festive groove. Cat-wrangling puzzler A Little To The Left has something in its Christmas sack that might spur on some kind of festive awakening though. Between December 22nd and 27th, A Little To The Left’s putting aside its Daily Tidy Delivery mode of randomly generated individual challenges to offer six holiday-themed messes for you to make spick and/or span. Cheers, Max Inferno.

Those two worked on The Expanse, and were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Children Of Men.

These sillies must be mistaken. Thankfully, after a couple of weeks with Lil Gator Game, I finally get it. All these people weren&#x27;t talking about the shoe, of course!

It doesn&#x27;t have the fast pace and stunning climax of Solitaire, y&#x27;know? So what if we jazz it up by smashing in another puzzle game. Like in Minesweeper Tetris, released for free on Steam this morning, which kinda adds Tetris by making the screen slowly fill in with fresh lines of mines, challenging you to clear mines quickly. It twists my melon, man.

                              <span>PlayStation has revealed that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 will hit PlayStation 5 sometime next fall. 
This news comes after leaks from earlier this week indicating the game would be hitting the console in the fall of 2023. It seems those leaks were correct. While we do have this fall 2023 release window, PlayStation did not reveal a release date. 


&quot;What a year it&#x27;s been for PlayStation Studios; here at Insomniac Games we&#x27;ve been in absolute awe of the work of our peers,&quot; Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar writes in a PlayStation Blog post. &quot;Congrats to everyone on a successful 2022... and here&#x27;s to next year being just as exciting as we continue to get Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 ready for release next fall.&quot; 
Not much else was revealed about this upcoming sequel, but PlayStation says, &quot;Following the events of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, the Spider-duo of Peter Parker and Miles Morales are back in the next blockbuster action chapter of the Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man series.&quot; 


The rest of the PlayStation Blog post details other upcoming titles, like Hogwarts Legacy, which had a gameplay showcase yesterday, Forspoken, which I previewed last week, and Final Fantasy XVI. Head there for additional details about these games and more. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man review and then check out our review of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Miles Morales.

They did so during the State of Unreal 2022 presentation, revealing that this Tomb Raider sequel – the fourth in this rebooted series – will be built on Unreal Engine 5. Now, Crystal Dynamics has announced that Amazon Games will publish this sequel.

                              <span>Two months ago, Studio MDHR announced a physical retail edition of its smash hit Cuphead. The charming trailer features physical puppets of Cuphead and his friends out on the high seas, searching for sunken treasure. What they find is news of a physical and collector&#x27;s edition of Cuphead. The cute trailer runs at just around a minute long, but the set and puppet designs are intricate, making you wonder just how much work went into creating the trailer.
Today, the studio released a behind-the-scenes look at how its retail partner iam8bit created the sets and puppets of that trailer. You can get a look at the team building and shooting it in the video below.

                              <span>A new PlayStation Blog post highlights six new PlayStation VR2 titles coming from various Japanese developers, including a sequel to the 2000 PlayStation 2 rhythm game, Fantavision. 
Other games announced include action game Altair Breaker, rhythm game Kizuna AI – Touch the Beat!, and more. We&#x27;ll break down what PlayStation has to say about each of these six new titles below. 
Fantavision 202X
Fantavision is a puzzle-rhythm game released on the PS2 in 2000 and it&#x27;s somewhat of a cult classic. The series has remained dormant since that original release, but developer Cosmo Machia Inc. is bringing it to this decade with a brand new sequel called Fantavision 202X.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village&#x27;s VR mode will hit PlayStation VR2 the day it launches, February 22, and it will be available as free DLC to anyone who owns Village on PlayStation 5. Those who own the Gold Edition of Village will get it for free, as well. 
You will need, however, the $549.99 PSVR2 hardware in order to check out this new mode for Village, as its name suggests. The VR mode isn&#x27;t just a slice of Village; you can play through the entire campaign in this new (probably horrifying) way. And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. 


&quot;A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters&#x27; journey takes full advantage of the headset&#x27;s advanced features,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.&quot;
Capcom says the platform&#x27;s PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. 
&quot;These [controllers] represent Ethan&#x27;s famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,&quot; Capcom writes in a press release. &quot;Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort. Weapons all feel tangibly more realistic in VR Mode with new gameplay elements that dial up the immersion, such as dual wielding and natural motion controls for reloading firearms and brandishing knives.&quot;

                              <span>Driller aka Space Station Oblivion (in the US), the FIRST supported game of the Freescape engine, is ready for public testing!
Published in 1987 by Incentive Software Limited, this revolutionary new engine allowed players to explore a solid 3D graphic environment with complete freedom of movement for the very first time in videogame history. 
A new threat emerges after humanity abandoned a dying Earth to establish a new home on planet Evath. Evath&#x27;s moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral&#x27;s 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.
Solve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!
Our reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

The reason is the company wants to, in its own words, “move to solely support Epic Online Services with its unified friends system, voice chat features, parental controls, and parental verification features.” 
Epic states that by January 24, the following titles no longer be playable online (albeit with some caveats, which are noted). Epic has also started removing these titles from digital storefronts and will disable DLC purchases. Most of these games can still be played offline if you own them. The list of affected games are:

                              <span>Mega Man, Lan, and the whole NT crew are making their return via the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection on April 4.


The bundle includes remastered ports of the 10 Game Boy Advance titles divided from the first six entries, such as:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
You can play these games solo or challenge other players in online matches. Legacy Collection even tosses in previously exclusive Battle Chips, such as those offered at Japanese promotional events. The collection also includes an optional high-resolution filter for each title, and museum features include over 1,000 pieces of artwork and nearly 200 music tracks. 
As an added bonus, Capcom announced plans to stream Seasons 1 and 2 of Mega Man NT Warrior, the anime that the Battle Network series is based on, on its Twitch channel early next year. The episodes will also be available to watch for free on Capcom’s YouTube page. 
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection will be available on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>In this special travel vlog, Game Informer&#x27;s Alex Van Aken and Brian Shea tour Super Nintendo World while visiting Osaka, Japan. The pair show off everything the park offers, including Peach&#x27;s Castle, Bowser&#x27;s Castle, Toad&#x27;s Cafe, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, and a final battle against Bowser Junior. Universal Studios&#x27; rendition of the Mushroom Kingdom is magical and easily the best theme park we&#x27;ve experienced.
Earlier this morning, Nintendo announced that the first Super Nintendo World U.S. location is opening in February 2023.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed earlier this year that it was developing new TV shows based on Gran Turismo, Horizon, and God of War. At the time, PlayStation Productions said the Horizon series was happening at Netflix (read some details about that here) and the God of War series was being handled by Amazon. That was it, though. 
Now, we know a little bit more about this God of War series, courtesy of Amazon Prime Video, as reported by Deadline. Amazon Prime Video has officially given a series order to God of War and as the name suggests, it will be based on the hit PlayStation franchise (which just received a sequel last month). More specifically, it will take place during the Norse era of Kratos&#x27; adventures, seemingly bypassing his more gruesome and violent Greek history. God of War (2018) directo…</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche Software and publisher Warner Bros. Games has released a new gameplay showcase to highlight three different aspects of its upcoming wizarding RPG: the open world, combat, and the famed castle&#x27;s Room of Requirement. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, with a recent delay pushing back the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to April 4 and the Switch version to July 25. Perhaps as a way to soothe the news of yesterday&#x27;s delay, or as a way to get players excited about February, four new looks at Hogwarts Legacy gameplay have been released, and you can watch all four below:

                              <span>The first Super Nintendo World in the US will finally open in February. 
More specifically, the opening day will be February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of a new trailer showcasing what to expect in the new park within Universal Studios Hollywood. There&#x27;s a look at Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge, Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure, the decor of the park, and of course, Mario and Luigi. It looks fantastic, as expected, given how great Super Nintendo World in Japan turned out to be (check out our photo slideshow from our recent visit to the park).
Check out Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s video announcing the Super Nintendo World release date below: 


As you can see, the park is looking great. We can&#x27;t wait to visit one day! Universal Studios Japan opened its Super Nintendo World last year and back in June, Universal revealed that Hollywood&#x27;s Nintendo-themed land would be opening in &quot;early 2023.&quot; Now we know the opening day is February 17, 2023, so get your travel dates in order if you plan on visiting this new park next year.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s-a go!
When we saw the early mockups for Super Nintendo World in Japan all those years ago, it all seemed to good to be true. Finally, everyone&#x27;s favorite mushroom eating, Goomba stomping, fireball throwing plumber would be coming to life in a substantial, tangible way, along with his friends and the world they inhabit. As something of a casual theme park enthusiast myself, I was also thrilled to see the state-of-the-art technology Universal would be incorporating to really bring the Mushroom Kingdom to life.
After the U.S. version of the park was announced earlier this year to be added as a new world to explore at Universal Hollywood, the western fans have been waiting patiently (or maybe not so patiently) for when it would finally be open. Thankfully, the wait is almost over, because this morning Universal Hollywood finally dropped the opening date for the park, and it&#x27;s right around the corner on February 17, 2023.

There&#x27;s gonna be a lot to look forward to at Super Nintendo World — the theming of the world is enough to make me want to go in the first place, but then there are the themed foods, the rides (Mario Kart: Koopa&#x27;s Challenge and Yoshi&#x27;s Adventure), the exclusive merch, and the character meetups with favorites like Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Sounds like a pretty incredible experience for anyone who is even the teensiest of a Mario fan, or even just theme park fans in general.
I actually just visited Universal Hollywood, and let me tell you, the excitement for Super Nintendo World was palpable. You can already see a good portion of the new addition from different vantage points in the park, and plenty of park-goers were already walking around with their new Mario-themed merch. A personal favorite of mine are the headbands that have little Boos on them, likely as a counter to Disney&#x27;s famous Mickey ear headbands.

It&#x27;s almost always difficult to dole out seasonal video game recommendations, and never is that challenge more apparent than now, at the beginning of the holiday season. We&#x27;re only a few days out from Hanukkah, which means the holidays are here in full force. But with so few festive video games in existence, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what, exactly, to play with hot cocoa in hand.
Luckily for you, I&#x27;ve got ten solid candidates for your playing pleasure over the next couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve tried my best to include something for everyone here, whether you&#x27;re home for the holidays or stuck someplace you&#x27;d rather not be.
Let me make two things clear: For one, I&#x27;m only focusing on games that are readily accessible in 2022. Wii Sports is obviously the best holiday game, but,…</span>

Breaking noses, chucking Hadokens, and staring at a dancing array of tweety birds is all well and good, but what is a World Warrior to do on their downtime? Capcom&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 aims to answer that question, offering a selection of mini-games to enjoy while your shoulder resets.
As glimpsed during last week&#x27;s pre-order trailer, Street Fighter 6&#x27;s single-player World Tour mode will see the player&#x27;s custom character wandering the Street Fighter universe — training with Luke, chowing down with Honda, and asking Juri if you can get together for a quality nail-painting session. And, as you progress on your path to street fighting enlightenment, you can boost your stats and skills via a selection of particularly silly activities.

Looks like Kratos is officially heading to streaming. Amazon Prime Video has put in an order for a God of War series, based on the popular games.
Deadline reported earlier this year that Amazon was in negotiations for a God of War adaptation, and now it looks like that&#x27;s bearing out. The God of War series will have Rafe Judkins from The Wheel of Time on as showrunner, with Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing.
Via Deadline&#x27;s writeup on the news, it sounds like the series will follow Kratos after he&#x27;s left the Greek pantheon behind and ventured to Midgard. PlayStation Productions will be teaming up with Amazon Prime Video to adapt the series, adding to the growing list of Sony&#x27;s adaptations.

Outside of streaming, God of War hasn&#x27;t been doing too shabby in the video game department either. The recently released Ragnarok just picked up a decent number of trophies at The Game Awards 2022, and it seems like the follow-up to 2018&#x27;s God of War has been a highlight of the year for Sony.

Many more adaptations to come
Sony is keeping the adaptations moving, though. The Last of Us is set to premiere next month on HBO. And the company has series in development for Horizon Zero Dawn and Twisted Metal too, with potentially more rumored to be on the way.
Really, there&#x27;s no shortage of video game adaptations on the way. Series like Arcane, The Witcher, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have all shown what kind of reach these adaptations can have. We&#x27;ll see just how they all pan out in the next few years.

                              <span>How many Switch consoles do you have at this point?
It was a very good year for the Switch. The console/portable hybrid skyrocketed in sales, landing squarely in the top five all-time listing: directly below the PS4 (though Nintendo is poised to beat that with their next earning&#x27;s report). Things are going well for Nintendo, but we also got a ton of great games in 2022.
Bayonetta 3 completely wowed me, and showed me what Platinum Games could really do all over again. Pokemon Legends reinvented the wheel in many respects with the aging Pokemon formula: and outshined a full-on generational release. Triangle Strategy and Kirby and the Forgotten Land reminded us all of the raw sticking power of SRPGs and Kirby respectively.
But Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one game I really need to shout out here in this post, as Monolith Soft deserves the credit. They&#x27;ve consistently been pumping out bangers for years, sometimes completely out of nowhere, and keep delivering. They&#x27;re one of the best studios Nintendo has ever hosted in its organization, and the team clearly gets what makes JRPGs special: including strong characterizations and worlds that are easy to get lost in.
It&#x27;s studios like Monolith Soft that help Nintendo secure Game of the Year nominees that are actual exclusives, year after year. Without further ado, here are Destructoid&#x27;s Switch nominees for 2022.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid&#x27;s Best Switch Game of 2022:
Bayonetta 3
Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope
Pokemon Legends: Arceus
Triangle Strategy
Kirby and the Forgotten Land
Splatoon 3
Xenoblade Chronicles 3

High on Life is finally out, and although I had some issues with it, I fully expect folks to vibe with Justin Roiland&#x27;s newest adventure. They&#x27;ll be vibing even more once they apply the day one patch, which fixes myriad problems with the base version of the game, from lock-out glitches to visual bugs.
Straight from a tweet from the official account, we have a laundry list of fixes and optimizations, as well as content updates. Speaking from experience, the general crash and progress blocker fixes are welcome: though in my time with the game, a &quot;checkpoint refresh&quot; was enough to clear them all out. The &quot;improved performance&quot; across all platforms should easily help with some of the visual jank therein, as well as some immersion-breaking stuff like co…</span>

While all four of the World Warriors debuted at last week&#x27;s Game Awards instilled excitement in the Street Fighter 6 community, perhaps no one character stole the show more than the Italian powerhouse Marisa, who turned more than a few heads with her gargantuan frame and devastating range of holds and strikes.
Born in Italy, Marisa says that her heritage can be traced back to the ancient warriors of Greece, a bloodline that she proudly emboldens with her stoic visage, incredible strength, and perhaps the most literal case of &quot;helmet hair&quot; that anybody has ever experienced. Marisa has a passion for both beauty and style, and as such works as a full-time jewelry designer, a delicate pastime juxtaposed against her indomitable power and towering 6&#x27;8 frame.

                              <span>Postal somehow keeps popping up to perpetually make these lists
It&#x27;s that time again! Metacritic has put out its list of the top 10 worst-rated games of the year, and you get to peruse them all to see which ones you&#x27;ve even heard of, much less have actually played.
Taking the number one spot is the always reliable Postal series, with Postal 4: No Regerts. I am absolutely amazed and dumfounded how Postal is still a thing in 2022, but here we are: I&#x27;m actually writing about it for the first time. They got me! In terms of &quot;games you&#x27;ve probably heard of,&quot; there&#x27;s CrossfireX on the list (which ranked second worst), as well as Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition, and Babylon&#x27;s Fall.
Sloppy ports and trash franchise tie-ins adorning this list makes sense. But Babylon&#x27;s Fall is arguably the biggest bust of 2022, as it was released by a major studio and publisher, and failed as a live service game very publicly. While the computations are solely based on platform-specific critical ratings, for me it would take the cake as the undisputed number one loser of the year for all of those aforementioned reasons.
It&#x27;s such a shame, because with more polish/development time, and the gumption to abandon the whole live service aspect and just make it a good game, it could have maybe had some sort of impact.
Here are 2022&#x27;s top worst ranked games on Metacritic (from worst to least worst)
Postal 4: No Regerts (PC)
CrossfireX (Xbox Series X)
Babylon&#x27;s Fall (PS5)
Xel (Switch)
LEGO Brawls (PS5)
Zorro: The Chronicles (PS4)
The Last Oricru (Xbox Series X)
The Waylanders (PC)
Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief (PS4)
Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition (Switch)

                              <span>I know when that hotline bling, it can only mean a new set of challenges has unlocked
After relenting for far too many years, the biggest releases on mobile in 2022 finally convinced me to get one of those Xbox controller attachments that hold your phone. After about five minutes of using it, I tossed it in the bin. The whole set-up was just too heavy and flimsy, even if it made playing games like Diablo Immortal and Apex Legends Mobile an absolute dream. No, if I&#x27;m going to get a controller for my mobile, I&#x27;m going to need to shell out the big bucks for one of those Backbones. And considering what&#x27;s on the horizon for next year, it&#x27;ll likely be worth it.
For this year though, I was perfectly happy playing through the best mobile games of the year with touchscreen controls. Whether I was digging up treasure in Shovel Knight Dig or scoring the winning goal in Rocket League Sideswipe–a game that was technically released in late November 2021 but wasn&#x27;t actually playable until a few days later in December so we&#x27;re counting it as eligible–touchscreen controls continue to evolve and improve with each passing year and each crop of new games.
Except for in Wordle where my fat fingers keep typing the wrong letters. Yes, we&#x27;re counting Wordle for this year&#x27;s GotY awards as well because while it might have started up last fall, nobody outside a small group of people was playing it until December.
We didn&#x27;t cover as many mobile games on Destructoid this year as we have in the past, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we weren&#x27;t playing them.
Here are the nominees for Destructoid&#x27;s Best Mobile Game of 2022:
Jetpack Joyride 2
Marvel Snap
Poinpy
Rocket League Sideswipe
Shovel Knight Dig
Slice &amp; Dice
Wordle

Epic is closing down servers for some of its older titles. Several classic Unreal titles, as well as some Harmonix games and other pieces of the Epic back catalog, are going offline.
The services are turning off so Epic can move to solely support its unified Epic Online Services, according to the company. While most of these games will remain available offline, some will be rendered no longer playable. &quot;We apologize to the players affected by these changes,&quot; Epic says in its update.
Games affected range from Epic&#x27;s classic titles, like Unreal, to some from studios it&#x27;s acquired over the years. A few Harmonix titles will see their online services turned off, though Dance Central VR and Rock Band 4 will stay live.

                              <span>We&#x27;re only a month away now
You&#x27;ve seen the memes, you&#x27;ve possibly played the demo: all there&#x27;s left to do is wait and see if Forspoken really is as middling as it seems.
Relatedly, Forspoken creative producer Raio Mitsuno recently came out and tried to throw some water on the fire, noting that the demo is not really representative of the full experience. Speaking to Gematsu, Mitsuno had this to say about the TGS demo build:
&quot;Just for some additional context, you said you played the Tokyo Game Show demo in October. So that was a specially crafted gameplay demo just to give a feel for the mechanics of parkour and magic. So that was specifically kind of fetch quest-like in terms of the makeup, like, do these five objectives and then you get to fight a boss. So the full game isn’t actually designed like that, that was just specifically created for that demo experience.&quot;

Honestly, the team probably would have been better off just not releasing this demo publicly at all, and coating on the visuals to sell the game. Crazily enough Forspoken is only a month-ish away, as it&#x27;s set to debut on January 24 on PC and PS5.
The backlash against the writing in particular has been fascinating, as the all-star duo of Amy Hennig and Gary Whitta have been targeted in particular by some folks. The reality is that Forspoken actually shares writing credits between five different people: and in an interview I attended earlier this year, Square Enix intimated that Hennig and Whitta only did a form of initial treatment on the story, subsequently handing off the bulk of the work to a greener team.
Forspoken&#x27;s writing is probably the thing I&#x27;m interested in the most, as I want to see if it sings beyond the quips we&#x27;ve seen so far. Well, as long as there&#x27;s a &quot;quip toggle,&quot; so I can survive that long.

In a little over a month from now, Persona fans will be afforded the opportunity to revisit two classic titles in the stylish JRPG franchise, as Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden make their long-awaited debut on PC and console platforms. Ahead of their respective releases, publisher Atlus has detailed a handful of new features coming to these epic tales of demons and dating.

By way of a new trailer, Capcom has confirmed that Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is out on April 14.
Amazingly, the extent of the collection&#x27;s online play has been revealed (Netbattle), with support for private and public matches. This is in addition to chip, style, and program trading (which will only be supported in Mega Man Battle Network 3 &quot;and beyond&quot;). As previously confirmed, the collection series will also have &quot;over 180 songs&quot; to listen to, as well as &quot;over 1,000 images&quot; to peruse in a gallery.
You can pre-order it now on PS4, PC (Steam) and Switch, via a $60 bundle that includes both collections (the physical version has &quot;one game card&quot; if you were wondering). Individual collections will be available &quot;separately at launch&quot; for $39.99 each. I…</span>

Following intense backlash from both viewers and streamers, Twitch has made the decision to remove the LGB Alliance from its Charity Tool feature.
The streaming service recently updated its approved charity list with &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of additional organizations, offering easier access for streamers to direct viewer payments to the PayPal-vetted charity of their choosing. However, many Twitch users were outraged at the addition of the UK-based LGB Alliance, an advocacy group founded in direct opposition to rights and support for transgender people.
The LGB Alliance was formed in 2019 after supporters of the LGBT rights group Stonewall denounced the latter&#x27;s inclusi…</span>

Square Enix, in association with developer Acquire, has released another character trailer for its dramatic adventure sequel Octopath Traveler II, once again introducing us to two more of the seemingly contrasting characters whose lives will nevertheless be thrust together by fate and circumstance.
We first meet Throne, or &quot;The Thief&quot;, a sultry young woman who is a member of the clandestine criminal organization &quot;The Blacksnakes&quot;, who control the city from the shadows. Despite her seemingly avaricious nature, Throne seems somewhat uneasy with her lot, though driven by her bloodline and destiny. Out on the battlefield, Throne is able to steal from the townspeople, as well as ambush guards and enemies for a stealthier approach to hazardous situations. Her Latent Power (Li…</span>

                              <span>Earlier today we brought news that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s next-gen update – a seemingly juicy serving of new ray tracing, DLSS/FSR upscaling, and assorted quality of life features – had in fact arrived in a bit of a mess. To assess the damage, I’ve spent some time with it myself, and can confirm: it ain’t great! Besides the devastating frames-per-second toll that the RT effects take, it seems far more crash-prone than I ever remember The Witcher 3 being in the past, and performance in general is just worse than it was pre-update.

                              <span>Yee haw, buckle up, root and also toot, for the Devil&#x27;s Moon event has kicked off in Hunt Showdown. The event sees Crytek&#x27;s excellent multiplayer cowboy sneak &#x27;em up periodically set fire to big parts of each map, where you blow up creepy bleedy statues for points that unlock new weapons and traits. There&#x27;s one that makes you invisible to monsters, which sounds ridiculously powerful - which is probably why the traits will only be in play until the event ends on January 15th.

Patch 9 for Baldur&#x27;s Gate III is out now, adding playable Paladins and increasing the level cap to 5. In true D&amp;D spirit, that&#x27;s when you get the good stuff, like the ability to fly or summon zombies. Heck, I think you can summon zombies and make *them* fly. It&#x27;s a whole new world.
Come watch the developers natter all about it in a festive edition of one of their Panels From Hell. One of them is dressed up as a knitting reindeer, and they just announced critical role chap Matthew Mercer will voice a new character.

                              <span>Devil Daggers was fantastic, Hyper Demon is better. The sequel to Sorath&#x27;s exquisite wave survival FPS flips a slow-building, protracted struggle into a hyperdense spurt of action that escalates in lockstep with your abilities, thanks to enemies that spawn the moment you&#x27;ve dispatched their chums and a score that ticks down with every second you spend not actively murdering. 


That structure is also a trap. It’s an invitation to devise an opening dance that dispatches those first few waves as quickly as possible, yet following that dance too rigidly will crash you headfirst into a bonespire. Hyper Demon screams at you to go fast - though when I asked programmer Matt Bush for tips, he suggested I slow down.

                              <span>It&#x27;s quite sad that one of The Geoff Awards 2022 announcements I&#x27;m most excited about likely targeted me and no-one else. And that&#x27;s because it 1) was a reminder, not an announcement; 2) was something to do with Call Of Duty; 3) didn&#x27;t show off a great deal. Yep, it was the reminder that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting its first raid very soon.
BUT, I&#x27;d argue that it should - even just a teeny weeny bit – be of interest to you. Finally, a raid is coming to a game that isn&#x27;t a life investment, and that&#x27;s rad.

                              <span>Earlier this year I watched a very short presentation of Inkbound, an upcoming turn-based roguelike from Shiny Shoe, the devs behind deckbuilder Monster Train. I thought it had potential, but it&#x27;s difficult to determine just how much potential something has when all you&#x27;ve got to go on is footage they&#x27;d prepared earlier, like a cottage pie from a Sunday Brunch oven.
I&#x27;m excited to report that I spent over an hour with the game alongside Shiny Shoe&#x27;s CEO Mark Cooke and creative director Andrew Krausnick, who were not only lovely but put up with my incredible ability to fumble my turns. Still, I was impressed by how the game&#x27;s speedy combat matched its roguelike needs, as it pushed us through even the trickiest of scenarios - as opposed to other strategy games which can feel like trudging through a sea of glue.

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is not for the squeamish. Fatshark’s spiritual follow-up to Vermintide and Vermintide 2 is ferocious, violent, and involves a whole lotta gore. It’s a grisly co-op multiplayer where instead of brawling your way through torrents of gross rat humanoids, you and your rag-tag team are now up against hordes of scabby zombies all in favour of a Imperial fascist overlord.
Several of the RPS Treehouse folk have jumped into the fray, carving their way through Darktide’s industrial world of Gothic factories and towering cathedrals. The verdict? Uninspiring progression systems and short, repetitive missions aside, Darktide still remains a bone-crunching gorefest best enjoyed with pals. Preferably ones with strong stomachs.
James: I was actually braced to bounce off this, in the same way I bounced off Vermintide 2 and its monotonously melee-focused ratman slaughter. Nope – I’m 22 hours in and not even close to abandoning interest in my greasy crew of Imperial screwups. I think it might be because Darktide strikes a finer balance of slicing and shooting? Like there’s more of a dynamism to horde fights when you’re switching between the two. It rarely feels like I’m just swing, swing, swinging, unless I have a new Power Sword I want to try out.

                              <span>Aquatic open-world sci-fi fest Subnautica has hit 2.0 with its Living Large major update, bringing the game&#x27;s quality up to par with sequel Subnautica: Below Zero. The update brings across some snazzy construction parts from Below Zero, meaning you’re now free to trick out your bases with surface hatches and glass domes. Nice. It also sweeps away more than 800 bugs, including ones that affected base building, vehicle navigation, and piloting. Living Large adds an unstuck button to the menu too, in case you get into peril on some geometry below the waves and can’t free yourself.

                              <span>Earlier today, it was revealed that Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion has a piece of artwork in it with a great big Getty Images watermark slapped across it. The eagle-eyed staff over at Kotaku posted an image of the offending painting, found in Nibelheim&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion where Zack and co find themselves toward the end of the game, and having gone back in to see for myself, I can confirm that, yep, the in-game painting of John Crowther&#x27;s Ludgate Circus, London, 1881 does indeed still have the watermark on it. Oops! Might want to sort that licence fee, Square Enix, or at least patch it out before Getty starts a&#x27;knockin... 
Whoopsie artwork isn&#x27;t the only thing hiding in Crisis Core&#x27;s ShinRa Mansion, though, because down in the basement is a rather cute nod a Final Fantasy VII fav. Spoilers within, obvs.

The 7.2: Showdown On Ruhnuk update to saber-swinging MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic has you hunting down a rogue member of that pesky warrior clan, landing/crashing you on a new planet with fresh daily missions and a story questline. There&#x27;s a big PvP revamp, too, along with substantial changes to how gear works.
Planet Ruhnuk is the beigest entity I&#x27;ve ever seen, but you&#x27;re not there for your holidays, are you.

                              <span>We’re just a few weeks off living in the futuristic year of 2023, so it’s entirely unsurprising that the world’s (former) richest man just dropped the whole of Steam’s catalogue as a form of in-car entertainment. Elon Musk shared his company Tesla’s announcement, via his company Twitter, that not his company Steam was now supported in Tesla’s newest Model S and X vehicles. Do you remember when I-spy was the height of gaming in a car? Well, now you can pretty much play whatever game you like instead with the Tesla holiday update. You can use a controller, but it supports mouse and keyboard wirelessly for that authentic roadside PC experience.

                              <span>Today is the day The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s much touted free next-gen update arrives on PC and consoles, but it’s not been going so well for a lot of us folk on PC. People have already taken to Twitter, Reddit, and Steam with their tales of performance woe since the update landed, with Steam reviews claiming it&#x27;s caused everything from reduced frame rates to issues with the HUD. The RPS Treehouse has also been having trouble since installing the 4.0 update too, getting very inconsistent frame rates on the new max settings even with a RTX 3080 unless they turn off ray tracing and other new graphical features. Hardware editor James and vid bud Liam have more on The Witcher 3&#x27;s performance woes here, but for now, here&#x27;s how to avoid having the next-gen update ruin your Witcher 3 experience, and keep Roach running nice and smoothly.

                              <span>The WD Black SN770 is a rather lovely PCIe 4.0 SSD, offering sequential speeds up to 5150MB/s at a surprisingly low price. The drive was dubbed &#x27;just short of SSD greatness&#x27; on its debut earlier this year, but price drops have brought it increasingly into contention. 
Today, for example, you can pick up the 1TB model from WD&#x27;s official UK web store for £75, down from £91, or the larger 2TB size for £140, down from £181. That beats the Amazon price considerably, especially for the 2TB size which is currently at £178.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a big fan of mechanical keyboards, so when I saw this unusual keyboard discounted on Amazon, I needed to write it up for RPS. The idea here is that it&#x27;s more or less a 60% size mechanical keyboard, but with two useful additions: arrow keys and a numpad. This makes it about the same size as a tenkeyless keyboard, but without the (lesser-used) navigation keys. 
Combined with an asking price of £42, down from a usual price of £50, I think it&#x27;s well worth considering - whether you&#x27;re looking for an interesting mechanical keyboard for your growing collection (I see you there) or a first cheap mech to give the whole idea a try.

                              <span>Games get delayed so often that it&#x27;s always a pleasure when a release date is instead moved earlier. Chop Goblins maybe takes it to an extra extreme. The 30-minute retro shooter from the developer of Dusk was due for release on January 2nd, but it&#x27;s out now after being released several weeks earlier. &quot;I was bored,&quot; explained the developer on Twitter.

                              <span>When Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII first came out in 2007 as part of Square Enix&#x27;s somewhat indulgent (and merely so-so) FF7 Compilation project, it was intended to fill in the backstory of one of the main game&#x27;s most mysterious and spoilerific character twists. Namely that FF7 hero and perpetual mopey boy Cloud Strife wasn&#x27;t quite who he thought he was, and that he actually owes a lot of his life (literally and figuratively) to the peppy, squat-loving ShinRa go-getter Zack Fair. (And if you&#x27;re mad about me spoiling that 25-year-old story beat, wait until you see what they&#x27;ve done with FF7 Remake).
It&#x27;s with FF7 Remake in mind, though, that many of you will probably be wondering where this swanky new remaster of FF7&#x27;s PSP prequel fits into the increasingly up for grabs timeline of Squeenix&#x27;s ongoing Remake trilogy. And just as the original Crisis Core was almost impossible to talk about without entering major spoiler territory for the main game of Final Fantasy VII, so it goes for Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion. For the spoiler-averse, I&#x27;ll say this. If you don&#x27;t already know the backstory of Zack and his relationship with arch mega villain Sephiroth, this is a perfectly fine action game that&#x27;s received a lot of welcome polish for a 15-year old PSP title, but is probably still best experienced through a comprehensive YouTube retrospective as opposed to forking out £40 / $50 for it. For everyone else out there, though, let&#x27;s get into it.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 struggled to quickly apply fixes for issues with its heroes during Season 1, but Blizzard say they’ve managed to sort all that out for the recently minted hero shooter. A hotfixing tool that was used for the first time today means there shouldn’t be any need for more weeks-long absences such as Bastion and Mei’s in Season 1. According to a Twitter thread by Overwatch 2’s commercial lead Jon Spector, the hotfix tool also lets Blizzard apply hero rebalances much more quickly. It doesn’t all sound like plain sailing, though.

They say Christmas is a season for cheer and goodwill towards all but that&#x27;s not an observation, it&#x27;s an imploration. Christmas can be difficult for so many reasons, and that is why we must offer people cheer and goodwill. So truly, genuinely I find great comfort and joy in Christmas Pain In Christmas Town, a novelty Christmas song by a fictional washed-up musician from 90s infobahn detective game Hypnospace Outlaw. May this music video bring you cheer too.

That Lonesome Valley lets you play out the relationship between two young herders working alone together out in the American wilderness. Yang gives a content warning for the game, which contains pixel art nudity and sex sequences. You can watch the first ten minutes of That Lonesome Valley below.

                              <span>The strategic superheroics of Marvel’s Midnight Suns might make it a Bestest Bests winner, but tragically, it does come yoked to the dreadful 2K Launcher. A few months breaking the BioShock series on the Steam Deck, this pernicious piece of software now appears to be a major cause of Midnight Suns&#x27; stuttering issues, while seriously hobbling performance more generally. 


If you&#x27;re playing via Steam, I strongly suggest following the lead of the, uh, thousands of people who’ve discovered this before me by disabling the 2K Launcher entirely. I’ve just tried this out and not only did the majority of the stuttering vanish, but my average frames per second shot up by nearly 62%. 62% better performance! From nixing a launcher that serves absolutely no purpose when you’re launching from Steam anyway! Madness.

                              <span>When I heard timebending roguelike shooter Returnal was actually, really, definitely coming to PC during The Game Awards last week, I wasn’t quite expecting the recommended system requirements to suggest I set aside 32GB RAM at its disposal.

That&#x27;s a nice $69 reduction from its MSRP and an excellent value for a drive of this size and spec.

This model debuted at $300, but is now available for just $190 when you buy it from Antonline on Ebay.

                              <span>High on Life, a game where you use talking guns to stop humans from being sold as drugs, is the newest title from Squanch Games, a development studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, When I played their last game, Trover Saves the Universe, a few years ago, I was surprised by how naturally Roiland’s brand of improvised dialogue translated to video game form. Characters would ramble on as long as you stuck around to listen, and I would find myself standing in certain spots for upwards of five or six minutes, just listening to Roiland (who voiced many characters, Trover included) riff on one joke over and over again. While High on Life and Trover are two very different games, Roiland’s style of comedy is featured heavily in both. When I got a chance to talk to Roiland (an…</span>

                              <span>The Switch and last-gen versions of Hogwarts Legacy have been delayed. The game is still slated to release on February 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, everyone else will have to wait a few more months. 
The open-world Wizarding World adventure now has two additional release dates. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions launch on April 4. The Switch port comes a few months later, on July 25. Developer Avalanche says it decided to stagger the release to ensure the best possible experience on each platform. 
Hogwarts Legacy will launch on April 4, 2023 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on July 25, 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The team is looking forward to bringing you the game and we want to deliver the best possible game experience across all platforms.
December 13, 2022
Additionally, a game FAQ about the change in dates clarifies that the PS4/XB1 Deluxe Editions will not include the 72-hour early access that the current-gen and PC bundle is receiving.

                              <span>Platinum Games vice president Hideki Kamiya doesn&#x27;t see the Bayonetta series ever ending. 
He told IGN Japan this during a new interview, which touches on the creator&#x27;s post-Bayonetta 3 thoughts, possible spin-off games, and a brand new game with the codename Project G.G. When asked if there&#x27;s a chance players get a Bayonetta 4 or even a Bayonetta 5, Kamiya said he wants to make both of those games. 


&quot;I personally can&#x27;t conceive the Bayonetta series ever ending,&quot; Kamiya told IGN Japan. &quot;I want to make a Bayonetta 4 and Bayonetta 5, and I intend on pitching them to the company.&quot;
Kamiya goes further, revealing that the team often talks &quot;internally about how we could make nine of them.&quot; He also said he wants people to believe him when he says, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to do anything that will betray the players.&quot; 
While not official announcements, it seems players hoping for a Bayonetta 4, 5, or even Bayonetta 9 are in luck if Kamiya remains at Platinum Games. While waiting for additional Bayonetta sequels, read about the upcoming spin-off, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, and then read Game Informer&#x27;s Bayonetta 3 review.

Since its inception nearly three decades ago, Need for Speed’s best entries have combined style and substance to produce thrilling homages to the street racing scene. Need for Speed Unbound feels like the ultimate realization of that philosophy, creating one of the franchise’s best in years.
Sliding into the driver seat of the nearly 150 cars in Need for Speed Unbound feels terrific. Blasting down a straightaway in a McLaren delivers a remarkable sense of speed but nailing a corner drift in a Mitsubishi feels just as good.…</span>

                              <span>Back in 2020 the Linux kernel added a split-lock detector since when they occur an atomic instruction spanning multiple cache lines and requiring a global bus lock is needed. This has an unfortunate heavy impact on the system and thus the detector was added to report it to the kernel log when a split-lock occurs. But earlier this year starting with Linux 5.19, kernel developers decided to &quot;make life miserable&quot; and intentionally slow down bad behaving apps that abuse split-locks. That in turn has caused problems for some games -- so far select Windows games running under Steam Play -- and thus a new kernel knob is being added to more easily adjust the behavior...</span>

                              <span>Playing online card battlers can be a lonely life, so I was pleased to spot Marvel Snap&#x27;s latest community infographic. No longer are my opponents just names on a screen: they&#x27;re now names on a screen who I know have contributed to the 159 million Vibranium cards drawn during the Vibranium Forge event. It&#x27;s neat to see some silly stats, even neater to see a Black Panther with a power level that tops 8 million. A normal number would be, like, 16.

                              <span>You might have missed it in the Games Awards news-glut, but FromSoftware announced a new game last week. Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon marks the return of the mechs they used to make before Demon&#x27;s Souls set them on a different, swordier path, and IGN have just published a big interview that pokes into what bearing the Soulsbourne lineage might have on a game about flying mechs with guns and missiles. 
Armored Core director (and Sekiro lead designer) Masaru Yamamura welcomed Sekiro comparisons, while FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was keen to stress they&#x27;re treating it as an Armored Core game rather than a Soulsborne game.

A limited-time mode introduced with Season 01 Reloaded&#x27;s launch on Wednesday will see two teams of three knocking a big football about on ATVs equipped with special pulse abilities, in classic Rocket League fashion. 
The developers are also bringing back Mini Royale, popping up a new building in the DMZ mode, and adding a new map to the multiplayer mode that you actually need to own Modern Warfare 2 for.

He also mentioned he plans to &quot;create even more interesting games&quot;, if a triumph like Elden Ring still isn&#x27;t good enough for you.

                              <span>Synced is an upcoming free to play third-person looter shooter developed by NeXT Studios, and is Tencent&#x27;s crack at a live-service game akin to The Division. It has roguelite bits to help it stand out a touch, with the ability to command your own shiny gem pal to bash enemies. But from what I&#x27;ve played so far, its lack of clarity makes its grind for currencies and mod slots and whatever else a tired affair that probably won&#x27;t pull you away from the bazillion other games that require a lifetime investment.

                              <span>The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX hark back to a simpler time – about three months ago – when graphics cards resembled graphics cards and not Coca-Cola lorries. I like getting a bajillion frames per second as much as the next PC owner, but good gravy, are the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 a pair of oversized, ruinously expensive brutes.

When it’s Unciv, a free to play, open-source reimagining of Sid Meier’s Civilization V that’s being developed by volunteers on GitHub. After nearly three years in development and releases on Android, Linux, and through itch.io, Unciv’s now moving its units onto Steam. You&#x27;ll be able to play multiplayer Unciv, but that involves using Dropbox for syncing, which isn’t free to use.

You can still unlock 70 of the things via Ubisoft Connect, which launches automatically when you boot the game up on Steam anyway - so the only functional difference is that your achievements won&#x27;t all be in the same place. People don&#x27;t love that, which is fair, but let&#x27;s keep our heads now.

CTV News report that parents of three Canadian children who regularly play Fortnite claim the game was created to be “highly addictive”, and allege the battle royale has caused their kids psychological and physical problems, along with financial issues. Although the families are seeking damages from Epic, no figure has been put on those yet. Epic has 30 days to appeal the case or it’ll go to trial.

Grindheim posted a video to YouTube and Twitter that alleged the publisher’s recent business practices towards the game haven’t been “ethically correct”. Digerati later shared their own video response on Twitter, with owner Sarah Alfieri saying Digerati have been “blindsided” by Grindheim’s statement.

                              <span>Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as the two discuss all things One Piece Odyssey, an upcoming One Piece JRPG based on the hit anime and manga series. 
Wesley recently went hands-on with the game for a couple of hours, exploring One Piece Odyssey&#x27;s first two chapters, and he had a blast. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, the two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, its combat and what it&#x27;s doing different in the JRPG genre, and why One Piece makes for such a fun world to play around in. Enjoy!


As you can see, One Piece Odyssey is shaping up to be a great time, especially for pirates. While we only got to experience the game&#x27;s opening hours, we&#x27;re excited about the full release in January. In the meantime, read Wesley&#x27;s full thoughts on this preview here. 
One Piece Odyssey hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 12.

                              <span>We are pleased to announce that ScummVM now supports Adibou 2, a popular educational game developed by Coktel Vision in 1996.
Designed for children from 4 to 7 years old, the world of Adibou is warm and full of surprises. It offers an intelligent and appealing introduction to essential knowledge like reading and math.
Whether you have young kids in your family, or are keen on reliving your childhood memories for a while, fetch the latest daily build of ScummVM, your own copy of Adibou 2, and start learning having fun with Adibou, Plop, Robitoc and Kicook!
You must copy the content of your Adibou “Environment” CD into the game directory added to ScummVM. Then, for any Adibou Application you want to add, just copy the content of their CD into a freely named subdirectory of the main game directory.
Only Read/Count 4-5 years, Read/Count 6-7 years applications are supported for now, but we hope Science, Music and English will come soon.
Currently ScummVM is aware of several Adibou versions in French, German and English, let us know if you own any language/version not yet registered. Please also report to the issue tracker any glitch you may encounter.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has announced several changes coming to the Pokémon Trading Card Game, starting with the first expansion in the Scarlet and Violet series hitting in March. In addition to the ex gameplay mechanic that was announced for the series in August at the Pokémon World Championships, players can expect several changes to the cards and the packs in which they are housed.
First up, those yellow borders U.S. players and collectors are so used to will become a thing of the past. Starting with Scarlet and Violet, the borders will be gray to match the Japanese cards. The move is said to provide a more seamless experience for the Pokémon Trading Card Game while putting a greater emphasis on the actual artwork of the cards. Additionally, Trainer cards will now have subcategories display…</span>

                              <span>Amazon Basics have produced some great computer gear in their history - memorably, once selling a full-size mechanical keyboard for £23 that I reviewed and found surprisingly good value for money. Today though, it&#x27;s something different: an Amazon Basics branded Micro SD card in a 256GB capacity, selling for just £15.67 rather than its UK RRP of £26.99. 
Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned about the card, and why I reckon it&#x27;s worth picking up if you&#x27;re in need for a memory card for your Steam Deck, Switch or whatever.

                              <span>Logitech&#x27;s MX Master line of office-friendly, gaming-capable mice are normally quite premium propositions. However, today on Amazon UK the recent MX Master 2S is on sale for only £40, around a £25 reduction from its usual price point. This is a good deal for a mouse loved for its high-tech scroll wheel, wide and comfortable shape and long-ass battery life.

                              <span>Some men just want to watch the world burn, and that includes me. The Devil&#x27;s Moon event for excellent cowboy swamp simulator Hunt Showdown kicks off on December 14th, no doubt sending players off to squish environmental objects for points that unlock new weapons and cosmetics in the manner of previous events. This one is different, though, in that it also introduces a &quot;wildcard condition&quot; called Inferno that sets large swathes of the map on fire. It is dramatic. Come see.

                              <span>Your wallet may still be quivering from the Steam Autumn Sale. Tough. It&#x27;s time to grab hold of it again, comfort it with a few tender strokes, then gorge on its innards to pay for some of the splendid turn-based strategy games on sale in Steam&#x27;s TurnBasedFest.
There are decent discounts for Katharine&#x27;s beloved Dorfromantik, my beloved Slipways, and many generally beloved digified board games. Most of the sales end on December 12th, so don&#x27;t spend too long thinking about it. Reality&#x27;s turn-timers aren&#x27;t optional.

                              <span>The impact of the 2D Fallouts still reverberates, and the latest result of that is Space Wreck, an isometric RPG with a huge emphasis on screwing up.
Okay, maybe that&#x27;s just my bad decisions talking. You&#x27;re stranded on a wrecked space station after a failed pirate attack, and must get back to your ship. It&#x27;s not super secret, but I almost don&#x27;t want to say more than that, because this is a game overflowing with possibilities in a way that even Fallout seldom matched. It is not quite ready, but if the bugs can be ironed out, and perhaps more crucially, the save system reorganised, this could easily become one of the best RPGs of its kind.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t on call last night, so I didn&#x27;t get to experience The Geoffies in their full, live glory, as God intended. But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because we&#x27;ve done our own awards, and who needs a live show with a smiley man in clean, clean trainers when you&#x27;ve got a list of the games and things in games that we liked for reasons too specific to get a category on stage? Also, none of them are Elden Ring.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t been active in fandom spaces for years now, but lurking on the edges of social media forums dedicated to games I find cool does technically fall under the remit of my job. And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they&#x27;re bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.
I genuinely daren&#x27;t check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn&#x27;t a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don&#x27;t think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I&#x27;ll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.

                              <span>A lot of people claim foisting modern graphics on older games just results in compromising the original&#x27;s artistic vision. I am a chump who likes shiny things, so the release of Portal with RTX on Steam pleases me. It&#x27;s free if you own Portal, but fellow chumps should be aware that it&#x27;s not running too hot for everyone, with reports of crashes and literally too-hot GPUs. Ray-tracing does not come cheap.

                              <span>What first comes to mind when you think of Fallout 76? The buggy launch in 2018? A big wasteland to hang out with your mates? How about the fan-made art galleries available in-game? Well, if that’s not wacky enough, meet The Wasteland Theatre Company, a collective of players who have organised, directed and performed a series of live shows in Fallout 76. Back in April, the company produced a version of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet in-game using a stage they built themselves. In the spirit of the holidays, the group reconvened to tackle another literary classic: Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, benefitting a children&#x27;s hospital.

Not so for Barney Calhoun, who fought his way free of the facility back in Valve&#x27;s 2001 Half-Life expansion, Blue Shift. Modding team HECU Collective have been forcing him to run that gauntlet again, so far releasing 3 chapters to their mod for Black Mesa - not the fictional company, but the very real (and good) fan remake of the original Half-Life.
Chapter 4: Captive Freight comes out tomorrow, so it&#x27;s a fine time to jump in.

Though the TGAs proper were full of big games, names, and announcements, the indie showcase was no slouch, highlighting over a dozen exciting indies. One of the most notable was Spirittea, a life-sim where you manage a bathhouse, build relationships with the local NPCs and help various spirits that only you can see. Sort of a Spirited Away meets Stardew Valley proposition.

                              <span>Earlier this year I compared the MMO Lost Ark to grey carpet, in the sense that the MMO Lost Ark is exactly like a grey carpet: trendy yet drab. At the time I&#x27;d been in the market for a new – and entirely necessary - underfoot experience, so I turned to a local Carpet Man to procure said plush. In the end he seemed pleased that I rebelled against the majority and opted for a sunny corn colour.
But the latest Armored Core VI trailer from this year&#x27;s Geoff Awards had me in a contemplative mood. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, I thought, &quot;Carpet Man would appreciate FromSoftware&#x27;s use of grey&quot;. Even though there isn&#x27;t a fuzzy floor surface to be seen, could the trailer have triggered grey&#x27;s redemption arc?

Not to the extent that I will ever bother to learn anything about them, or to identify one with any more specificity than “the pointy type”, “the blunt type” and “the chugga chugga choo choo all-aboard type”, but to the far milder extent that I simply enjoy watching them whizz around the place like big metal worms, and hearing their various little noises and honks. It’s trains! 
Just as a train might be lured into a station with the promise of fresh passengers (which are like treats to trains), I have been drawn inexorably toward Choo-Choo Charles, a ramshackle joke-game about a scary train that chases you around. Marooned on a perpetually dark island, you’re stalked by a monstrous locomotive with a set of great big spider legs and an unquenchable thirst for human blood.

                              <span>In the same way that shoulderpads sometimes become cool again, and everyone is buying over-sized hair scrunchies like wot I used to have when I was 11, games journalists are destined to be trapped in repeating discourse cycles of ever-decreasing size. This is why I will often specifically advise people to never, ever pitch me opinions about BioShock. Any opinions about BioShock have already been had. There are no more opinions to have about it.

My state of peace in this area was just scuppered by that utter bastard Ken Levine, the creative director and writing lead on both BioShock and BioShock Infinite, when he revealed some of the new game by his studio Ghost Story Games (aka The Developers Formerly Known As Irrational). As observed by everyone who saw the reveal at The Game Awards last night, Judas is basically BioShock in space. The bad news is that this will put more fuel in Thomas The Take Engine, but the good news is that, if it is indeed like BioShock, we can save ourselves a lot of time. When Judas comes out please just return to this article and insert a specific title and delete options as applicable.

                              <span>Last night at The Game Awards, we learned that not only will there be a Hades 2, but it will be making the absolutely correct choice of letting Zagreus step aside to make way for a new protagonist. This time around we&#x27;ll be playing as Melinoë, modelled after the Greek goddess of nightmares and madness. She&#x27;s also Zag&#x27;s half-sister — yet another of the dozens of children, step-children, and foster-children of Hades knocking about the place — which brings me to my main take-away from the newly-confirmed existence of a Hades sequel: the title character is a really bad dad.

                              <span>Last night at The Game Awards, Raw Fury and developers Red Soul Games released a new look at the indie horror Post Trauma. The paranormal game leans heavily into the PSX generation of survival horrors, with its fixed camera angles and even optional tank controls. The developers describe it as &quot;both a tribute and a modern take on classic horror games.&quot;

                              <span>Soulslike RPG The Lords Of The Fallen debuted its first gameplay trailer last night at The Game Awards, showcasing its violent combat, grotesque creature designs, and beautifully grim setting. The Lords Of The Fallen was previously announced as a reboot to the 2014 game of almost the same name (they added a The this time), although it now seems to be a sort-of sequel. Judging from this trailer the devs would be quite happy if someone thought it was Dark Souls 4 by mistake.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Game Awards, we got to see a short teaser trailer for the latest game to come under EA&#x27;s Originals label. It&#x27;s called Immortals of Aveum, and it&#x27;s being made by the recently-formed Ascendant Studios - which you might remember is Dead Space creative director Bret Robbins&#x27; new thing. Details about the first-person magic shoot &#x27;em up are slim, but the trailer shows off some flashy magical spells and a fantasy city in crisis. You can watch the teaser reveal below.

Good job you’re around to give it a jolly good thwacking in action-survival game Remnant 2, a sequel to Remnant: From The Ashes announced during The Game Awards tonight. Your do-gooder can play solo or team up to sort out some pretty unpleasant monstrosities with up to two pals. Have a glance at the trailer below to see some very creepy beasties, and hear someone absolutely wail on their axe.

                              <span>For the longest time, FromSoftware were best known for their Armored Core series of middling mech games. Then they found a whole new audience with Demon&#x27;s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, and nary a big robot in sight. Well, now FromSoft are returning to big stompy boys with Armored Core VI: Fires Of Rubicon, coming in 2023. Check out the cool mechs in the announcement trailer from tonight&#x27;s Geoffries, below.

                              <span>Final Fantasy 16 got a fiery new trailer tonight, as well as a final release date of June 22nd 2023. At least that&#x27;s the date for PS5 players. For us folks on PC, tonight&#x27;s Game Awards trailer confirmed in tiny small print that Square Enix&#x27;s next JRPG epic won&#x27;t be landing on &quot;other platforms&quot; until December 31st 2023 at the earliest. So, unless Squeenix are going to deliver us a belated Christmas New Year special next year, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that FF16&#x27;s PC release won&#x27;t be available to summon until 2024. Still, based on what we&#x27;ve seen in its new &quot;Revenge&quot; trailer tonight, I reckon it will be well worth the wait.

This is a wholly new IP from the studio, who you might know as the creators behind survival horror slasher, Dead By Daylight.

                              <span>Right, here’s where I have to stay objective and professional. I’ve been a card-carrying Transformers fan since Generation 1, so I’m somewhat confused by the trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight for Gears studio Splash Damage’s upcoming co-op action game Transformers: Reactivate. Yes, theoretically any rather large robot that changes shape counts as a Transformer. Possibly a GoBot, I’m not going to judge anyone on their lifestyle. Just watch the trailer below and tell me what you think, go on.

                              <span>Man, I was never much of a Flash liker, but even I feel a bit sorry for him in tonight&#x27;s new trailer for Rocksteady&#x27;s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. He gets a right old beating in the new Game Awards footage, but thankfully it looks like The Batman will be on hand to deliver some much needed... justice (sorry) when it comes out on May 26th 2023. Maybe. Miss you, Kevin Conroy.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of a report claiming that Diablo IV developers are likely facing painful overtime to meet a then-unconfirmed release date of June 6th, a new trailer at the Geoffries tonight confirmed that yeah Diablo IV&#x27;s release date is June 6th. Well. Alrighty. Still, this CGI trailer is nice and fancy.

                              <span>I was astonished by the announcement of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at last year&#x27;s Game Awards, never expecting a sequel to actually happen, so I&#x27;m pleased to see a new trailer at this year&#x27;s Geoffries. This &quot;gameplay reveal trailer&quot; only has a few wee snippets of the game being played, but they&#x27;re solid. As our boy Spice Maureen stomps through vast Gothic industrial ruins and cuts through hordes of aliens, it&#x27;s got that &#x27;Dynasty Warriors meets God Of War&#x27; look again. But I do already miss the Orks.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t Nod are still primarily associated with Life Is Strange and a handful of other narrative-focused adventure games. Back in 2018, however, they also made action RPG Vampyr, which mixed more substantial combat among their usual focus on story. 

It&#x27;s in this vein that Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden seems to continue. It&#x27;s an action RPG about &quot;two proficient ghost hunters and lovers&quot; set in the haunted, frozen wilderness of 1695 North America. You can watch the reveal trailer below.

Earthblade is a high-fantasy exploration game that takes place in a ruined world with magic and monsters. It looks pretty cool, so check out the trailer below.

The exact timing of the Company Of Heroes 3 Console Edition is yet to be confirmed, but it will mark the first time Relic&#x27;s historical real-time strategy game will be available to play outside of PC. However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game&#x27;s multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have &quot;no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch&quot;.

                              <span>Anime is a Good Thing. There, I said it. Those cel-shaded visuals instantly got my attention when the new trailer for free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol popped up at The Game Awards this evening - and that Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack ain&#x27;t bad either (that&#x27;s one for the Gundam Unicorn and Attack On Titan fans out there). It&#x27;s being developed by Bandai Namco, but for some reason New World and Lost Ark publisher Amazon Games will be the ones bringing the MMO to the west in the second half of 2023. Either way, you can watch the trailer below and repeat my own very succinct inner monologue, if you like. Repeat after me: “Ooh, cel-shading. Nice.”

                              <span>Russia has sent a record number of takedown requests to Google in the first half of this year. In the past, copyright infringement was the most cited reason for action but that has been replaced by &#x27;national security&#x27;, currently a top priority for Russia. Google, however, is wary of overbroad censorship and hasn&#x27;t complied with most requests.

                              <span>Italy&#x27;s campaign against pirate IPTV will receive a big boost if new amendments are signed into law. ISPs must aim to block unlicensed streams immediately but certainly within 30 minutes. The proposal was signed by Senator Claudio Lotito, who happens to own top-tier football club Lazio and is currently the vice-president of Italy&#x27;s Budget Commission.

                              <span>We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
In 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that&#x27;s (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.

                              <span>The Game Awards have come and gone, and on top of giving quality games, creators, and performers their flowers, we got a boatload of new games to look forward to. So we ask: what was your favorite game announcement of the show?
Did the reveal of sequels like Death Stranding 2, Hades II, or Armored Core VI get you psyched? How about new IPs such as Ken Levine’s Judas, Dontnod’s Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, and Crime Boss: Rockay City? Did new trailers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy XVI raise your anticipation for those titles or put them on your radar? How head-turning was that weird Bayonetta prequel? 
The table is set, and it’s time to feast. Let us know your favorite announcement(s) in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>A generation of fans may love From Software for its litany of Souls games, but the studio was once primarily known for its other beloved series, Armored Core. Tonight at The Game Awards, the studio revealed a new entry in its mech shooter franchise: Armored Core IV: Fires of Rubicon. 
A cinematic trailer set the table, which begins on a rather gloomy (and lava-filled) note before the mechs emerge to kick up the tempo a few notches. Fires of Rubicon is the first entry in the series since 2013’s Armored Core: Verdict Day, so fans have waited a long time for tonight’s news. Check out the trailer below. 


Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is launching in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>While the new trailer for the upcoming expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 starts out with some voice lines from Keanu Reeves, the surprise appearance comes from a newly revealed character. Solomon Reed appears as a new figure played by Idris Elba.
Few concrete details are apparent from the trailer, but the spirit and visual styling of Cyberpunk 2077 remains in clear evidence. We know that Phantom Liberty is built as a spy-thriller set in a new district of Night City and that V somehow works together with the government of the New United States of America, and presumably alongside the newly revealed Solomon Reed.
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is set for release in 2023 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Final Fantasy 16 has a release date. Announced tonight during The Game Awards, Square Enix revealed the game will be released on June 22, 2023.
Following in the tradition of other FF16 trailers, our new glimpse looks great – and definitely expensive. From combat, bosses, story, and world, everything pops off screen – a few short minutes of bombast and spectacle.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer for its upcoming sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s another dark and terrifying look at the Soulslike series. 
Lords of the Fallen was released back in 2014, and GI Games revealed its long-awaited sequel, The Lords of the Fallen, during Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live back in August. A new trailer showcasing another look at the world of this sequel was released during The Game Awards 2022 tonight, and while it only featured a few glimpses of gameplay, it seems The Lords of the Fallen is shaping up to be a worthy successor. 
Watch The Lords of the Fallen gameplay teaser below: 


The Lords of the Fallen is set 1,000 years after the original Lords of the Fallen, and it&#x27;s been designed with cooperative play in mind, according to Hexworks. Two players can play together in uninterrupted online play and experience an &quot;expansive RPG experience filled with NPC quests, compelling characters, and rich narrative,&quot; according to a press release from earlier this year. 
The Lords of the Fallen will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. A release date has not yet been revealed, but it&#x27;s due out sometime in 2023.

                              <span>Activision has announced Crash Team Rumble, a 4v4 team-based online multiplayer game starring Crash Bandicoot and his furry/scaly friends. The game sees Toys for Bob, the studio behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time, step back into the developer role for the Crash Bandicoot series, but with a decidedly different approach in tow.
Crash Team Rumble puts players in the shoes of Crash, Dingodile, and the Bandicoot&#x27;s stable of friends and enemies. Each character has their own powers, personality, and playstyle as they duke it out in 4v4 competitions across a wide array of arenas. The teams compete in a variety of activities to bank the most Wumpa fruit in their drop-off zone while simultaneously defending it.
&quot;We&#x27;re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,&quot; Paul Yan, co-studio head at Toys for Bob said in a press release. &quot;Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone – easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero&#x27;s unique abilities.&quot;
You can see the reveal trailer below.


Crash Team Rumble comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2023. The game features cross-platform play, so you thankfully won&#x27;t need to coordinate with friends or agonize over which version to pick up.</span>

                              <span>Dontnod Entertainment has revealed their next game: Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden. While Dontnod is known best for its work on the Life is Strange series, Banishers is an action/RPG, and it might share more in common with the studio&#x27;s 2018 game Vampyr. For a better look at the game, check out the teaser below.


In the reveal trailer, a man sits across the table from a woman, holding her hand. Another person in the room calls the man a banisher, one who hunts ghosts. Then, the woman at the table dissolves away into a blue light, indicating that she was a ghost the whole time. Afterward, we get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like, with the man and his ghostly companion leaping into battle with an undead creature called a bonewalker.
Outside that brief trailer, we got a release window. Near the end of 2023, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.
While the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.
Check out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.</span>

Blue Protocol was not announced during the 2022 Game Awards, but up until now, it hasn&#x27;t been clear if the game would be making its way outside of Japan. During the show, a new trailer for the game was shared, alongside a confirmation that the game would be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in new regions the second half of 2023. Amazon Games also shared that Blue Protocol would be receiving a closed beta early next year.


Blue Protocol will be free-to-play, but will be playable in full for free. Monetization will come from character customizations and other cosmetics. Amazon Games also shared that the game can be played alone, or cooperatively with friends.</span>

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 launches in August 2023, developer Larian Studios announced during tonight&#x27;s The Game Awards. The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game&#x27;s Collector&#x27;s Edition.
The Collector&#x27;s Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector&#x27;s Edition certificate. The Collector&#x27;s Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.
On top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira&#x27;s return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. You can see the trailer below.


Prior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has achieved a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing. According to the Steam page, version 1.0 will include all classes and races, and most spells from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook, plus Acts 2 and 3 of the Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 story.</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for Tekken 8 and it features our first look at gameplay. 
The trailer showcases various Tekken 8 fighters, including series mainstay Jin Kazama. His mother, Jun Kazama, makes an appearance in the trailer as well to tell Jin that together, they&#x27;ll &quot;cleanse the world of its evil and corruption.&quot; 
Check out the Tekken 8 gameplay trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tekken 8 is looking great. The trailer above is mostly focused on teasing details about the game&#x27;s story, which will seemingly feature Jin and the struggles of his family dynamic (thanks, Heihachi). There are also quick clips of Tekken 8 gameplay, although it&#x27;s void of the UI that showcases each fighter&#x27;s HP and other elements. 
Tekken 8 was revealed earlier this year during a PlayStation State of Play held in September. That reveal trailer focused on Kazuya and his son, Jin, and you can watch it here. 
Tekken 8 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. It does not yet have a release date.

                              <span>Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. 
The trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it&#x27;s a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.&quot; Then everything truly goes off the rails. 
Giant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima&#x27;s previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, &quot;Should we have connected,&quot; casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:


We&#x27;re calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). 
During a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other &quot;visual&quot; works.
No real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.</span>

From the trailer below, the game seems to adhere closly to the Metroidvania platforming action of Celeste, but there&#x27;s likely more than meets the eye. Unfortunatley, we won&#x27;t get to play Earthblade until 2024 and there are no announced platforms as of yet.</span>

                              <span>A new clip from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League reveals that Kevin Conroy, who passed away earlier this year, will return to play Batman. Conroy made his first appearance as Batman in 1992’s Batman: The Animated Series and has continued to play the character in countless shows, movies, and games. He portrayed Batman in the Arkham games, the series Rocksteady is best known for.


Unlike the Arkham games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a co-op shooter. Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Deadshot are on a mission to stop the Justice League after supervillain Brainiac corrupts them and forces them to wreak havoc on humanity. While it sounds like a bleak premise, this trailer also gives a good look at the dark humor the Suicide Squad is known for.
Rocksteady also announced that the game would be coming out on May 26, 2023, just a few months from now. This news comes following years of delays and will set it eight years after the studio’s last game, Batman: Arkham Knight.</span>

That info was confirmed in this evening’s trailer at The Game Awards, so we now know with confidence that the game is targeting a launch on March 17.
The trailer was accompanied by a visit from Cal Kestis himself, Cameron Monaghan. The actor is returning to play the beleaguered Jedi in the sequel, and he was around to follow up after the trailer to discuss his enthusiasm for the game. 
For fans eagerly anticipating new details, the trailer offers a lot over which to muse. We see that Cal looks like a more grizzled and powerful Jedi than when we last saw him training to become a knight. That truth is denoted perhaps most po…</span>

                              <span>Kratos voice actor Christopher Judge has revealed that he initially quit when he learned that someone other than God of War (2018) director Cory Barlog was directing God of War Ragnarök. Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. 
Fortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.


Here&#x27;s what he said: 
&quot;I think it&#x27;s kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn&#x27;t be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, &#x27;Nah, I vouch for Eric.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Eric Williams better be a beast.&#x27; Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.&quot;
It&#x27;s unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.</span>

                              <span>Helping to ramp up an evening of world premieres at The Game Awards this evening, Supergiant Games revealed its newest game. Hot on the heels of the wild success of Hades, Supergiant is doing something it’s never done before: crafting a sequel.
After its previous work on titles like Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, the studio’s new game takes us back to the roguelike playstyle of the original game, but with a new female lead fighting their way through hordes of enemies.
Instead of Zagreus’ attempted escape from Hades, Hades 2 sees players attempting to descend to fight against the titan named Kronos. The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.
Beyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.</span>

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>Ghost Story Games, the team led by BioShock creator Ken Levine, finally unveiled its first project. It&#x27;s called Judas, and if you&#x27;re a BioShock fan, you&#x27;ll be happy with what you&#x27;re about to see. 
To say this title follows in BioShock&#x27;s footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine&#x27;s work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:
&quot;You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?&quot;


Levine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They&#x27;ve been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we&#x27;d see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team&#x27;s first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it&#x27;s nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.
Judas doesn&#x27;t have a release window, but it&#x27;s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>At long last, Street Fighter 6 has a release date. Hot on the heels of a second beta test announcement (and retailer leaks earlier this morning), Capcom announced that the next entry arrives on June 2. On top of that, we received a new trailer and details on the Deluxe Edition.
When Street Fighter 6 launches, it will deliver new innovations like real-time commentary, multiple control schemes, and World Tour mode. The base game includes 18 characters ranging from iconic names like Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Blanka to new faces like Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly. For the full list of characters coming to the base game, head here.
The new trailer showed off the World Tour mode, which lets you customize your avatar and travel the world to locations like the US, France, and more. We also got a new look at several previously announced but not-yet-revealed characters, including Dee Jay, Manon, Marisa, and JP.


An earlier leak on Amazon also revealed Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, the Year 1 Character Pass featuring four characters, colors 3 through 10 of each Year 1 character, and a bonus 4,200 Drive Tickets for in-game purchases.
We recently flew to Osaka, Japan for our most recent cover story and came away impressed with the studio&#x27;s vision and our extended hands-on time with the game. For more on our trip to Capcom&#x27;s headquarters, including a fun Rapid-Fire interview and deep dives into the character designs, visit the cover hub by clicking on the banner below. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Piccolo Studio, the makers of 2019&#x27;s Arise: A Simple Story, unveiled its next project, After Us, during The Game Awards.
Set on a dead Earth after the extinction of humans and wildlife, players control Gaia, the Spirit of Life, who must recover what’s left by restoring the souls of perished animals while learning how they met their fate. Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  


After Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.</span>

                              <span>Update, 12/9/2022:
A &quot;brief playable teaser&quot; for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is available now within Bayonetta 3. According to Nintendo, &quot;Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser.&quot;
Original Story, 12/8/2022:
Hot on the heels of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. 
Stepping away from the series&#x27; traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character&#x27;s combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola&#x27;s only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. 
Narratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.</span>

                              <span>Announced with a trailer at the Game Awards, Returnal, the formerly PS5-exclusive shooter, is coming to PC. Unfortunately, no release window was given.


Returnal is a roguelike third-person shooter developed by Housemarque, and was one of the first exclusives released on PS5 when it came out in April 2021. You play as Selene Vassos, an astronaut that finds herself stuck in a time loop on an alien planet. It made an appearance at last year&#x27;s game awards as well, where it was nominated for three awards and won Best Action Game. If you want to learn more about the game, you can read our review, where we called it &quot;a relentless nightmare that’s a dream to play.&quot;
For more announcements from the 2022 Game Awards, we&#x27;ll be covering everything here on Game Informer.</span>

Toho jsou si patrně vědomi i vývojáři a včera oznámili dvě nové funkce spořič paměti (Memory Saver) a spořič energie (Energy Saver). Spořič paměti má ušetřit až 40 % paměti a to tím, že bude uspávat neaktivní karty. Tedy dělá to stejné jako například rozšíření Auto Tab Discard (pro Chrome, pro Firefox). Uspáním karty přijdete o aktuální stav, čemuž půjde u vybraných stránek zabránit nastavením Always keep these sites active.</span>

The indictment, which contains a seizure order worth $1.2 million, reveals the man was logged into email accounts and crypto wallets during a police raid. An earlier case, involving IPTV, an uncooperative defendant, and a crypto hardware wallet, delivered quite a surprise at the 11th hour.

                              <span>Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
