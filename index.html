                              <span>Wube Software has revealed another change coming to Factorio: Space Age in their latest Friday Facts #376 blog post with a rework to the Research and Technology system. With the introduction of new planets to explore and build on, new and unique resources are also available to mine. The new system could create some interesting problems in terms of requiring research to discover and operate on a planet, while in turn requiring research science packs to be made from resources from said planet.


The solution Wube Software is opting for is trigger technologies. That is, technologies that unlock via a certain event trigger, rather than science packs. Examples include mining an entity, crafting a specific item, or launching a rocket with a certain item. With this new system, landing on a planet…</span>

                              <span>yeo, the developer of such titles as The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa and Arrest of a Stone Buddha released their next game Fading Afternoon on September 14. 


Fading Afternoon is an RPG beat ‘em up following Seiji Maruyama, a member of the yakuza who has recently been released from prison. Per the game’s page on Steam, there are multiple endings, a variety of minigames, and an entire city to explore. Admittedly, yeo was sparse on the game’s details, but one sentence has this writer immediately intrigued: 


“Old tropes are here but you can choose to not follow them. The question is — does anything really matter that much now?”




yeo released The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa on May 17, 2018, and their second game Arrest of a Stone Buddha on February 27, 2020. A manga adaptation of Ringo Ishikawa was published later in 2020, on October 9. Fading Afternoon marks the developer’s return after more than three years.


Fading Afternoon will normally set you back $19.99, but if you buy before September 21, you can get it for $17.99, which represents a 10% discount. At the time of writing, the game has been received quite well, earning a “Very Positive” label just a day following its release.

In the release, Willingham takes shots at publisher DC Comics for being “in violation of their agreements” for years and reveals his vision of a reformed IP system that would force all IP to be submitted to the public domain after thirty years.


Among his chief complaints with DC is his claim the comics giant has been trying to take the Fables IP from him through willful misinterpretation of their publishing contract.

                              <span>Unexpected Studios has announced that their co-op furniture building game KallaX will release on PC September 18, 2023.


I don’t know why prefabricated furniture instructions sometimes tell you to work with a partner because building furniture together is one of the quickest ways to drive someone to desperate ends. When we moved a few years ago, my husband and I bought a lot of Ikea furniture, and it’s amazing that we’re still together. However, near the end of it, I was quietly assembling media centers by myself in the other room.




KallaX, for some reason, is attempting to replicate that experience endlessly in a co-op video game format. You play as little space men who must work together to gather parts and assemble furniture to ship out. It’s one part Overcooked and two parts malicious intent. It’s the whole experience: instructions, construction, and violent urges.


I usually bring these sorts of games to play with my parents and test their 40-some years of marriage. After all those years, my father has become an expert at annoying my mother, and it has never stopped being funny. Unfortunately, the current release is PC only. It’s a lot harder to gather people around my computer monitor, and while there are options to stream to my TV, I’m not lugging my PC to my parents’ house. Hopefully, a console port will follow, but for now, KallaX will have an online co-op if you feel comfortable playing with people outside the range of a good, motivating charlie horse.


KallaX releases for PC on September 18, 2023.

                              <span>Lies of P is a dark fantasy soulslike that retells Pinocchio&#x27;s story with a grim twist. It&#x27;s replicating Bloodborne&#x27;s vibe which not many other big-budget games have tried. The parallels are so blatant between the two that it almost comes as a detriment to the game.


What Bloodborne doesn&#x27;t have is a hanging puppet with a sign reading &quot;APAB&quot; on it. Lies of P doesn&#x27;t have one either now, as it was removed from the game before release.


The sign appeared in one image, referencing the saying &quot;All Cops Are Bastards&quot; or ACAB. It stands out so much that it caught the eye of videogames.si&#x27;s Georgina Young, who interviewed Lies of P&#x27;s director Ji-Won Choi about it.


Despite being such a small part of the game, Choi was happy to talk about it. He clarified that the sign stands for &quot;All Puppets are Bastards&quot; before jumping into its removal.


The sign&#x27;s removal came down to not wanting to be &quot;judged based on following trends,&quot; according to Choi. Lies of P had several other &quot;risky factors&quot; removed to not alienate players. 


If left in the final product, it could have echoed something like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&#x27;s &quot;mechanical apartheid&quot; which was seen as being in bad taste. Lies of P differs in that APAB never took a large role its marketing.


A part of me wonders if other in-game signs took real-life inspiration since the other signs had no elaboration. Puppets are the game&#x27;s antagonists, and their depiction could have also taken more real-world inspiration at one point.


This hypothetical version of Lies of P and the sign are not in the final product. At least the game&#x27;s message still appears to be that all puppets are bastards.

The latest addition rings the bell for another round with the anime adaptation of Kohei Horikoshi&#x27;s smash hit manga My Hero Academia. This time players can deck themselves out like Shoto Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima, and Mina Ashido, battling with countless other wisps of pop culture ephemera within an ever-shifting battlefield. It&#x27;s a simple opportunity to play around with a set of fan favorites, and it&#x27;s just the latest example of a continuing trend in Fortnite that has resulted in standout visuals and some truly impressive feats of licensing wizardry.

                              <span>The demo for One More Level and 505 Games&#x27; first-person slasher, Ghostrunner 2, is now available. However, that&#x27;s not the exciting bit about it. Instead, this particular shindig is a big deal because the demo features one of the game&#x27;s big new gameplay hooks: a driveable motorcycle. While trailers have shown off this feature, it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a given that it&#x27;d be available for players to check out in the demo. Especially since the game is due to launch soon, on October 26.


Ghostrunner 2&#x27;s vehicular combat is already a bit of a point of contention in the community, however. On the game&#x27;s subreddit, players have highlighted a wealth of bugs in the demo and a bit of indecisiveness as to whether One More Level did the right thing when it decided to include the bike. To that end, this demo may not jive all that well with all the fans of the original Ghostrunner.

Will Ghostrunner 2 pull combat bikes off?


The opinions on Ghostrunner 2&#x27;s all-new bike are mixed so far, it would seem. While some players enjoy its speed and brutality, others are put off by their lack of control over the machine. If One More Level intended for the bike to be this game&#x27;s wow feature, it might not pan out on this merit alone.


The good news, though, is that the demo itself shows that Ghostrunner 2 is a true-to-form sequel. Players should expect an ability rebalance and a slightly modified movement system, with a greater focus on having a coherent narrative and, according to the devs, more freedom in creating a character build. All great news for those who just wanted more of Ghostrunner, of course. But the bike itself may end up being a bit of an acquired taste for the community in general.


Ghostrunner 2 will launch on October 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

                              <span>The sequel to 2018&#x27;s highly acclaimed arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo has officially launched on PC and the Nintendo Switch, though many might&#x27;ve missed this due to its Epic Games Store exclusivity. Indeed, the king of free game giveaways has scored yet another exclusivity deal, following a relatively long period of not going after them. The last high-profile Epic exclusive was Dead Island 2, discounting the variety of Ubisoft titles that are specifically avoiding Steam, but this time, it makes sense that it&#x27;s happening.


Notably, Epic Games acquired the Horizon Chase developer, Aquiris, earlier in 2023. Given that he studio had previously released Horizon Chase 2 on mobile phones with plans to release it on the Switch and PC later on, it was rather easy to see the writing on the wall.

                              <span>Despite a couple of delays, Frictional Games finally released Amnesia: The Bunker in June, representing a return to form in the iconic Amnesia series. Now, get ready for an even tougher time in this WW1 setting, as an even tougher difficulty mode is on the way.


According to Creative Lead Fredrik Olsson (as spotted by Rock Paper Shotgun), the latest Amnesia game is getting a Halloween update, which includes a &quot;shell shocked mode.&quot; This new difficulty will see the immersive sim horror game present an even greater challenge for players.




For starters, the admin office – where safety is pretty much a guarantee – will now have a wooden door instead of its usual metal barricade. This, presumably, means the stalking monster will be able to get to the player, thus assuring nowhere is safe.


Nope. Can&#x27;t hide there, either.


At times of great stress, at least you can always count on the menu to pause the action, giving you a moment to rest. Not in the update. According to Olsson, time will not stop when you enter the menu screen.


What else? Oh yes. The update for Amnesia: The Bunker will also be introducing &quot;new and randomized locations of corpses, dog tags and bunker rats.&quot;


And if just these features weren&#x27;t enough, it also looks like the pistol – your one and only defense – is going to be stored in a locker. Therefore, you&#x27;ll have to find a code for the padlock before you can get to it.


There doesn&#x27;t appear to be an exact date for when this patch is going to start rolling out, so look out for it in the closing days of October. Suffice it to say, &quot;shell shock mode&quot; is going to sort the Amnesia wheat from the chaff.

                              <span>Around the launch of the Xbox Series X/S, there were a few strange products from Xbox, including the Xbox fridge. The latest gimmick from the company is the Xbox Mastercard, which is equally as unexpected but may provide more practical uses. 


As explained in the blog post, the no annual fee Xbox Mastercard will allow you to earn points as you spend. The points can be spent on games and add-ons at xbox.com. For anyone enticed, take note that there are terms and conditions. The card is only available to customers in the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii from September 21. 


To sign up for the card, you&#x27;ll have to be an Xbox Insider, which is simply a program where you can give feedback on the latest Xbox system updates, features, and games. If you don&#x27;t want to join the program, you&#x27;ll have to wait until 2024 when the card will be available to all players in the USA.

Why does the Xbox Mastercard exist


With a large Xbox logo on your credit card, you&#x27;ll quickly let your cashier know exactly what kind of person they&#x27;re dealing with. You&#x27;ll also gain points when spending at the following places:



Microsoft - you earn 5x points on eligible products on the Microsoft store


Streaming - you earn 3x points on participating streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+


Delivery - you earn 3x points on participating dining delivery services such as GrubHub and DoorDash


Everyday purchases - earn 1x on everyday purchases



There are also some additional benefits that may appeal to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming. You&#x27;ll get three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate after your first purchase if you&#x27;re a new Game Pass member. There&#x27;s also the option to personalize your card with your gamertag. 


It appears the Xbox Mastercard will find a cosy home alongside other quirky gaming products such as the Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller and the luxurious Starfield chair.

Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord was the first in the series and launched all the way back in the primordial days of 1981 on the Apple II. It was one of the games that popularized dungeon crawlers and helped translate tabletop RPGs to the home computer. It’s not the first, however. Richard Garriot’s Akalabeth predates it by a year and DunjonQuest: Temple of Apshai by two. Even before that, there were attempts to recreate Dungeons and Dragons on mainframe computers.


On the other hand, you could consider Wizardry to be the seminal dungeon crawler RPG. It set the standards for a lot of first-person dungeon crawlers that wou…</span>

                              <span>If major RPG franchises like Final Fantasy introduced me to RPGs, it’s the B-tier titles that made me love the genre. Throughout the SNES, PSX, and PS2 eras of gaming, those lower budget, heartfelt RPGs were my bread and butter. Games like Illusion of Gaia (and later Terranigma), Lunar: The Silver Star Story, and Wild Arms meant so much to me, and I’m always in search of titles that capture that same creative energy. The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails may not come from that same time period, but it is absolutely cut from that same cloth.


Granted, it’s no surprise that I would like this one (sorry, spoilers). The Legend of Nayuta was originally released by Nihon Falcom for the PSP in 2012, AKA the creators of the Ys series. If you read my bio at the bottom of this article, you could g…</span>

                              <span>In the opening section of Starfield, we&#x27;re introduced to Vasco, the bulky robot that assists you on your quest to meet up with Constellation. Now, a figurine of the heavy-duty machine will soon be yours to own. But it&#x27;s going to set you back a bit.


As spotted by GamesRadar, a company called PureArts that specializes in collectibles is launching its own line of Vasco figures. The Starfield companion is available to pre-order now, with a proposed release date of Q3, 2024.




The model itself is fully articulated and is a 1/6th representation of its video game counterpart. However, be prepared to fork over quite a bit as it&#x27;s priced at $369. That does seem quite steep for a figure of a video game character.


Some more details


Images on the site, as well as the above video, show how much detail has gone into this replica of the Starfield NPC. As well as having 15 points of articulation, this Vasco keepsake has also been licensed by Bethesda, so it&#x27;s a legit piece of memorabilia.


Some additional info:



Polyresin


Highly detailed painted sculpt


Fully articulated legs, arms, hands, and fingers


Scuffed paint and dented panels give a genuine in-game feel


Exclusive Item: &quot;The Artifact&quot; on a wood base



Basically, if you&#x27;ve been digging Starfield lately, and you&#x27;re a fan of collectibles, this could be right up your alley. It is quite pricey, but its level of detail and the fact that it&#x27;s been officially licensed may explain the cost. To some extent, at least.

                              <span>Just weeks following the launch of Immortals of Aveum, developer Ascendant Studios has laid off approximately 45% of its team, according to a report by Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter and testimony from some of the impacted employees. Ascendant CEO Bret Robbins explained the layoffs in a Twitter post as “a painfully difficult, but necessary decision that was not made lightly.”




It is unclear at press time what the specific reason for the layoffs is, though the Polygon report says a former Ascendant employee attributed them to Immortals of Aveum’s poor sales. Robbins doesn’t elaborate on that in the public statement, though he does say “we have to make this adjustment now that Immortals of Aveum has shipped.”


Immortals of Aveum launched on August 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. The game was published by EA and marketed as an EA Original, but despite that, according to SteamDB, player totals haven’t exceeded 200 the entire month of September. It would seem the game could be a contender for worst selling game under the EA Originals branding, as stated by an anonymous former employee in the Polygon report.


Robbins, in his post on Twitter, confirms that Ascendent is “supporting those affected in every way we can, including comprehensive severance packages and job placement assistance,” and goes on to assure the current team, as well as those involved in these layoffs, that the studio will continue to support the development of the Immortals IP “with future updates and offers.”

Playtonic Friends and developer MegaWobble confirmed plans for the ports, which will launch on October 10, 2023. Newly supported platforms include PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. 


Those who pick up the PlayStation or Xbox versions will get access to the full game and the new content that dropped on Switch and Steam last month. That includes New Game+ mode, as well as the &quot;baby mode&quot; that&#x27;s accessible from the main menu. 


An updated trailer is here for a refresher on the adventure game that emphasizes joyful exploration. The preview offers another look at the game&#x27;s quaint action and playful sense of fun. 




A view to a chill


In addition to the main content, Playtonic provided details on the presentation of the ports. Lil Gator Game will run in 4k on PlayStation 4 Pro, PlayStation 5, Xbox One X, and Xbox Series X. It will be 1080p on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox One S, and 1440p on Xbox Series S. All of the PlayStation and Xbox versions will also run at 60fps. 


With less than a month to go before the October 10 launch, the PlayStation and Xbox store pages are now live for Lil Gator Game. Those who long for bygone days of wide-eyed exploration and want an experience that goes light on pressure might find it to be a quiet delight.

Whether it&#x27;s out of excitement or concern depends on the person. 


To someone like Microsoft executive Sarah Bond, AI&#x27;s prospects are exciting. She&#x27;s the head of creator experience and ecosystem at Xbox, and in an interview with Inverse, Bond sheds light on where she believes gaming should go.


According to Bond, gaming is on the &quot;precipice of a YouTube or SoundCloud moment&quot; where technology will allow greater collective freedom. She refers to a future of &quot;citizen creators,&quot; a democratized creation space further fueled by AI.

                              <span>Today&#x27;s double-header of showcase streams has come to an end, as the September 2023 Sony State of Play just wrapped. It had some ups and downs, but certainly went out with a big closer.


Both today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct and State of Play ended on remakes of beloved RPGs, which is pretty rad. In Sony&#x27;s case, Square Enix brought out the big guns with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, locking in a launch date for the second entry of its remake trilogy that really isn&#x27;t too far off.




But let&#x27;s not discount the other announcements, either. There&#x27;s a surprising reveal of some DLC for Tales of Arise, some fresh looks at known games, and of course, virtual reality games. No State of Play is complete without some VR. Here&#x27;s all the headlines.

                              <span>During the September 2023 State of Play, we got a Release Date Announcement Trailer for Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. At the end of the trailer we got a first look at the Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector&#x27;s Edition, and oh boy is it beautiful. Included is a 19-inch Sephiroth statue—in pure Sephiroth form, might I add—as well as a sick-looking steel book. Unfortunately, you&#x27;re gonna have to shell out a lot of Gil for this one. The Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth Collector&#x27;s Edition is priced at $349.99.




Materia(l) things


As per usual with Square Enix Collector&#x27;s Editions, supplies are limited and only available through the Square Enix Store. Full contents include the Deluxe Edition of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, the Sephiroth statue, and the following DLC:



Moogle Trio Summoning Materia (DLC)

A summoning materia that can call &quot;Moogle Trio&quot; in the game.




Magic Pot Summoning Materia (DLC)

A summoning materia that can call &quot;Magic Pot&quot; in the game.




Accessory: Reclaimant Choker (DLC)

A choker with an effect of restoring HP when an enemy is defeated.




Armor: Orchid Bracelet (DLC)

A bracelet that gives courage to traverse an expanding world.




Armor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II (DLC)

A bracelet worn by travelers leaving Midgar.





As much as I want this, I don&#x27;t think I can justify it. The statue looks decent quality, but certainly not price-of-a-console quality. But, for those who collect this stuff, I&#x27;m sure this is just what they were looking for. Still, it does feel like the price on these Collector&#x27;s Editions continues to rise while the contents shift to mostly digital stuff.


For me it&#x27;s all about the steelbook, which it appears actually comes with the Deluxe Edition which is priced at $99.99. That seems a bit more reasonable to me.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth releases exclusively on PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024.

                              <span>Two years after launch, Tales of Arise is getting another slice of story. Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn looks to add more onto the tale of Dahna and Rena on November 9, 2023.


Shown during today&#x27;s State of Play, the trailer shows the whole gang reuniting, one year after the events of the main game&#x27;s story. Alphen looks to be taking care of a child that&#x27;s on the run due to her lineage, and the crew gets wrapped up in the drama around it.




We can see the return of some familiar faces and locales in the trailer, as well as some new sights to see. In a press release, Bandai Namco says to expect over 20 hours of new game content with new quests, dungeons, boss fights, and a new story arc.


It sounds like there will also be a bit of a new start in this expansion. In a PlayStation Blog, producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that although Beyond the Dawn is a sequel to the main story, the team wanted all users to be ale to enjoy the game at &quot;the appropriate level of design.&quot;



&quot;In order to ensure this, a certain level of skills and other statuses are provided at the start, and we did not adopt a simple transfer of levels and statuses from the main game. Instead, we have prepared bonuses such as money and skill points based on the clear data of the main game, so we hope that you will enjoy the new story while taking advantage of these bonuses and developing the characters to your own liking.&quot;
- Yusuke Tomizawa, General Producer, Bandai Namco



Arise once more


Honestly, I really didn&#x27;t see this one coming. I really liked Tales of Arise, and it seemed to get some newcomers into the Tales series in general too. Even though the original game wrapped up pretty neatly, I won&#x27;t say no to more time with this team.


Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn is set to arrive on November 9 for PlayStation

                              <span>Put down that controller. Dr. Tom Tilley has shown us the way to play Puzzle Bobble (also known for years as Bust-A-Move in the West) as the Gods of Finger Dexterity intended: by using a salad spinner.


If you’re like me, you don’t put dirty plants in your mouth, so you might not know what a salad spinner is. My research suggests that it’s a device used to remove water from leafy vegetables after you wash them. It uses centrifugal force to separate the water and dry the leaves. This means that when you drown the salad in ranch dressing, the creamy sauce will stick to it.




To turn this device of vegetal torture into a controller, Dr. Tilley used some cardboard, an optical mouse, and an external button. Then, when the crank is turned, the mouse movement is read on the game. I’m not sure if this is a PC port of Puzzle Bobble I’m not aware of, or if he’s edited the input. That seems like it would be the hardest part of the process for me.


This isn’t the first Puzzle Bobble controller that Dr. Tilley has MacGyver’d together. Previously, he has created a similar contraption using a coffee grinder. He also got a little more constructive with some tubing. On top of this, he made a Katamari Damacy controller with an actual ball. It’s pretty creative stuff. Meanwhile, I can rarely be bothered to set up my racing wheel.

                              <span>It’s almost time for Spider-Man 2, and it’s in that sentiment that Insomniac Games has revealed a brand new look at the game in today’s PlayStation State of Play. In this first look at how the sequel aims to evolve the open world concept, senior director Bryan Intihar showed off the game’s world, which has effectively doubled in size when you consider the inclusion of both Brooklyn and Queens. 




Players can now take advantage of the web-wings, which, when paired with traditional web-slinging, can completely change how they explore the game world. There will be more varied locales to check out with these new transportation mechanics, including Midtown High and Miles Morales’ very own Brooklyn Visions Academy. As players traverse New York fighting baddies left and right, they will be able to switch between Peter Parker and Miles Morales at will, and because of the PlayStation 5’s advanced hardware, the transition time is nearly nonexistent, according to Intihar.


Tied to the increased size of the overworld is the new district rewards system which will unlock a variety of rewards, including fast travel points, on the off chance players don’t feel like manually traveling. One feature that makes a return from past installments is the ability to customize appearance. According to Intihar, Spider-Man 2 will feature more than 65 different suits to pick from.

                              <span>We often hear that videogames can have a positive impact upon the world, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen somebody use one - an antique strategy sim, no less - to advocate for appropriately balancing the level design of your front lawn so as to stop indigenous insects being overrun by smaller invading species. The scientific research paper in question - uploaded in August this year, and brought to my attention by RPS contributor and apparent ant enthusiast Matt Cox - sees researchers Samuel J. Lymbery, Bruce L. Webber and Raphael K. Didham use Age of Empires 2 to study how human shaping of the environment affects the balance of power between the indigenous Australian &quot;meat ant&quot;, or Iridomyrmex purpureus, and the Argentine ant, or Linepithema humile, who are one of the world&#x27;s more invasive ant species.

                              <span>Alas, more sad news today, folks. Our brilliant guides writer Hayden Hefford has just completed their final day at RPS. From the end of September, they&#x27;ll be starting a new life of scholarly enlightenment as they head off to university, undertaking that most noble of pursuits: the quest for infinite knowledge. We&#x27;ll miss them dearly, so please join me in the comments below to say farewell.

                              <span>Space Mechanic Simulator almost had me. The promise of jetpacking over to satellites and stations then tinkering in their innards is a solid one, and adjacent to my impossible space salvage game dream. Elements of it work. Others are within acceptable levels of wonkiness for me personally. But it needs a bit of an overhaul to fix some silly design choices it&#x27;s hobbled itself with.

                              <span>Now that’s more like it. The Radeon RX 7700 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics cards don’t just fill out a 1440p-shaped hole in AMD’s current lineup – they both, the latter in particular, make the kind of spirited attempt to get up in Nvidia’s face that previous red team GPUs simply didn’t.

Four years later, after multiple delays, Drop Bear Bytes’ fascinating throwback is finally almost here - close enough to get a proper full release date.

                              <span>One of the things I like best about Die Gute Fabrik&#x27;s forthcoming Saltsea Chronicles is an optional feature. It&#x27;s a card game, Spoils, which you can play while sojourning upon the game&#x27;s islands and searching for clues about your ship&#x27;s missing captain, Maja. Here&#x27;s how it works: two teams of two characters take turns to play cards, moving in clockwise around a table. Player must follow the lead player&#x27;s suit, and the highest-scoring card wins the trick, with four tricks comprising a round. It might sound like a straightforward competition, but different islands offer different house rules, and there are twists that reflect the game&#x27;s ethic of community, mutual respect and diversity, and help animate the detail of its gently post-apocalyptic oceanic world. 
The winning card from each trick is handed to the loser, so victory is, in its way, an act of generosity. Score more than 100 points in a round, meanwhile, and the &quot;Hoarding&quot; rule means you must relinquish those points to the other team. As Die Gute Fabrik&#x27;s CEO and creative lead Hannah Nicklin observes, this fits the post-capitalist politics and mythology of Saltsea, in which &quot;hoarding is sort of seen as the apocryphal cause of the flood&quot;. The Spoils tutorial menus riff on this with a cute but mildly unsettling image of a sinking ship.

                              <span>Friends, I am excited. A new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth dropped last night during the Playstation State Of Play stream, and holy cow, despite feeling a bit ill and exhausted and generally not firing on all cylinders at the moment, I think I might be more pumped for this than literally any other video game on the horizon right now. Even that long-awaited PC release of Final Fantasy 16 can&#x27;t quite compare to this, if you ask me, and I might even be more enthused by it than the prospect of a Switch 2. And I don&#x27;t even really like Final Fantasy VII! That&#x27;s how much Nomura&#x27;s mad, timey-wimey game child has sunk its teeth into me. I&#x27;m mostly here just to see what mad nonsense comes Cloud&#x27;s way next - and from the looks of things, it&#x27;s a lot.

                              <span>A big shout out to indie games that are successors to existing games in all but name. It&#x27;s gotta be one of my favourite trends. Fed up of waiting for a big publisher to revive a series that’s been lying dormant for decades? Simply do it yourself instead. 11 years after the release of Jet Set Radio Future, and with Sega seemingly unwilling to exhume their cult-favourite rollerblading series outside of weird crossovers with Ubisoft’s Roller Champions of all things, Team Reptile have done exactly that.
Enter Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, as authentic a sequel to Jet Set Radio as you can get. Dripping with style and oozing cool, the team have crafted a carefully observed love letter that both respects and advances the original duology in meaningful ways, while taking a step back in others.

                              <span>US author and artist Bill Willingham has rather dramatically announced that he is placing the Fables comicbook property in the public domain, including all Fables spin-offs and characters. This means that - pending a judgement from third-party legal experts, anyway - anyone can now create art of any kind set in the Fables universe. &quot;What was once wholly owned by Bill Willingham is now owned by everyone, for all time,&quot; the author wrote on his Substack. &quot;It&#x27;s done, and as most experts will tell you, once done it cannot be undone. Take-backs are neither contemplated nor possible.&quot;


You might recognise Fables as the universe in which Telltale&#x27;s The Wolf Among Us is set. It&#x27;s a grubby noir fairytale world in which bedtime story characters like Snow White and Prince Charming live discreetly among regular humans, aka Mundies, having been driven from their homelands by a mysterious Adversary. I confess I&#x27;ve not read any of the original comics - I&#x27;ve only ever played the Telltale adaptation, which I enjoyed. I feel guilty about that in hindsight, because Willingham seems to have a pretty dim view of Telltale&#x27;s work, though that&#x27;s partly to do with what he considers to be his longstanding unfair treatment by Fables publisher DC Comics.

                              <span>Riot Forge have been quietly building up quite the catalogue of League Of Legends side story games over the last couple of years. In November 2021, they launched the double whammy of rhythm runner Hextech Mayhem and turn-based RPG Ruined King, and this year alone we&#x27;ve already had action RPG The Mageseeker and narrative platformer Conv/rgence. As you can probably tell, they&#x27;re all focused on different genres, different League heroes, and have all come from different developers - and soon they&#x27;ll be joined by Song Of Nunu, the next game from Rime developers Tequila Works. 
I got to play a very small slice of it at Gamescom last month, and yep, if you&#x27;ve been craving another low stakes adventure that&#x27;s all but guaranteed to wrench at your heartstrings and wibble your tear ducts, Song Of Nunu will almost certainly fill that Rime-shaped hole in your life when it comes to PC on November 1st.

Nintendo surprised fans this week with the reveal of F-Zero 99, a new twist on the orignal SNES classic that throws 99 players into a single race to determine who will be the last machine standing.
It&#x27;s a neat throwback to the original that follows in the footsteps of Tetris 99 and PAC-MAN 99, and fans so far seem to be quite enamoured with the fresh spin on the F-Zero franchise. Even Tatakya Imamura, one of the key developers on the series until his departure from Nintendo, has expressed his love in a recent post on X.

Those who like to have a shiny Switch box on their shelves instead of a digital copy are in luck as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is landing an all-new &#x27;Anniversary Edition&#x27; physical copy which will include the recently-released &#x27;Dimension Shellshock&#x27; DLC.
The base game received a physical release last year, though this is the first time that the rougelike game mode expansion will be gracing the game cartridges — you can never have too many copies of one game, right?

                              <span>Back on the Trails.
The Trails series is known for its incredible worldbuilding through many different games, including Trails of Cold Steel, Trails from Zero, and Trails to Azure, as well as Trails in the Sky. The events of those games culminated with Trails into Reverie, which finally got a localized release this year.
The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails, however, has absolutely no connection with the mainline games. That’s actually a good thing as it means Boundless Trails can implement new mechanics without being beholden to them. This has an engaging real-time action combat system with plenty of great worldbuilding through side quests. However, the story is rather simplistic and sometimes the platforming feels imprecise. Still, Boundless Trails is a worthy spin-off deserving of the Trails name.

Unity recently announced plans to charge developers a fee each time a game utilising the Unity engine is installed via its new &#x27;runtime fee&#x27; policy.
While there are caveats to the policy in terms of its structure (there are minimum revenue and total install numbers to consider, for example), there&#x27;s no doubt that this will significantly impact studios upon its implementation from January 2024 (including, bizarrely enough, Nintendo - the 2021 Pokémon titles Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were built by developer ILCA using the Unity engine).

This one will be released in Japan this winter and publisher Neos has confirmed that the game will also be getting a worldwide release at a later date.

The latest Japanese charts are in and it&#x27;s another successful week for Pikmin 4, which once again beats out the competition to claim the top spot after selling an additional 31,013 units.
Otherwise, we&#x27;ve got a couple of new additions to the top ten, while Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon continues to perform well on PS4 and PS5. The usual big hitters maintain good momentum on Switch, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe coming in at number three and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom just hanging in there at number nine.

It was announced earlier this week that Mario Kart Tour would receive no new content updates as of the upcoming October &#x27;Battle Tour&#x27;. That means that the next update, the &#x27;Anniversary Tour&#x27;, will be the final fresh one that we are going to see in the game.
This is set to kick off on 20th September and will see you racing around a series of city courses to mark the game&#x27;s fourth anniversary. Gold Mario and his shiny kart seem to be at the forefront of this one — talk about going out in style.

To kick off the latest Nintendo Direct, Nintendo confirmed the Splatoon 3 story DLC &#x27;Side Order&#x27; would be arriving in Spring 2024.

Nintendo dropped quite the surprise at the end of the latest Direct, revealing the GameCube classic Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door would be returning with updated graphics on the Switch.
If you&#x27;re curious to see just how good this version looks alongside the original 2004 role-playing game, GameXplain has now released a side-by-side comparison video. The new version as you can see in the video above certainly looks more vibrant. It appears some paper patterns have also been changed, there seems to be some improved water effects and in general, it&#x27;s all looking a lot sharper.

With two fantastic Spider-Man games under Insomniac’s belt, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 feels like the culmination of the 2018 game and 2020’s Miles Morales in all the best ways. At a recent preview event, I spent roughly 90 minutes swinging and gliding across its new and improved New York City, taking down scores of bad guys and even challenging the Lizard. When my session concluded, I walked away thinking one thing: The first two games swung so that this third act could soar.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage brings players to 9th Century Baghdad during the city’s Golden Age. More specifically, the year 861 is when protagonist Basim Ibn Is&#x27;haq&#x27;s journey begins in this city, the technological and cultural epicenter of the region at the time. After playing more than two hours of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage in developer Ubisoft Bordeaux&#x27;s France-based office, I was impressed with its take on Baghdad. 
I love the open-world RPGs of the series&#x27; recent years, especially Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and Odyssey, but I’d be lying if I said I was a fan of their respective cities. It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t enjoy them, but they weren&#x27;t memorable in the same way Assassin&#x27;s Creed II’s Florence or Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&#x27;s Paris was.

The software can be used for perfectly legitimate purposes, but some also treat it as a piracy gateway. Yesterday, Plex informed users that it will no longer allow users to run servers at a hosting provider where lots of TOS violations occur. While copyright infringement isn&#x27;t specifically mentioned, the action appears anti-piracy focused.

                              <span>During the Sony State of Play, Square Enix announced its Splatoon-like multiplayer shooter Foamstars will host an open beta test at the end of this month, starting September 29.


The online paint war kicks off its Open Beta Party with two game modes, both pitting players against each other in chaotic arenas with teams of varying sizes. The Foamstars test run launches with two game modes, Smash the Star and Happy Bath Survival.


As for dates, Square Enix included a Foamstars open beta schedule adjusted based on timezone.



September 29, 6pm - October 1, 11:59pm PDT


September 30, 2am - October 2, 7:59am BST


September 30, 3am - October 2, 8:59am CET





In Smash the Star, you&#x27;ll compete in a team deathmatch mode where the rules change as challengers are knocked out. Happy Bath Survival — what a name —whittles teams away into a last-team-standing affair.


If you choose to go all in earlier, your progress in the Foamstars open beta won&#x27;t carry over to the game&#x27;s full release. It&#x27;s also only available for folks on PlayStation 5, though the multiplayer shooter will launch for the PS4, also. 


Today&#x27;s State of Play ushered in a handful of new announcements, like a demo for Ghostrunner 2 out today and a look at Sony&#x27;s new PlayStation controller offerings. However, Square Enix still stole the show with its update on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, showing off brand-new footage and a fancy collector&#x27;s edition featuring the series&#x27; best-conditioned baddie, Sephiroth.

                              <span>As part of the September 14, 2023 State of Play, Sony has revealed the release date for the anticipated Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. It will be releasing on PS5 February 29, 2024. Just a little under four years since the release of Final Fantasy VII: Remake.


The announcement comes with a new trailer that shows a nice mix of old and new. Vincent shows up, but we only see the back of his really epic mullet. We get a peak at Junon, which is looking pretty fly. Tifa also mentions weapons, the optional bosses from the original version. The Golden Saucer makes an appearance alongside Chocobo Racing.




Cloud rides around on a Segway while wearing a pastel-colored polo shirt. I don&#x27;t remember that happening in the PS1 title, but my memory is more perforated than a tea bag. There&#x27;s a bunch of other stuff that happens, but I don&#x27;t want to say anything confidently in case I just imagined it.


It&#x27;s some good stuff, nonetheless. I always felt that Final Fantasy VII got a lot of mileage out of its style, even when the story was sometimes a bit lacking. The remakes go a long way in preserving that while also making the world feel a bit more grounded.


Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth launches on PS5 on February 29, 2024.

                              <span>During the September 2023 State of Play, PlayStation revealed that Helldivers 2 has been delayed from October 2023 to February 8, 2024. The third-person co-op shooter is the sequel to Helldivers that originally released on PS3, PS4, and PlayStation Vita. We also got a new gameplay trailer that showed off the co-op mission-based gameplay of Helldivers 2.




Helldivers 2 is making the transition from top-down 2D to third-person 3D. In the video we see a group of four working together to fight a savage Bile Titan enemy, where communication is key. The scripted back-and-forth banter is always a bit corny to me. Let&#x27;s be real, no one actually talks like that in the gaming heat of battle. But still, the gameplay looks pretty solid and if there&#x27;s meaningful progression I&#x27;m definitely down to drop into Helldivers 2 next year.


Helldivers 2 will release on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on February 8, 2024.

                              <span>To beat a difficult game, you need to take it one step at a time. And next summer in Baby Steps, you&#x27;ll need to take that advice very, very literally.


Shown during today&#x27;s State of Play, Baby Steps is the latest physics-and-coordination game from Bennett Foddy, Gabe Cuzzillo, and Maxi Boch. You might remember Foddy from classics like QWOP or Getting Over It. Well, Baby Steps certainly looks to be carrying forward that legacy.




As the player character struggles to navigate even basic terrain without tripping over their ankles, this really does look like an enjoyably frustrating experience. The added humor might be make-or-break for you, though I personally dig it. I&#x27;m really most intrigued by the different obstacles though, especially that skateboard. It&#x27;s a set-up built for all kinds of mishaps.


I think you know if you want these kinds of experiences or not, just at a glance. For me, I&#x27;m down; and even if you don&#x27;t want to play Baby Steps, it&#x27;s probably one to watch your favorite streamer play anyways.


We also got a mildly updated release window for Baby Steps, as the trippy antics aim for Summer 2024.

                              <span>At the Sony State of Play, we got to see titles both old and new. While Honkai: Star Rail has already made its debut earlier this year, we got confirmation today that PlayStation owners can experience MiHoYo&#x27;s latest universe on October 11.




The trailer itself didn&#x27;t show too much, but considering the game&#x27;s out in the wild, it probably didn&#x27;t need to. According to MiHoYo&#x27;s FAQ for the Technical Test of the PlayStation version of the game, accounts will transfer between devices. So for those looking to play Star Rail both at home via your PlayStation 5 and on the go on your phone, things look pretty good.


Honkai: Star Rail is currently available for free with microtransactions on PC, iOS, and Android.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the sequel to 2020&#x27;s Final Fantasy VII Remake, will hit PlayStation 5 on February 29, 2024. This follows news from Summer Game Fest back in June where Square Enix announced Rebirth will require two discs and launch in &quot;early 2024.&quot; 
Alongside news of Rebirth&#x27;s release date, Square Enix and PlayStation also released a new and expansive trailer during today&#x27;s State of Play. In it, we get our first looks at characters like Cait Sith, Vincent Valentine, and more. We also get to see The Gold Saucer, some fun minigames inspired by the visual style of Final Fantasy VII on PS1, and more of the game&#x27;s open area exploration, which features ridable chocobos, vehicles, and segways.

                              <span>Today’s State of Play offered our latest look at Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. The new trailer doubles down on the impressive visuals we’ve already come to expect from the game, with a colorful natural palette that looks like a gorgeous place to explore.
We also got a glimpse of a player’s ability to ride and interact with a variety of Pandora’s alien creatures – clearly a highlight of the gameplay.
Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, and is headed for release in just a few months, on December 7 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

The city has doubled in size
Web wings (which we have seen before) allow for even faster traversal
Peter Parker&#x27;s old high-school is a location you can visit, as well as Miles Morales&#x27; Visions Academy
You will be able to swap between Parker Spider-Man and Morales Spider-Man almost instantly
New U.I. options and more visually interesting tasks to do around the city will, hopefully, prevent you from using the menus too much
Parker and Morales can user a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man app
Folks will make requests for Spider-Man&#x27;s help. Sometimes they want a specific Spider-Man, often they don&#x27;t care
There is a new fast-travel system
There are over 65 suits to unlock and wear

Spider-Man 2 releases October 20 on PlayStation 5. Keep an eye on our website tomorrow for even more from the game, including hands-on impressions.</span>

                              <span>Today, during Sony&#x27;s recent State of Play livestream, we got a look at both the upcoming PSVR2 update and story DLC for the Resident Evil 4 Remake. 
The VR trailer is brief but does show the game in action. Much like the other VR port of RE4, the move brings the whole game into virtual reality. The big news is that the update is coming this winter.


More immediately, we finally got confirmation that &quot;Separate Ways&quot; is coming to RE4. For the uninitiated, Separate Ways was a side campaign starring, you guessed it, Ada Wong, initially released with the PlayStation 2 and all subsequent versions of the original Resident Evil 4. Separate Ways will be released next week, on September 21.
Moreover, Both Ada Wong and Albert Wesker will be made available as playable characters in the Mercenaries game mode.
For more Resident Evil 4 Remake, check out our review.
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified &quot;Separate Ways&quot; as &quot;Assignment Ada.&quot; We regret the error.</span>

                              <span>Bennett Foddy, the developer behind Getting Over It, released another trailer for Baby Steps during today&#x27;s PlayStation State of Play. Foddy, along with fellow developers Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch, are bringing Baby Steps to PlayStation 5 next summer. 
Today&#x27;s trailer stopped short of revealing a more exact release date, though. Baby Steps was revealed during a June PlayStation State of Play earlier this year. In it, players control Nate, an &quot;unemployed failson with nothing going for him until one day, he discovers a power he never knew he had: putting one foot in front of the other.&quot; And as you might expect, players will control Nate on his journey to discover more of the world around him. 
Check out the new Baby Steps trailer for yourself below:


Baby Steps will hit PlayStation 5 and PC during the summer of 2024.</span>

                              <span>Immortals of Aveum hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC just weeks ago. We had a great time with it, giving it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Today, developer Ascendant Studios laid off approximately 45 percent of its staff. 
Ascendant founder and CEO Bret Robbins released a statement on Twitter today, explaining the large reduction in staff. He says it was a painfully difficult decision but a necessary one following the release of Immortals of Aveum on August 22. Here’s Robbins’ statement in full:

The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone affected by these layoffs and those still at the studio. 
These layoffs follow the release of Immortals of Aveum, a game we thoroughly enjoyed, on August 22. Before its launch, we went hands-on with Immortals of Aveum at Ascendant Studios and talked with the team about creating a new first-person shooter in Unreal Engine 5.</span>

                              <span>Another Code: Two Memories, or Trace Memory as it&#x27;s known in North America, is a Nintendo DS game that launched on the handheld device way back in 2005. Its sequel, Another Code: R – Journey Into Lost Memories, launched on the Wii in 2009, but it never came to North America. Now, players can experience both games when Another Code: Recollection hits Switch in January. 
Another Code: Recollection is an enhanced collection of Trace Memory and Another Code: R launching on Switch on January 19, 2024. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed this collection of games with a new trailer showing enhanced visuals while pulling back the curtains on protagonist Ashley, who is traveling to the remote Blood Edward Island in search of her father. 
Check out the Another Code: Recollection reveal trailer for yourself below: 


After Ashley receives a letter from her father, who she believes to be dead, a chain of mysteries and visions from the past is set off, sending her to Blood Edward Island. There, Ashley must investigate her surroundings while solving puzzles to reveal the truth. Another Code: R completes Ashley&#x27;s tale. In it, she journeys to Lake Juliet two years after the events of Trace Memory to uncover the hidden truth surrounding her mother. 
&quot;This collection includes fully enhanced versions of both original games, featuring overhauled visuals, fully explorable environments, new voice acting, puzzles, music, and more,&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s description of the game reads. &quot;Optional hint and navigation systems have been added to help players new to adventure games.&quot; 
Another Code: Recollection will cost $59.99 and launch on Switch on January 19, 2024.

                              <span>Dave the Diver has been one of the sleeper hits of the very busy year of video games that 2023 has been so far and continues to be. Dave the Diver hit PC earlier this year but now, developer Mintrocket has revealed the sushi restaurant management game will hit Switch next month. 
More specifically, Dave the Diver will launch on Switch on October 26, and it will do so with Switch-exclusive bonuses, but only for those who preorder.


The game will cost $19.99 on Switch and you can preorder it on the Nintendo eShop right now. You can also check out a demo of the game on Switch right now, too. Preordering the game before its release will get you a bonus skin for Dave&#x27;s boat and an exclusive lamp decoration for the sushi restaurant. Mintrocket describes the boat skin as nostalgic and themed after an 8-bit visual style, whereas the lamp depicts Dave &quot;in [a] charming retro style.&quot; 
&quot;We&#x27;re over the moon seeing and hearing the reception to our first game,&quot; Dave the Diver game director Jaeho Hwang writes in a press release. &quot;Bringing this to the Switch community has been an important goal for us as we think the console is a home where the players will truly appreciate everything Dave the Diver has to offer.&quot; 
For the uninitiated, Dave the Diver tasks players with diving underwater to gather ingredients by day that are used to serve hungry customers at a seaside sushi restaurant at night. However, there&#x27;s a mystery bubbling up from &quot;the deepest depths of the Blue Hole, the setting that [Dave] will swim through in this incredible journey.&quot; 
Dave the Diver is currently available on PC. It hits Switch on October 26. 
While waiting for its Switch release, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dave the Diver review.

                              <span>Developer Robotality and publisher Chucklefish have announced that Wargroove 2 will be released next month. More specifically, the sequel hits Switch and PC on October 5, just a few months shy of the first Wargroove&#x27;s fourth anniversary. 
Chucklefish announced the Wargroove 2 release date during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct alongside a new trailer showing more of the game&#x27;s beautiful pixel art and challenging turn-based combat. It also highlighted the new commanders to control, a new playable faction in Wargroove 2, and the sequel&#x27;s three interweaving campaigns. 
Check out the Wargroove 2 release date trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, this new trailer reveals the Faahri Republic, which Chucklefish describes as &quot;a nation of curious mouse-folk who have landed in Aurania on a scholarly expedition.&quot;
&quot;What the Faahri Republic lacks in military experience, they more than make up for with academic theory,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Equipped with mysterious crystal technology, Commanders Lytra, Pistil, and Rhomb must work together in pursuit of information for their mysterious benefactors.&quot; 
Elsewhere in the press release, Chucklefish says Wargroove 2 features new recruits and veteran wardogs to control alongside the game&#x27;s new commanders. You can supercharge those commanders with a newly updated Groove system, too. Once you&#x27;re done with Wargroove 2&#x27;s three campaign arcs, you can battle with or against friends in co-op and multiplayer modes, both locally and online, with up to three other players. 

Preorders for Wargroove 2 are now live on PC and Switch. On Steam and Nintendo Europe and North American eShops, you can preorder for 20% off today. The game&#x27;s full price is $19.99.
Wargroove 2 hits Switch and PC next month on October 5.

                              <span>Vanillaware released 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim in 2020, and it was a bit of a sleeper hit. However, this team is also behind other games like Dragon&#x27;s Crown and Odin Sphere. Now, Vanillaware has announced Unicorn Overlord, a new tactical fantasy RPG, and it launches March 8 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 as a digital-only game, and Switch.
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the team announced this new game with a trailer showcasing its various characters, unique art style, and tactics gameplay. And perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks great. 
Check out the Unicorn Overlord reveal trailer for yourself below: 


Vanillaware says Unicorn Overlord combines overworld exploration with an innovative battle system that&#x27;s very reminiscent of Vanillaware&#x27;s combat style. In the game, you&#x27;ll &quot;traverse the vibrant world, cultivate a grand army with over 60 uniquely designed characters, and grow your renown throughout the five nations in this unique epic fantasy experience.&quot; 
In addition to a Standard Edition of Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware will also release a Collector&#x27;s Edition that includes a physical copy of the game, a premium box, a 16-bit BGM soundtrack CD that consists of two discs with 10 tracks on each, a 132-page artbook, and an original card game for Unicorn Overlord that includes 239 cards, tokens, and markers. The Collector&#x27;s Edition also includes the &quot;Atlus x Vanillaware Heraldry pack and preorder DLC, which lets you customize the Liberation Army’s flag with emblem designs from Odin Sphere, Dragon&#x27;s Crown, and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim.&quot; 
Unicorn Overlord launches on March 8, 2024, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 (digital only), and Switch.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the company announced release dates and windows for some highly anticipated Amiibo figures, namely, the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the Noah and Mio Amiibo for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for his inclusion on the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster. 
All five Amiibo look great, as Nintendo has especially become great at making these figures compared to the first few runs of Amiibo. Nintendo announced that the Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo for Tears of the Kingdom were coming back in June, and now we know exactly when: both hit stores on November 3. While the two figures were announced together, each will be sold individually. Each Amiibo unlocks a special fabric for your paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom and special materials and weapons for the game. 
The Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Noah and Mio Amiibo go live on January 19, 2024. These two will be released as a single set. The Noah Amiibo gets you Consul N’s Armor for Noah in-game and the Leisure Time outfits for Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. The Mio Amiibo unlocks Consul M’s Armor for Mio and Leisure Time outfits for Mio, Sena, and Taion. 
And finally, the Kingdom Hearts Sora Amiibo for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will join the figure lineup sometime in 2024. 
While waiting to get each, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and then read Game Informer&#x27;s review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. After that, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

Supergiant announced Hades II during The Video Game Awards 2022 last December, with plans to launch it into Early Access. This is the same strategy they took with the first Hades before its critically acclaimed 1.0 launch in 2020 on PC and Switch and 2021 on PlayStation and Xbox. Now, roughly nine months later, Supergiant has released a development update about the highly anticipated sequel, which is where it revealed the Q2 2024 Early Access launch window.

                              <span>Bloomberg reports that two Unity Technologies Inc. offices closed today following a &quot;credible death threat&quot; amidst ongoing controversy regarding a new per-install fee implemented for developers using Unity. The company also canceled a planned town hall, according to Bloomberg. 
Two days ago, Unity revealed plans to charge developers using the Unity video game engine a per-install fee that would be enacted every time a player installed their games. Developers were quick to point out issues with this per-install fee, like players&#x27; ability to install, delete, install, rinse, and repeat to cost developers money as a form of retaliation, amongst other things. Many developers publicly called for Unity to walk back these changes. While Unity has addressed some of the concerns, developers are still wary of trusting the company moving forward, with some developers signaling they might move development to completely different engines in light of this fee. 
Unity CEO John Riccitiello had plans to address company staff during a town hall this morning but instead canceled it and closed the company&#x27;s Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, offices as a result of death threats Unity received it perceived to be credible.

                              <span>NCSoft has announced that Battle Crush, its upcoming battle royale brawler, is coming to Nintendo Switch in addition to the previously known PC and mobile release. On top of that, the company revealed that all versions will receive a closed beta test next month, complete with crossplay.
In Battle Crush, players choose a character and fight to be the strongest of a pool of 30 players as the ground collapses around them. Due to ever-encroaching waves of enemies and unique battle arenas, players must be thoughtful with their placement and strategies. The player characters, called Calixers, cover a wide range of influences, often drawing inspiration from mythological figures. Battle royale may be the main mode, but Battle Crush also offers Brawl mode, where a player chooses three Calixers to fight with on a smaller map, and Build-Up, a one-on-one mode where two players compete for a best-of-five series.
Players can sign up for Battle Crush&#x27;s closed beta test, which is slated to run from October 23 through October 30 on Switch, PC, and Android. Battle Crush is currently planned to launch in spring 2024.</span>

The 2020 launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was terrible. Anticipation reached a point that no reasonable game could meet. Cyberpunk could have potentially grappled with those lofty expectations, but the major problem was its technical proficiency – or lack thereof. Despite the game getting good reviews (a product of press only being given PC copies) for most players, the game crashed frequently or was riddled with bugs. The PlayStation 4 version was pulled from shelves and taken offline. The content of the game – the story, the characters, the mechanics – was barely discussed in the face of players struggling even to explore the neon-soaked streets of Night City. It was a disaster, and fingers were pointed in many directions at…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this summer, Nintendo revealed WarioWare: Move It, a new game set in the long-running &quot;microgame&quot; series. Ahead of its release later this year in November, Nintendo released a new trailer for WarioWare: Move It during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. In it, we learned more about its various microgames and what a &quot;Form&quot; is. 
Forms are the specific poses players must perform during microgames. You might have to squat down and flap your arms, like a chicken, to push an egg out of your virtual WarioWare: Move It avatar, for example. In these microgames, you&#x27;ll need to perform the correct action while in the right form as quick as you can. And you&#x27;ll need to do so quickly because Nintendo says microgames come one after another in quick succession. 
Check these WarioWare: Move It microgames out for yourself in the trailer below: 


Eslewhere in today&#x27;s trailer, we learned more about WarioWare: Move It&#x27;s Party Mode, which will allow up to four players to compete against each other. You might have to reach a goal without getting caught by Medusa&#x27;s gaze, for example, or settle a score in an arena to be the last one posing. 
Between Party Mode and the single-player modes of WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo says there are over 200 microgames to play through. 
WarioWare: Move It hits Switch November 3.

For the most part, it seems to be largely the same game you played back on the Nintendo 3DS – albeit with much better graphics. We got a first look at gameplay today, too, which you can see in the full trailer below.


Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 – originally called Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon in the United States – was first released back in March 2013.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s been 30 years since the release of the original F-Zero, and as a tribute, Nintendo is creating a new version of the beloved racer. F-Zero 99 is a battle royale version of the game, similar to other recent Switch experiments like Tetris 99 and Mario 35. Check out the reveal trailer below.


The game will take place on classic F-Zero courses with machines from the original SNES game, and as the name implies, it will support up to 99 players at once. In addition to beating the competition, you&#x27;ll have to avoid running into obstacles to keep from exploding. You can also complete missions to unlock new cosmetic options to customize your machine.

                              <span>Earlier this summer, Nintendo announced that Princess Peach was getting her own game. At the time, they referred to the project as Untitled Princess Peach Game but during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, the company revealed its official name: Princess Peach Showtime! 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch early next year on March 22. Alongside the reveal of the game&#x27;s name and its release date, Nintendo also shared new details about what to expect. Princess Peach and some Toads took a trip to the Sparkle Theater to see a play. But when the Wicked Grape and the Sour Bunch arrive, it&#x27;s up to Princess Peach to save the day . 
Check it out for yourself in the Princess Peach Showtime trailer below:


Princess Peach hops onto the stage with the help of Sparkle Theater guardian Stella to take down the Sour Bunch and hopefully, their leader, Wicked Grape. To do that, Princess Peach will have to make her way through a variety of plays, transforming along the way. We see her become Swordfighter Peach, with a Muskateer-esque outfit to go with it. As Swordfighter Peach, she can use a rapier to take down the Sour Bunch and other enemies before her. But that&#x27;s just one play. 
Today&#x27;s trailer also revealed Princess Peach will become Detective Peach to determine who is stealing artifacts from a museum. We also see her become Patisserie Peach in an effort to find stolen desserts, and Kung Fu Peach to stop the Sour Bunch from taking over a martial arts school. 

This was just a taste of the transformations that await in Princess Peach Showtime, too. 
Princess Peach Showtime hits Switch on March 22, 2024.

First, Action Commands will increase the damage dealt or reduce how much damage you take. If you time your attacks just right, you&#x27;re able to damage all enemies at the same time. A gauge in the lower left corner of the screen will fill with every Action Command, which can be used for a Triple Move, which combines the attacks of all three characters in your party. 
You can see the whole thing in action here:


Super Mario RPG will be released on November 17.</span>

                              <span>Splatoon 3 entered the Switch&#x27;s library with a splash last year, but Nintendo isn&#x27;t done supporting the squid-based shooter just yet. Today, we got a new look at wave 2 of the game&#x27;s expansion pack, titled Side Order. You can watch the trailer below.


The trailer takes place at the foot of the Spire of Order, a new location largely devoid of color. We see the return of Agent 8, the protagonist from Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion interact with a new character named Acht (which is notably German for the word &quot;eight&quot;), who claims to go &quot;way back&quot; with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Meanwhile, Pearl, her co-host, seems to be embodying a robot that accompanies Agent 8 throughout the world.
Acht gives Agent 8 color chips that modify their abilities, like increasing certain damage types or boosting run speed. After the trailer, Takahashi mentioned that the DLC was designed to be played &quot;over and over again,&quot; possibly implying the game will have roguelike elements. You can check it out yourself when Side Order hits the eShop in spring 2024. For more on Splatoon 3, you can read about the original DLC announcement here, or check out our review of the game.</span>

                              <span>Další publikace z Edice CZ.NIC, správce české národní domény, má název Micro:bit krok za krokem. Jejím autorem je Martin Malý. Kniha je určena jak pro naprosté začátečníky, kteří se teprve s Micro:bitem a programováním seznamují, tak i pro pokročilejší uživatele, kteří už mají zkušenosti s elektronikou a programováním. Rozdíl proti předchozím titulům je ten, že tentokrát knihu neprodává CZ.NIC, prodávají ji distributoři (knihkupci), a to včetně e-booku. Z tohoto důvodu nedává CZ.NIC na svůj web zatím ke stažení e-book zdarma, jako u předchozích titulů, ale půl roku nechává distributorům exkluzivitu na prodej, a teprve poté nabídne PDF zdarma.</span>

The release date was announced today as part of a developer stream, which also included a new cinematic trailer for the expansion featuring a little of Idris Elba&#x27;s character before the events of the game.

                              <span>I bought a Steam Deck thinking I would delight in being able to play the breadth and depth of PC gaming away from my desk. Then I downloaded arcade racer Horizon Chase Turbo and basically played nothing else. It was fast, accessible, a throwback to the Amiga racers of my youth, and perfect for sneaking in between work meetings and emails.

Now its sequel Horizon Chase 2 is out on PC... but only via the Epic Games Store. Damn.

                              <span>I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve been itching to return to Amnesia: The Bunker, Frictional&#x27;s perfectly ghastly blend of horror game and immersive sim, but I&#x27;ve certainly been itching to write about it. The terrible beauty of that generator-based exploration and scavenging loop. That moment when you walk just a little too quickly down a corridor, and hear the awful rummaging in the walls. The agonising discovery that not only is it possible to roam with the lights out, but pretty much required, beyond a certain point. The dense burden of grasping more or less where to go, without knowing how to survive the journey - and above all else, those goddamn rats, always encountered where least convenient. Shoo! Shoo!
It&#x27;s by far the most oppressive and demanding horror game I&#x27;ve played in recent memory, and it&#x27;ll get considerably worse with the release of the Halloween update.

                              <span>On paper, Final Fantasy XIV doesn’t do a very good job of encouraging fishing. FFXIV’s lead director and producer Naoki Yoshida — known as Yoshi P — wanted to create something that was &quot;fun, but relaxing”, and there aren’t a lot of material rewards for the time you put in. You can sell the fish or break them down into other materials, but really the only reason to fish is for the sake of fishing itself. 

And yet today Final Fantasy XIV is home to a close knit fishing community of over 27,000 people. This single shared interest has spun off into many different directions, including fishing as a competitive journey, the process of building a space for the hobby itself, and even a kind of metagame. But the main thread tying these all together is the love for fishing, and the community’s central hub is actually located outside of the game - in a Discord server called Fisherman’s Horizon, lovingly nicknamed Fishcord.

                              <span>Unity staff have been sent threats in the wake of the controversial unveiling of a new pricing structure for Unity games. The company have now closed several of their offices to protect employees, and a law enforcement investigation is underway.


&quot;Hey y&#x27;all, just a reminder to think before you target Unity employees,&quot; senior XR product designer Javier Busto tweeted earlier today. &quot;This morning we learned that law enforcement notified several Unity offices of credible threats. This fucking sucks.&quot;

                              <span>There comes a point in every diary playthrough when the Comet of Invention meets the Cowpat of Diminishing Returns, when the Foot of Agency meets the Covert Hedgehog of Limited Design, when Fucking Around meets Finding Not Much Out. I fear we are reaching that point with the life and times of Mary Read, my Starfield character and nowadays quite accomplished space pirate, who has sworn never to land on a planet ever again. 


Immediately after conquering the Chimera in Part 2 of the Starfield No-Planet Run, I commandeered a UC Longsword II on the other side of the same system. The Longsword has proven a predator without equal, charging straight through opposing craft even when they&#x27;ve got several levels on me, its unforgiving autocannons forming the dominant bassline of every encounter. Frankly, it&#x27;s getting repetitive, and while the obvious remedy is to plunge cackling and crying into a star system with an AI threat level in the high double digits, I doubt that will really alter the rhythms of Starfield&#x27;s ship combat - it&#x27;ll just mean I have to do some grinding.

Plus, Nate has been playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and has thoughts about it, so that&#x27;s double SEO juice for this episode.
There&#x27;s double beans metaphors this week, and James talks about the latest Steam Decklike, the Lenovo Legion go, which is like if a portable PC made love to a Switch, kind of. Some fun recommendations this week, too, especially if you like cathedrals.

Anyway, I like a kick, and I like a game that manages to actually be funny, and I have been playing Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands. You do the math(s).
I actually wrote about Deathbulge in a round up of best demos in a Steam Next Fest back in 2020, at which time I enjoyed the RPG antics of a band entering a cursed Battle Of The Bands competition and finding out that it&#x27;s a fight to the death. The full thing came out a month ago without my noticing, and got past the endpoint of the demo. It&#x27;s fun! I&#x27;m enjoying the combat, which is both real-time and turn-based, and has some surprisingly deep tactics attached to it. But more importantly, the full Deathbulge game starts in a town where you enter houses by kicking doors in.

A sparkling sliver of Swiss Army handheld design, providing a familiar taste of desktop play that the Steam Deck or Asus ROG Ally could never achieve without a USB dock.
Turns out, now that I’ve tried the Legion Go for myself, I was worried about the wrong thing. It’s nowhere near as heavy or cumbersome as it looks, and while the breakaway controls remain an exciting prospect, they also risk introducing an acute pain point. At the very least, the model I tested proved highly vulnerable to lead-handed RPS hardware editors, because I left the building very much with the impression that I’d broken it.

                              <span>As gaming at large gorges itself on a feast of fantastic titles, PCVR crawls beneath the table licking up the crumbs. There are tasty treats simmering in the kitchen, like the remake of The 7th Guest and sequels to I Expect You To Die and Arizona Sunshine, but right now all the fine dining is happening on Quest and PSVR2, covering which would involve running my thumb under RPS&#x27; hermetic PC seal.


In my desperation, I&#x27;ve turned to golf, something I would never consider under normal circumstances. I feel about golf the same way I feel about the UK Conservative party, insofar as both occupy space that would be better filled with trees. But I haven&#x27;t gone totally tartan slacks. We&#x27;re only entering the realm of minigolf, which I am more positively inclined toward. It lacks the pretensions and exclusionary nature of its bigger, paunchier cousin. Anybody can rock up to a minigolf course with a putter and nobody will sneer at you for being shit at it. It&#x27;s also small and inherently naff, traits I can likewise relate to.

                              <span>After a couple of days of furious game developer reactions, game engine company Unity have backtracked a teensy bit on their plan to charge developers who meet certain revenue and copies-sold thresholds a &quot;runtime fee&quot; for every installation of their game.
The company will only make developers pay extra for the first installation of a game on a new device - so no fees for reinstallations, in theory, and no prospect of spiteful players &quot;install bombing&quot; games to drive up costs for their creators. However, the company haven&#x27;t stated how or indeed, if they can distinguish legitimate from illegitimate installations in advance, seemingly because their method for tracking installations is based on &quot;estimates&quot; using a proprietary data-gathering system, which they aren&#x27;t able to discuss in depth.

Minecraft! After a month reporting on the barren planets of Starfield and plundering the rather more involving dungeons of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, it&#x27;s almost steadying to remember that these supposed titans are but momentary flickers, transient particles in the sunken Creeper eyesocket of Mojang&#x27;s behemoth. And what a time to rediscover the game. Vanilla Minecraft has always felt like an autumnal creation to me, even before they added all the pumpkin heads - a game of long nights and campfires, with an ambience derived from Tove Jansson&#x27;s Moomin books. Anyway, here&#x27;s the teaser trailer for Minecraft Live.

The long rumoured and expected September Nintendo Direct has been and gone like a flash of lightning, and those 40 minutes certainly flew by for us.
The dust is settling and while we&#x27;re fully ready to share our overexcited thoughts, let&#x27;s round up some of the highlights. Splatoon 3&#x27;s DLC, Side Order, is coming in Spring 2024 and it looks pretty darn amazing. the GBA and DS are having a moment right now with remakes of Mario vs. Donkey Kong and Another Code (a bundle which contains both the DS original and the Wii sequel). Princess Peach&#x27;s new video game finally has a title — Princess Peach: Showtime! - and a release date of March 2024. And Wave 6 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s DLC is bringing back some fan-favourite characters this winter.

Surprise, RPG fans! Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes has an actual release date. The upcoming RPG from Yoshitaka Murayama, the creator of the Suikoden series, is launching on Nintendo Switch and other consoles on 23rd April 2024.
Today&#x27;s announcement during the Nintendo Direct came as a bit of a surprise to us. Accompanied by a new trailer, this release date comes just almost two months after Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios had to delay the game to Q2 2024. April falls right in that window, of course, but we&#x27;re still surprised to get a date so soon.

                              <span>Matcha the mood.
As a series, Pokémon is one that has held onto tradition pretty firmly. In the 25+ years since Red &amp; Blue’s release, the fundamentals of the game haven’t really changed – you explore a world, you fight Pokémon, you catch Pokémon. Last year’s Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet was the mainline series’ first big attempt to change things up a bit, expanding exploration to an open-world setting and letting you progress in your own way. But fundamentally it was still Pokémon, warts and all.
It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the first part of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC, The Teal Mask, is set in a land besotted with tradition. The people tell folk tales, new native Pokémon are steeped in history, and with the Kitakami region&#x27;s clear Japanese inspirations, it feels like a throwback to the older days. This does mean that while The Teal Mask is a fun time that builds on Scarlet &amp; Violet’s strengths, it also exposes the base game&#x27;s – and the series’ – weaknesses that much more.

                              <span>Seeing stars.
Square Enix has dropped a surprise demo for Star Ocean The Second Story R on Switch, and other consoles, today.

The third full Nintendo Direct of 2023 has come and gone. The September 2023 presentation might have lacked the tentpole megaton announcements some fans were waiting for, but it was a slow-burn showcase with some huge news for the Nintendo faithful (Thousand-Year Door remake? A new-ish F-Zero?!).
Below you&#x27;ll find the video of the full Nintendo Direct September 2023 presentation, plus every individual game announcement with trailers, and some official blurb or a link to our more detailed coverage. There&#x27;s also a poll at the bottom, so let us know your personal highlights from this showcase!

n a Nintendo Direct full of nostalgia, remakes, and returning Nintendo IPs, one of the highlights was a brand new strategy RPG from Japanese developer Vanillware — Unicorn Overlord.
When the trailer dropped and we saw the studio&#x27;s stunning hand-drawn visuals, we knew we were in for a treat, and when the gameplay kicked in, we couldn&#x27;t help but think of the Ogre Battle series. there will be over 60 unique characters to recruit and build up an army to help you fight against fate — a daunting prospect, for sure, so you&#x27;ll need all of the help you can get.

Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were arrested in Argentina, where they are currently &#x27;home confined’ pending their extradition battle. Meanwhile, their lawyers are trying to convince a New York federal court to dismiss the case for a myriad of reasons.

                              <span>There’s something that feels oddly momentous about sending one of Dune: Spice Wars’ harvesters to get to work worm-dodging while hoovering up MSG (magical space glitter). It was, after all, Dune II’s implementation of these trucks that are largely responsible for the shape of the entire RTS genre. I’ve mused before that if you count Alien as something that wouldn’t exist without Dune, along with the effects the RTS had on esports, it&#x27;s wild to consider how different gaming could have been if Frank Herbert hadn’t visited Florence in 1957 to chronicle a natural phenomenon. It’s one heck of a butterfly effect, which is fitting, because Spice Wars itself can often feel like a creative exploration of how integral butterfly effects are to grand strategy rulesets. Forget those harvesters for a moment, because this dry but undeniably captivating 4X is all about the steamroll.

                              <span>You can’t fault the pitch. In Gunbrella you’re a sort of cowboy dude with a shotgun that’s also an umbrella. You use the umbrella to deflect enemy projectiles, block attacks, fly up into the air like a furious Mary Poppins and zoom along ziplines. You use the shotgun, as you might reasonably expect, to do the majority of your big murdering.


Gunbrella is a classic 2D platform shooter in the style of a steampunk western. It’s like Deadwood crossed with Singin’ In The Rain, if Gene Kelly ever used his umbrella to blow holes through anyone who didn’t sufficiently praise his tap dancing. Some light exploration bits have you travelling by train from frontier towns to mining villages, much of them decorated with giant spinning cogs – so you know it’s steampunk – and populated by a small cast of quest-giving locals, pill-dispensing shopkeepers and monologuing villains.

                              <span>One of my favourite TV shows is The Rookie, because you never have any idea what could happen next. No episode can go more than five minutes without some kind of twist, often with no relation to anything that has happened up until that point. Like, you think the stand-off between criminals and their victims in a courthouse nuclear bunker has been resolved, but it turns out that while the camera was off him, a lawyer got stabbed by someone else. Hauma is bringing that kind of energy to the visual novel space. 
You play as Judith, a former detective and champion boxer who&#x27;s wrapped up in solving the case her grandfather was working on before he died. On its face, Hauma is therefore a detective game in a pretty cool 2D comic book-style, with a slightly worse version of the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes mind palace as your inventory of clues, which you combine to logic your way through puzzles. But at the point where you&#x27;re in a tunnel under the ruins of a Nazi temple in Munich, having discovered that the MacGuffin is a shin bone carved with the recipe for an eternal life drink (which was stolen by some nuns and taken to Bavaria, and then the nuns all got pregnant I guess?) - and, secondly, having recently survived a massive explosion at an Oktoberfest beer tent - you kind of think, well, things have gotten quite out of hand, haven&#x27;t they?

                              <span>Cor, has it really been almost half a year since we&#x27;ve done one of these? Apologies, readers. I honestly don&#x27;t know where the time goes. It&#x27;s probably because we&#x27;re spending too much time with our favourite guilty pleasure games, which is the subject of this latest Ask RPS column.  
The question comes courtesy of ronzilla, who asked: What were your favourite guilty pleasure games of 2022? As in, I play this all the time and I&#x27;m semi-embarrassed to admit it? 
A good question! In canvassing the wider RPS Treehouse for their responses, it quickly became clear that most of our guilty pleasure games extend way beyond the bounds of just the year 2022, so we&#x27;ve answered a bit more broadly than the original question perhaps intended. Still, hopefully there are still some entertaining answers in here nonetheless.

Your aunt was indoctrinated into fascism by a page called “This country used to have real bin men” after she liked a meme about glass milk bottles in 2012. Every boy you went to school with has a podcast about football now. Your Mam once warned you about spending too much time on the computer but now spends eight hours a day playing Hay Day on her phone. AI was meant to let us lie in fields and read books, but instead it’s being used to show you what Breaking Bad would have looked like as an anime.
But it didn’t used to be like this! Obviously I don’t need to remind our regular readers about the glory days of the information superhighway because some of you are old enough to be my Dad (and I’m thirty-one) but just in case a member of Gen Z has stumbled upon this article by accident: the internet used to be fun. Like, really fun, and Hypnospace Outlaw is living proof of it.

Lies of P developer Neowiz proudly calls its The Adventures of Pinocchio-inspired action game a Soulslike, drawing direct attention to its From Software inspiration. The proclamation is a bold and risky move. While there are great contenders in this action subgenre, even the best are a few marks from what From Software creates and I went into Lies of P with that expectation. But then I put 40 hours into Lies of P in just five days, something I rarely do with any game. And then I doubled back on a save to get …</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has consistently been a fan of airing Nintendo Directs during September, with the usual September Directs being some of the most exciting of the year. And the company will continue that streak in 2023 as it has announced a Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, September 14.
The company revealed this on Twitter today, stating that the direct will run for &quot;roughly 40&quot; minutes at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET on September 14. 
Tune in on Sept. 14 at 7 a.m. PT for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information focused on #NintendoSwitch games releasing this winter.

As for what to expect, there&#x27;s a lot of unknowns circling this Direct. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the big upcoming release from Nintendo, but that just got its own dedicated direct last month. That&#x27;s the same direct where we learned Nintendo was releasing a new Mario Red OLED Switch, too. 
Detective Pikachu Returns is another big Switch exclusive releasing next month, and it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll see more of it during this Direct. We just went hands-on with it last week and you can read our impressions of that here. There&#x27;s plenty more coming to Switch in the last few months of 2023, too, but admittedly, exclusives are sparse. September Directs from Nintendo usually give players a look ahead at the next year so we&#x27;re hoping to learn more about the company&#x27;s 2024 plans. Considering &quot;this winter&quot; dips into next year, it seems we will learn more about the early months of 2024.
On that note, Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last month, and other reports indicate this new console will be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024. Perhaps we&#x27;ll learn about it during this Direct. Only time will tell. 
This Nintendo Direct will air at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET and will run for roughly 40 minutes. 
What do you hope to see from this Nintendo Direct? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

Unity posted an FAQ on its forums to announce its changes, which will go into effect on January 1, 2024. 
&quot;[We will introduce a new Unity Runtime Fee that&#x27;s based on game installs,&quot; the forum post originally began. &quot;We will also add cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime at no extra cost to Unity subscription plans this November.&quot; It then links to its original announcement blog post and subsequent FAQ. 
Yesterday evening, a Unity spokesperson made an edit to the forum post, &quot;Highlighting some of the question/answer pairs from this thread [of forum users and developers concerned] below for visibility.&quot; 
Here are those question/answer pairs, in full:

                              <span>The next Sims game currently goes under the name Project Rene rather than The Sims 5, but that aside, we know a growing amount about EA Maxis&#x27; next social simulation. During today&#x27;s latest Behind The Sims community update, they shared more, including the news that the next entry in the series would be free-to-play and without energy mechanics or a subscription.

                              <span>The makers of game creation software Unity have announced a new pricing structure. They&#x27;re calling it the &quot;Unity Runtime Fee&quot;, and it means qualifying developers who use Unity will be charged an extra fee for each player that installs their game. 

In response to widespread criticism of the changes from game developers, Unity have since posted a further statement, saying, &quot;Yes, this is a price increase and it will only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users.&quot;

                              <span>While Starfield is the big sci-fi shooter on Game Pass right now, folks fancying shootier shooting should see another FPS owned by Bethesda: Quake 2. Id Software&#x27;s 1997 shooter was fancied up with a remaster released as a free update in August, complete with all the old stuff and one notable new addition. MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein games, have created a whole new story campaign for the remaster. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed playing it. It&#x27;s the old Quake 2 you know and have complicated feelings about, filtered through modern design sensibilities. I think both veterans and newcomers could enjoy blasting these biomechanical alien horrors.

It normally retails for around $40, but today it&#x27;s down to $33.99 at Amazon US. That&#x27;s not the best price we&#x27;ve ever seen, but it&#x27;s still great value for a mouse that remains in my personal rotation a few years after it first debuted.

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 outfit Remedy Entertainment have &quot;always&quot; felt pressured to make their games longer, creative director Sam Lake has observed in a new interview which also picks apart the differences between the forthcoming midwestern spookalot, out this October, and the 2010 original. Lake added that, Remedy&#x27;s sense of audience expectations notwithstanding, he himself has difficulty setting aside hours for longer games. &quot;[It&#x27;s] just struggling with finding time and you know, being interested in a story, wanting to see it through,&quot; he said. &quot;So it can even be daunting at times to start playing a game that you know is really, really long.&quot;

There&#x27;s also a physical limited edition coming to Europe on 23rd October, for those of you who revel in such things as portraits of faction leaders, packs of cosmetics and posters of the game&#x27;s campaign map, which you can also check out in the new campaign flyover video below.


In case you&#x27;re wondering, I&#x27;ve checked with the authorities and yes, PHARAOH should be written in all capitals, making a laughing stock of all previous RPS reporting. If it feels unnatural, try to imagine that you&#x27;re bellowing the game&#x27;s title from the summit of a pyramid, so as to remind your embattled subjects of your magnificence. RPS boss Katharine behaves similarly in morning meetings. &quot;EDITOR-IN-CHIEF,&quot; she roars at us repeatedly, until somebody rushes her the daily traffic reports, a steaming goblet of sphinx eggs and a gif of a crafty kill in Shadow Gambit.

                              <span>&quot;Usually, when a player is going through a strategy game, they figure out how things work by trial and error,&quot; Total War: Pharaoh&#x27;s game director Todor Nikolov tells me at this year&#x27;s Gamescom. &quot;And once they do, they feel the urge to start a brand-new campaign because they&#x27;ve already figured out that portion of the gameplay.&quot;
Sitting across the table, these words ring frighteningly true for me. Unbeknownst to Nikolov, he has just described the exact experience I had playing the 50-turn campaign preview for Pharaoh a week earlier to an absolute tee. Unlike the far more knowledgeable brain of frequent RPS contributor Nic Reuben, I am a complete babe in arms when it comes to the Total War juggernaut machine, and it took me attempting to play two other games in the series (Three Kingdoms and Troy) and several restarts in Pharaoh itself before I felt just about confident that I (very vaguely) knew what I was doing. At the time, I thought, &#x27;Man alive, how is Total War still so rubbish at teaching players how it works?&#x27; But when I speak to Nikolov a week later, he has some very welcome news for me: there&#x27;s going to be a dedicated tutorial campaign where players can (hopefully) find their feet. Music to my ears.

                              <span>The opening theme of Mythforce is a wonderfully observed 1980s positivity ballad in the style of Jayce and The Wheeled Warriors. This song believes in you, aggressively so. &quot;MythForce! MythForce! Everyday people become heroes! / MythForce! MythForce! You and me, we can defeat evil!&quot; The roguelike dungeon dallying that follows doesn&#x27;t take that &quot;you can do it!&quot; Saturday morning cartoon flavour to its comedic conclusion in the same way an Adult Swim animation might, or a Devolver game would. Instead the real focus seems to be function over flavour, resulting in a skeleton-battering jaunt that is competent and comfortable, yet never fully embracing the silliness promised by the sick guitar riffs of the theme.

                              <span>Being a dedicated spacer I&#x27;ve never had much interest in the base construction aspect of Starfield, but that was before I learned that you can spacewalk by means of console commands, aka cheats. Reddit user WeirdConcern4666 made history on this front yesterday. Here&#x27;s how you do it: 1) get up from the cockpit controls, 2) hit the tilde key to open the command console at the bottom of the screen, 3) type &quot;player.setpos x 10&quot; to teleport your character outside the ship, then hit return and 4) type &quot;setgravityscale 0&quot; to engage zero gravity and stop your character plummeting endlessly. Then hit the tilde key again to close the command console, and well, there you go.
Space sure is bigger outside a spaceship, isn&#x27;t it? Just as well you brought that jetpack. If your vessel of choice is on the bulky side, like mine, you might need to increase the number on the end of &quot;player.setpos&quot; to escape the invisible barriers around your craft&#x27;s exterior. Witness my character Mary Read&#x27;s first attempts at a spacewalk below. If you&#x27;ve somehow discarded your jetpack, you can always punt yourself about with the recoil from an appropriately chunky firearm.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about you, but after spending 100+ hours in both Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, I&#x27;m well up for an AC game that reins its open world in a bit and goes back to the sort-of single city stab-athon the series used to be. The ones where stealth actually mattered, and you felt like a proper assassin working from the shadows. Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is all this to a tee - as Ubisoft have taken great pains to remind us over the last year as they gear up to celebrate the series&#x27; 15th anniversary. 
And after spending three hours playing some of its early mission sequences, I can confirm this is very much a game whose sole purpose is to scratch that nostalgic itch good and proper (before we inevitably hurl ourselves into the still very ambiguous void of whatever the heck Assassin&#x27;s Creed Infinity is). If, however, you don&#x27;t have much fondness for those older games, and prefer the more action-oriented RPG-ing of recent Creeds, Mirage is probably going to feel like a step backward from all the things you know and like - and you may be better off waiting until the next big open world entry set in feudal Japan pitches up instead.

The Dell G2724D is a well-reviewed 27-inch monitor that sports a better Fast IPS screen, a DisplayHDR 400 certification, FreeSync/G-Sync compatibility and even works with consoles at 1440p 120Hz.

                              <span>The first time I heard of Steam it was, as you might expect, in conjunction with the release of a little FPS called Half-Life 2 back in 2004. You needed Steam to access it, whether you bought the digital version or a retail copy. Given relative unfamiliarity with digital distribution, the nascent status of broadband internet in the UK and US, and the much greater importance of physical game sales at the time, this caused quite a stir. I remember being alarmed by an op-ed over on GameRevolution.com that held forth at length about the risk of conflicts between Steam and other software, if players were outright required to leave it running. How quaint those anxieties seem today - the day of Steam&#x27;s 20th anniversary. And yet, there&#x27;s nothing quaint about Steam&#x27;s ability to shape the field in which it operates.

The Xe driver better supports non-x86 CPU architectures, better designed and more performant around their modern integrated and discrete GPUs, and overall is able to make better design choices and improvements in being a clean sheet driver design compared to all the code that has built up in i915 over the years.

                              <span>Apple held a special keynote event today to reveal the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, new Apple Watches, and more. While new iPhones aren’t exactly surprising given the company&#x27;s annual cadence, what is surprising is that Apple has also announced that Resident Evil 4 (Remake), Resident Evil Village, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage, and Death Stranding are coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as reported by IGN. 

While details were sparse, Apple showed a few screens of the games on a virtual version of the iPhone 15 Pro during today&#x27;s event, stopping short of showing gameplay of these games running on the newly announced phones. It&#x27;s unclear what the gameplay experiences for these games will be like on the iPhone 15 Pro and Max; considering it&#x27;s already possible to connect a Bluetooth controller, like the PlayStation DualSense or Xbox Series X/S gamepad, to various Apple devices, it&#x27;s not a stretch to assume that’s the best way to play these games on this new device. 
As for how these games run on the devices, that remains to be seen. Apple says both Resident Evil games and Death Stranding will be available on the phones later this year, while Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage hits the devices in the first half of 2024, according to IGN.
Resident Evil 4 Remake launched earlier this year, while Capcom released Resident Evil Village in 2021. Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is Game Informer&#x27;s current cover story game, with an exclusive coverage hub as well, and the latest entry in this long-running franchise hits PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on October 5.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced a new Xbox Series X/S controller with a deep purple color scheme on the front and a bright white back. Aptly, this new controller is titled &quot;Astral Purple.&quot; It looks great and is available for preorder now before its September 19 release date. 
Xbox says, &quot;This rich purple color has a distinct regal look to spice up your gaming setup and bolster your collection,&quot; noting that the dark purple theme carries over to both thumbsticks, all four face buttons, and the three menu buttons in the center of the controller. The triggers, bumpers, and d-pad feature a matte black finish, and the back case is a bright white. 
Like most other Xbox Series X/S controllers, the Astral Purple edition will cost $64.99. It&#x27;s available for preorder and releases on September 19. As expected, it features all the usual bells, whistles, and features of the standard Xbox Series X/S controller, so if you’re looking to add a little more purple to your collection, this might be for you. 
While waiting for its release, check out the Stormcloud Vapor controller revealed last month and then read about the Xbox Elite Series 2 &quot;Core&quot; Edition controller. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s list of the top 10 best Xbox Series X/S games.</span>

                              <span>NetherRealm Studios&#x27; latest 2D fighter, Mortal Kombat 1, is right around the corner. Premium and Kollector Editions of the game go live this Thursday, September 14, and the regular edition goes live next week on September 19. Ahead of the game&#x27;s release, NetherRealm has released the official launch trailer, featuring four minutes of new gameplay, fatalities, gore, and more. 
Today&#x27;s trailer also features our first look at gameplay for Shang Tsung, whom you get if you preorder the game, more of the story, which centers on a rebooted Mortal Kombat universe by way of Fire God Liu Kang, and Reiko, General Shao&#x27;s second-in-command. Check it out for yourself below:


Shang Tsung is still a sorcerer and his moveset in the trailer reflects that, with fiery projectiles, massive combos, and the ability to morph into other fighters. Reiko, on the other hand, is described by NetherRealm as &quot;a savage warrior with a fighting style that matches his fierce persona.&quot; Elsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at many of the roster&#x27;s other fighters, like the Jean-Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny Cage and the recently revealed Nitara, who Megan Fox voices. 
Mortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on September 14 for Premium and Kollector editions of the game. The rest of the editions go live on September 19. 
While waiting for the game&#x27;s release, watch Ed Boon talk about Mortal Kombat 1 on hot wing-eating interview show Hot Ones, and then watch this Nitara gameplay trailer. After that, read our hands-on impressions of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s Invasions and Story Mode.

Bilkins&#x27; Folly popped up on my radar, err, sea charts, earlier this year when developer Webbysoft and Publisher Armor Games Studios announced the PC-only title was actually going to launch on PlayStation and Switch now as well. I watched the console announcement trailer and knew I needed to check this game out – old-school adventure gameplay, a fun and whimsical pixel art style, and pirates, of course. It’s been months since that announcement, but I’ve finally played a few hours of Bilkins&#x27; Folly, and that small taste indicates a jolly adventure is on t…</span>

                              <span>In this episode of New Gameplay Today, Blake Hester and I show you a glimpse of a different kind of cooking game, Nour: Play With Your Food. Rather than tasking players with cooking a proper dish, developer Terrifying Jellyfish presents a playspace of ingredients, tools like blowtorches and meat tenderizers, and a suite of odd abilities that change gravity, freeze food, and make your culinary ingredients dance — all in the name of playfulness. While levels contain hidden experiences you can unlock by specific interactions, there&#x27;s hardly a central goal in Nour. Similar to Townscaper, this joyful release is more akin to a toy than a game, and it&#x27;s so much fun.

Alongside Todoroki, Eijiro Kirishima and Mina Ashido are in the Item Shop available for purchase.

With Todoroki on the island, developer Epic Games has added his Ice Wall as an item to the game. With the Ice Wall, you gain the power to summon glacial shields that stand taller than players anywhere. It has a large pool of health and remains in play until its health is depleted. Plus, when you use it, everyone around it is knocked back. They also gain icy feet, which will cause them to slip and slide all over the place.

                              <span>Lenovo&#x27;s Legion laptop line looks lovely, and today the Legion 5 Slim gaming laptop with an RTX 4060 graphics card and Ryzen 7 7840HS processor has been discounted from £1500 to £1150 with code MEGADEAL111. That&#x27;s one of the best prices we&#x27;ve seen for this spec - if not the outright best; that&#x27;s reserved for Black Friday - and well worth considering if you&#x27;re in the market for a high-end gaming laptop.

                              <span>Hitting pause in a video game is like dropping a wall across it. On one side of the wall lies what is called the diegetic space of the game, aka the fictitious world, which is generally the aspect that receives the most interest, the aspect that tends to attract the weasel word &quot;immersive&quot;. On the other side of the wall lie menus, settings and other features that form a non-diegetic layer of bald operator functions - technical conveniences and lists of things to tweak or customise, from graphics modes to character inventory, that are cut adrift in a vacuum outside of time. 


In theory, the pause screen and its contents are not truly part of the game. There is no temporality, no sense of place, no threat, no possibility of play, no character or narrative, no save the princess, no press X to Jason or pay respects, no gather your party before travelling forth. As the scholar Madison Schmalzer points out in the paper I&#x27;m wonkily paraphrasing here, &quot;the language of the menu itself emphasizes the menu&#x27;s position as outside of gameplay by labeling the option to continue as &#x27;resume game.&#x27; The game world is always privileged as the site that gameplay happens.&quot;

                              <span>There was a time back in my school days when cardgames were all the rage. Everybody had a deck of playing cards in their pocket for cheeky 15 minute rounds of Texas Hold &#x27;Em between lessons, with Milky Way segments and Niknaks wagered in place of chips. Yes, I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m starting to sound like Grandpa Simpson, and no, this wasn&#x27;t from some murky era before the invention of videogames. It was the heyday of the Gameboy Advance! I&#x27;m not sure what we were thinking. But two things: 1) decks of playing cards are cheaper than game consoles, and 2) part of the fun, possibly, was that nobody really knew how to play the ostensibly well-known cardgames we were playing.
With the benefit of hindsight, I suspect there may have been creative liberties taken with the rules at times. I knew hair-pulling wasn&#x27;t a legal move in professional poker. Anyway, I&#x27;m reminded of all this by Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, a warped and mildly satirical, 90s-styled take on Blackjack from Purple Moss Collectors.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Radeon RX 6800 and 6800 XT graphics cards have proven surprisingly popular even into 2023, as new price drops (and relatively modest gen-on-gen performance increases for newer models) has left them as competitive options in terms of value for money. 
Today we&#x27;ve got a deal on the RX 6800 non-XT, with an MSI model going for just under $400 at Newegg. That&#x27;s a $70 reduction from its usual price and $20 cheaper than the cheapest RX 6800 model on Amazon. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for a strong 1440p graphics card that comes with a copy of Starfield Premium Edition (which includes the Shattered Space story expansion, a digital art book, the game&#x27;s OST and a few weapon/suit skins on top of the base game).

                              <span>1440p 144Hz monitors have been the most popular category for PC gamers for a little while now, offering a good blend of detail and responsiveness, and over time we&#x27;ve seen what was once a £500+ spec drift down to below £300. It&#x27;s still rare to see a good example closer to £200 though, and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ve got today: a 27-inch model from system integrators AWD-IT, the X&#x3D; XRGB27WQ, available for £210 after a £70 discount.

A whopping 86% don&#x27;t result in any removals.  This high rejection rate is mostly the result of &quot;careless&quot; incomplete notices sent by takedown companies, the report notes.

Abriss has you destroying brutalist architecture in a futuristic cityscape using rockets, wrecking arms and laser pinwheels of your own design. Whatever you construct, the result is a glorious physics spectacle. After a little over a year in Steam Early Access, it hit 1.0 earlier this week.

                              <span>I never watched the original Gargoyles animated series, but I&#x27;ve been on the internet for long enough to know that it&#x27;s a cult favourite for being a Disney show with surprisingly dark themes. I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.

Both those games were re-released in 2021, and now it&#x27;s Gargoyles&#x27; turn. There&#x27;s a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.

While that comment should be viewed in context, when taken literally that could mean the end of all piracy. Of course, nothing in this game is so straightforward.

                              <span>Epic Games chief creative officer Donald Mustard is retiring this month after seven years with the company. He announced this today on Twitter, stating that after working in the games industry for nearly 25 years, he is retiring to spend time with his wife and family. 
Most notably, Mustard served as the head of Fortnite, responsible for leading its storytelling and creative decision-making behind the game as a battle royale. Epic Games has not announced who will be taking over the role after Mustard retires, nor has it specified what the future of Fortnite looks like, although hundreds are working on it, and things will likely continue as usual. 
Here’s what Mustard posted on Twitter:
After an incredible adventure, I will be retiring from my role as Chief Creative Officer at Epic this month.

                              <span>Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.
Per Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company&#x27;s new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. 
&quot;This is a game that&#x27;s all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,&quot; Baird tells EW. &quot;It&#x27;s a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there&#x27;s such a hilarious dynamic. So, there&#x27;s comedy inherent in this, but there&#x27;s not one human being in this movie. I think it&#x27;s one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that&#x27;s the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.&quot;
Stray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat&#x27;s journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here.

                              <span>Xbox has announced a digital broadcast set to air during Tokyo Game Show this month. The presentation takes place on September 21 at 2 a.m. PT/5 a.m. ET.
According to Xbox Wire, the event will feature “progress updates from Xbox and Bethesda Softworks and see a creatively diverse collection of games from creators predominantly located in Japan and across Asia.” The event will also reveal new titles for Xbox Game Pass.
The most likely game to appear is Final Fantasy XIV, which is heading to Xbox next spring ahead of its upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which last popped up during this summer&#x27;s Xbox Games Showcase, could also reappear. Of course, there are plenty of big Japanse developed titles incoming that could get a spotlight, and it&#x27;s always interesting to see what Asian companies and titles it courts each year. 
Tokyo Game Show runs from September 21 to 24. Publishers like Capcom, Atlus, Sega, Koei Tecmo, and Square Enix, among others, will air dedicated livestreams throughout the event.</span>

For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;With such a busy holiday season of releases, how are you prioritizing your gaming time?&quot;

                              <span>Acer&#x27;s Predator laptops are nice options that often deliver a lot of performance for reasonable money, but today you can get even more per dollar than usual, as an RTX 3070 Ti gaming laptop in manufacturer-refurbished condition has dropped to $919 at Ebay - thanks to an extra 8% discount on refurbished items applied in the cart. 
For context, this laptop has a list price of $2099 and still seems to be selling new for $1679 on Amazon - so this price is very reasonable indeed.

If you&#x27;re considering a Ryzen 7000 system, then you&#x27;ll want a good value motherboard - and this option from MSI is a really good shout at $50 off.

That price is courtesy of a $10 discount when you use code SSACW527 and runs for today only. 
The P5 Plus is a drive that we&#x27;ve covered many times over on the RPS Deals beat, as it comes very close in performance to the top options in its category - your Samsung 990 Pros and your WD SN850xs - while often costing much less.

That makes it a great time to add a huge amount of storage to your Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Nintendo Switch - or indeed, your camera, drone, phone or tablet.

                              <span>There’s a growing subgenre of horror games that lure you in with cutesy charm before revealing something sinister waiting beneath it. Your Doki Doki Literature Clubs. Your Among The Sleeps. Your Opening A Box Of Celebrations Only To Find Your Mum’s Knitting Kit. Absolutely bone-chilling stuff. The Bunny Graveyard fits right in with this idea, which tells a seemingly sweet tale across a series of mini-games à la WarioWare, but as expected, things take a creepy turn in the trailer below.

                              <span>I first clocked the mysterious-looking OU when Japanese indie collective Asobu did their pre-Bitsummit showcase stream in 2021. It wasn&#x27;t entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who&#x27;d found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  
But its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I&#x27;ve only played about two hours of it so far, but it&#x27;s clear there&#x27;s still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It&#x27;s one of those games that&#x27;s designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I&#x27;ve just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I&#x27;m not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can&#x27;t get it out of my head.

                              <span>Announced earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, Islands Of Insight is, somehow, both an open world multiplayer game, and a puzzle game - something akin to The Witness but in a fantasy world you share with other players. There are serene floating islands, wide open flying and a varied chocolate box of puzzles. Publisher Behaviour Interactive (from Dead By Daylight fame) have now announced a free open playtest, available to everyone from now until September 21st. As lovely as the game looks, I’m excited to try Islands Of Insight for myself.

                              <span>Although most of my favourite films are tragedies, games with a grim and heavy premise don&#x27;t often appeal to me as much as you&#x27;d think. I wasn&#x27;t quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it&#x27;s about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.
It&#x27;s actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it&#x27;s not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I&#x27;d call it &quot;diverting&quot; rather than &quot;entertaining&quot;, but the bottom line is there&#x27;s a good afternoon or two in there for you.

                              <span>Cursed ship designs were always an inevitability with Starfield, and after two full days in the wild, players have already made some wildly funky and plainly cool ships. Scrolling through social media channels, you’ll find that players have hammered away at their own unique designs while also creatively remaking other iconic vessels from Mass Effect, Star Wars, Halo and, of course, our friend Thomas The Tank Engine. There’s also been a shocking lack of, uhm, male organ-shaped spacecraft which makes putting this post together much less hard. But for now, onward! Let’s admire some cool ships.

                              <span>Confession time: if you&#x27;ve been keeping up to date with Colossal Order&#x27;s feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you&#x27;re probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.
But the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We&#x27;ve known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order&#x27;s Maps &amp; Themes video, I thought, &#x27;Yes, those sure look enormous!&#x27; But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and…

                              <span>Paradox have announced that Star Trek: Infinite is coming out on October 12th. Infinite’s previous trailers already made it look like a &quot;Stellaris in a different version of space&quot; affair - which is by no means an unfavourable comparison - and the latest footage shows off more grand strategy shenanigans. Planet management. Lotsa menus. Expanding factions, sometimes peacefully if you prefer a clear conscience.

                              <span>On today’s installment of Bad Calls I Have Made, I will cop to never really buying the idea of Starfield needing an SSD. Even among its astronomical system requirements, an inflexible demand for solid state storage seemed like a stretch; after all, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart runs mostly fine on a hard drive, and in a previous life that game was employed as a cheerleader for the PS5’s SSD. Starfield would probably just have rubbish load times or texture pop-in or something, and all would be revealed once I could try it on mechanical storage. Which I now have.
So, can you play Starfield on an HDD? No. It’s bloody awful.

                              <span>The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 
If you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.
We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.

                              <span>Some would say the best way to wind down after a rough day down the Content Reactors isn’t to play a grotty occult horror game, but I caught a trailer for Tenebris Somnia earlier, and couldn’t help myself. In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. 


The game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you&#x27;ll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself! (It&#x27;s just occurred to me, 24 hours too late, that the above joke only makes sense if you&#x27;re viewing our Latest feed. Everybody else, erm - scroll down?)

The Runemaster has five new spells they can use to tear through the game&#x27;s monsters, and each spell can be customised via its own skill tree.

The update, called &quot;Runes Of Power&quot;, also adds eight new languages, and a new type of event called Rune Prisons. Developers Eleventh Hour also announced that Last Epoch&#x27;s 1.0 release would happen in December this year.

The ESA have informed the Los Angeles Convention Center, the event&#x27;s traditional home, that it will not be hosting a show there next year, and events company ReedPop are no longer working with the ESA on future E3 events.

                              <span>Maybe it was replaying Aperture Desk Job for the RPS Game Club, or maybe it was the sheer scale of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 activating the ol’ fight-or-flight. Either way, I’ve recently developed an intense appreciation for teeny, tiny microgames, to the point where I’ve essentially been begging in the RPS Slack channel for recommendations. Just one more Steam link and I’ll be fine, promise.
And I don’t mean short games in the seven- or eight-hour sense. Not even film-length games like Portal or Jazzpunk. No, I seek to gorge on the slightest sub-hour canapés, games in which you can see and do everything in one or hour or less. &quot;Irresponsibly large&quot;? Another time, Mister Starfield, I crave something irrevocably small.

                              <span>Space will neither save nor free us. Like Starfield, it will not be glamorous or exciting. As billionaire jebends plot to establish their own corporate fiefdoms amongst the stars, our descendents&#x27; potential spacelives are looking as miserable as collecting 5 spacewolf livers. But I find some hope in spaceship salvage sim Hardspace: Shipbreaker, both in the overt plot about unionisation and in the small satisfaction of doing a job well. Head down, shut up, and focus on dismantling this spaceship carefully and efficiently. It&#x27;s an attitude that won&#x27;t save the world but can get you through one more day, and sometimes that&#x27;s enough.

                              <span>When I finished Part 1 of my perverse effort to play Starfield entirely as a space sim, I was both terrified and tantalised. A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can&#x27;t just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It&#x27;s possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you&#x27;ve found one, don&#x27;t spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. 


My first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn&#x27;t so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.

                              <span>Greetings, starchildren. This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we talk about Starfield, the game on everyone&#x27;s lips! We got code late due to an unknown random happenstance, but we&#x27;ve now put a bunch of time into playing it so can have a blimmin&#x27; great chat about Bethesda&#x27;s space RPG. I sound like I hate it, but don&#x27;t. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.
As you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We&#x27;ve Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.

                              <span>Hello folks. How was Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 August for you? Ready for Starfield September? I hope you are, because lemme tell you, it&#x27;s coming all right. In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like &quot;spam&quot;, harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we&#x27;re somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month&#x27;s Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.

                              <span>Sometimes, a game sits at such a cross section of my interests that it almost feels made specifically for me. In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of &quot;reverse tower defence&quot;, as the game&#x27;s Steam page is keen to point out. It&#x27;s your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that&#x27;s by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.

                              <span>Oft&#x27; am I struck by the fact that video game homes belonging to characters in the depths of despair are nicer that all of the homes I&#x27;ve lived in myself. Granted, I&#x27;m a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of &quot;I think I could just about afford that one day&quot; status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.
Under The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I&#x27;ve had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it&#x27;s not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn&#x27;t a metaphor for grief? It&#x27;s never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to &quot;what [he&#x27;s] been through&quot; half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan&#x27;s capsule living area and you think &quot;this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?&quot;

                              <span>I like to think that I&#x27;m above the lure of Cool Violent Thing in Videogame these days, but when I see a lanky robot parry a nuclear shockwave with a katana as though swatting a wasp, I find myself Enthused.
The videogame in question is Pyrolith&#x27;s V.A. Proxy, which I&#x27;ve had my eye on for a while, on account of it being inspired by Nier: Automata and Devil May Cry, with a landscape of megastructures and bruised and rusty art direction that calls to mind The Signal from Tölva. In this moody open world action game, you play one of three robots who awaken to find their memories gone, and promptly set out in search of their creator. It&#x27;d be an eye-catcher even without the atomic parry, which you can witness for yourself in the embedded clip below.

Two of the sites may be survivors of a U.S. law enforcement domain seizure campaign carried out last year.

                              <span>Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  Syberia 1 and Syberia 2 bundled with ScummVM.
This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.

                              <span>Tackling online piracy isn&#x27;t an easy task. In addition to dismantling illicit sites and services, the public at large should be made aware of the associated risks and threats. According to the Premier League, news media can be helpful to spread these messages. However, the lines between reporting news and serving as a simple mouthpiece can sometimes find themselves blurred.
