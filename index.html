                              <span>Rock, Rock, Rockin&#x27; Rollergames...
It&#x27;s time to get your skates on, quite literally, (well, digitally), as the retro fun fans over at Hamster have added Nichibutsu&#x27;s whirling derby dervish Roller Jammer to PS4 and Nintendo Switch — the latest addition to its record-breaking Arcade Archives range.
Release to arcades way back in 1984, Roller Jammer is a very loose take on the world&#x27;s most complicated sport: Roller Derby. Instead of being packed out with screaming, tattoed gals sporting cool names like &quot;Anna Geddon&quot;, this digital take on hard-hitting wheeled warfare features a bunch of boring 8-bit dudes. We were still a good six years away from the debut of the outrageous, WWE-like show Rollergames, and thus Roller Jammer boasts a less glamorous, simplistic take on the sport.

Perhaps understanding that it does not have tech available to recreate the ins and outs of roller derby proper, Nichibutsu chooses to play a little fast and loose with its adaptation of the sport, tasking playing with gunning through thin slaloms of flags before eventually engaging in an every-man-for-themselves race, complete with a hilarious &quot;double lariat&quot; maneuver. While Roller Jammer&#x27;s relative obscurity makes this Arcade Archives release a little notable, ultimately it&#x27;s pretty difficult to recommend this title.
Roller Jammer is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

                              <span>Licensed games need to make a comeback
We&#x27;ve seen countless game-to-TV or film adaptations announced over the past few months, and while it&#x27;s exciting to see some really great properties getting even more love, part of me wishes we could see more pre-existing properties be turned into licensed games. Take one of the most beloved game franchises of all time: The Witcher. Those were books before they were games, and CD Projekt Red&#x27;s take on the adventures of Geralt brought a fresh take to the series, just like the Netflix series that came after it.
What got me thinking about all of this in the first place is that I finally got around to watching Season 4 of Stranger Things, and I was reminded of the Telltale series adaptation of the show that never saw the light of day.

Putting the cat in catastrophe
The second I saw the announcement trailer for Stray, I knew it was a game I was going to play on release day, no questions asked. I am a cat mom, after all, so anything with a cat, let alone as a playable character, is a big win in my book. While it was pretty easy to get me on board with the premise of Stray alone, one thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was just how rich and compelling the story was going to be in this game. I mean, it was published by Annapurna so that should have been my first clue, but even so, it slipped my mind.
To start, the worldbuilding was incredibly detailed and made talking to NPCs, a pretty important mechanic when you&#x27;…</span>

The second wave of the new Booster Course tracks for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will be here next week, and we&#x27;re feeling hyped to try out some new races (and a little disappointed that some of them look more like Mario Kart Tour tracks than Mario Kart 8 tracks).
In the spirit of hype, we&#x27;re trying to gauge how people are feeling about this new wave, and the DLC in general. Is it everything you&#x27;d hoped for? A cool bonus to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription? A bit disappointing? Or are you just totally bummed that Nintendo is pumping time and money into an old Mario Kart game instead of something else — like a new Mario Kart game?

Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of Box Art Brawl!
In last week&#x27;s edition, Metroid Prime - one of the greatest console games of all time - entered the ring. As we&#x27;d predicted, it was a pretty close battle, but Japan&#x27;s more action-packed (if you can call it that) design just managed to beat out North America and Europe&#x27;s more restrained approach with 53% of the vote. It just goes to show that even the most iconic box art design is not necessarily the best one.

It&#x27;s the launch weekend for Xenoblade Chronicles 3, and although there was a lot of demand for the physical versions of the game, it seems plenty of people are still picking up the digital version of the title.
For some, these purchases may have even been due to the delays associated with the fancier collector&#x27;s versions. According to the eShop charts in the US, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is now out in front of Minecraft.

Nintendo preservation website Forest of Illusion has managed to acquire another rare piece of gaming history. It&#x27;s been able to archive a Japan prototype of the Nintendo DS X4 firmware - recovered from an X4 prototype unit.
According to the source, &quot;just about every aspect of this version is different from the final retail release&quot;. One of the highlights is the boot up screen. Instead of featuring the Nintendo DS logo, it appears to be a GBA placeholder screen and a sound file of children shouting &quot;Nintendo&quot; (you can have a listen below).

                              <span>Several people on RPS have managed to secure a Steam Deck since Valve&#x27;s handheld starting shipping around five months ago. If you&#x27;re not so lucky, then good news: Valve say they&#x27;re speeding up production and everyone who has currently ordered one should receive their Steam Deck before the end of the year.

                              <span>Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest update introduced a new player reporting tool, which allows players to submit &quot;inappropriate chat messages or dangerous behaviour&quot; for moderators to review. That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren&#x27;t happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don&#x27;t like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

I&#x27;ve had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that&#x27;s down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

It&#x27;s nice to see a cool off-the-radar indie game resurface with a release window after years of wondering. This is my first time seeing The Siege and the Sandfox, but as a stealth-based metroidvania with detailed pixel art, it quickly left a good impression.
The developers at Cardboard Sword have teamed up with publisher Koch Media to launch their debut game. Along with a new trailer this week (which helps reintroduce the &quot;stealthvania&quot; concept), they&#x27;ve set their sights on a 2023 release on PC.

If you&#x27;re curious about the game&#x27;s name, here&#x27;s the deal: a desert kingdom is under siege, and you&#x27;ll sneak around as a legendary figure, the Sandfox, to save the kingdom.

It&#x27;s so easy to love the shrunken-kids-versus-oversized-insects premise of Grounded, especially with Obsidian Entertainment&#x27;s sense of humor, but no matter how good this base-building survival game looks, many players are going to hold off until early access wraps up. The studio previously quoted September, and has since narrowed it down to a September 27 release for Grounded 1.0 on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.
In case you missed the 1.0 trailer during the summer gaming showcases, here it is again.

According to game director Adam Brennecke, the team is in the &quot;home stretch.&quot;

Ghostwire: Tokyo has begun regularly popping up in PlayStation Store and Steam sales, and given the less-than-stellar reception it got at launch, plenty of people are only now cracking into this supernatural action-adventure game. I&#x27;m one of them! I recently finished the story, but try as I might, I cannot shake this game off. I refuse to delete Ghostwire: Tokyo from my PS5 until I finish out my 100% completionist goal, and there&#x27;s one annoying issue standing in my way: slow-spawning parades, known in-game as Hyakki Yako.
Consider this a friendly heads-up that may or may not come in handy one day.
Without getting too deep into the actual story, a big part of the game is saving stranded souls in Tokyo after a supernatural event — 240,300 souls, to be exa…</span>

Welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? friends. It&#x27;s yer boy Moyse, back in black and hoping to help you get your weekend off to a fine start. This has been a pretty hectic week for me, with some frustrating health drama and general ongoing malaise, but the beat goes on and so do I. As is always the case, July has been a slow month for the good ship Destructoid, with the annual news drought in full swing. Though Gamescom is just around the corner, to be followed up by the fall schedule, this year is definitely something of an anomaly, given that the biggest and most anticipated games are already on the market.
Still, at least we&#x27;ve all been given a lot of good stuff to play in The Year of Our Lord 2022, and with more than enough time to get through it all way ahead of…</span>

Hey guys! Got some hot days ahead, huh? I’m sweltering without AC through this heatwave and my tech has felt it too; tonight I may have to run without a camera as it overheats and freezes nearly immediately. I know, it feels weird. I thought tonight we could fullscreen the rest of Stray, the atmospheric kitty game taking the internet by storm, and then focus on doing some more wildly difficult puzzles in Baba Is You or The Witness. See you tonight!

I’ll need your brainpower. Be sure to drink plenty of water and stay cool.
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

I once described the SNES version of Rampart as not “the most faithful” but “the version that best fits on consoles.” I maybe stand by that, but I have a contender for the least faithful. While the NES got a decent version of Rampart, the Famicom, for whatever reason, got a completely different one. This isn’t the only time this has happened. The case of the NES/Famicom disparity of Maniac Mansion is another one. An equally confusing one.
Rampart on Famicom was developed by Konami by most of the team that would go on to create games like Lagrange Point and Batman Returns. A talented team to be sure. It’s clear that the development team played Rampart, but they didn’t seem that interested in replicating the gameplay.

Final Fantasy XIV has no shortage of content. Raids, dungeons, trials, mount farming, or just good ol&#x27; fishing, there&#x27;s always something to do. But between every activity, I find the one thing I keep on doing in Final Fantasy XIV is messing around with the interface.
Since starting the game back in December, I&#x27;ve managed to go from A Realm Reborn all the way to Endwalker, the most recent expansion. (Yes, that pace was pretty fast, though sadly not on par with Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.)
In the time since, I&#x27;ve learned a lot of lessons: eat food to buff your stats, use retainers to sell unwanted items, and know which ledges are not safe to Dragoon-backflip next to. But in all of it, I keep on messing with my hotbars.

                              <span>A small project about blinking through life became a seven-year journey
It was during IndieCade 2014 that the team behind indie hit Before Your Eyes knew they had something. They were showing a student project, titled Close Your at the time. And even in its earliest state, it was emotionally resonating with people who played it.
&quot;People were crying, you know, after sitting down with it for 15 minutes,&quot; remembers Graham Parkes, creative director and lead writer at GoodbyeWorld Games. 
The group had brought a student project to show off, next to up-and-coming experiences like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. They didn&#x27;t know at the time that it would kick off a seven-year journey, eventually leading to a published release under Skybound and a BAFTA.

This article is part of our new experimental series, Backlog Club, where we (Nintendo Life!) pick a game that&#x27;s likely to be on our list of &quot;games we should get around to playing&quot;, and then we (NL + you!) spend the next month playing that game.

And we also took a look back at all of the unique gimmicks throughout the Pokémon series&#x27; history.

Well, after a long wait it&#x27;s finally here - no, we&#x27;re not talking about Xenoblade Chronicles 3, the focus here is instead on Bandai Namco&#x27;s new Digimon Survive game.
After a lengthy development cycle and multiple delays, the game has now been released across multiple systems including the Nintendo Switch. At this point in time, there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be any reviews for the game online - with a lot of outlets only receiving codes now.

Legal action is already underway, but the process isn&#x27;t going exactly to plan.

The film rights to Tomb Raider are up for grabs yet again after MGM failed to make a sequel after the 2018 film, which would have allowed them to keep the rights — although there were plans to make another film in the series at one point.
The most likely factor in plans for the sequel fizzling out is Amazon&#x27;s acquisition of MGM back in March of this year. There&#x27;s a good chance that with the merger going on, any projects in the works were put on pause, which is unfortunate when there&#x27;s a ticking clock for maintaining your IPs. Fans had a lukewarm reaction regarding the 2018 movie, but it did fairly well at the box office internationally, so it&#x27;s kind of a shame that they&#x27;re not getting a second chance with Vikander&#x27;s version of Croft.

Tomb Raider&#x27;s treasure-hunting counterpart Uncharted (also sometimes called Dude Raider by fans) did quite well in the box office this year, raking in just over $400 million, and securing its spot as the fourth most profitable video game movie to date. It&#x27;s hard to say whether this had to do with its star-studded cast, which included Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, or if fans just liked the movie more, but either way, I think it shows that fans are still down for an Indiana Jones-inspired action adventure.
There&#x27;s a good chance that we&#x27;ll be getting another reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise from whoever picks up the rights, so here&#x27;s hoping that the third time&#x27;s a charm for the franchise. Until then, there&#x27;s always the Tomb Raider anime that Netflix still has in the works.

Pokemon Unite has been out for a full year, and the team is celebrating with some anniversary events. Quite a few events, actually! Whenever I&#x27;ve logged in during this period I&#x27;ve had a heck of a time delving into various menus to accept all of the login bonuses. But by far my favorite element of the event is the Pokemon Unite boss rush mode: a limited-time almost &quot;MMO raid-like&quot; set of encounters against three bosses in a co-op format. I hope it sticks around permanently.
So amid the introduction of Glaceon (July 21), Buzzwole (August 3), and Tyranitar (August 15), there&#x27;s a bunch of different campaigns and bonuses going on.

                              <span>Valve wants Steam graphical assets to be more &#x27;straightforward&#x27; for customers
It&#x27;s a constant struggle for game developers to stand out on Steam, and flashy artwork has been a big way to try and draw players in long enough to click through to a game&#x27;s store page. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed the busy banners. Things have escalated to a point that Valve isn&#x27;t comfortable with, and the company has solidified its guidelines — and announced new rules that&#x27;ll go into effect in September — regarding artwork on Steam.
As explained in a Steamworks Development post, Valve wants to &quot;make it as clear and straightforward as possible for customers to find games to buy and play on Steam.&quot;
&quot;Recently, we&#x27;ve noticed more text, award logos, and even review scores being included by game developers in their graphi…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ll carry over most of your stuff
Yes, there is a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ mode.
Since a lot of people like a heads-up about how the end of the game works, you can read all about it here. Note that there are no spoilers at all, but the guide will talk about continuation options at the end of the game (hence the question at the very bottom). So come back later if you only want to know near the end.
Can you continue exploring your original Xenoblade Chronicles 3 file after your save?
Yes. After you finish the game, you&#x27;ll have the opportunity to make a clear save file. Loading it up will bring you back to the area you were at before you finished the game. Clear save files will be denoted by a gold medallion in the top left corner of the file.
Just in case, you may want to save that clear file in a slot you aren&#x27;t using (it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it might matter to you).
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 New Game+ carries over most of your progression
You can also opt to just play a completely new file and start the game over again. A new option will appear on the main menu right next to &quot;New Game,&quot; for &quot;New Game+.&quot;
Here is exactly what carries over, in the words of the game&#x27;s own tutorial for NG+:
You&#x27;ll retain your character growth.
All the tutorials you&#x27;ve read thus far will not come up again (but you can access them via the in-game menu).
All of your inventory outside of key items stay (but you will keep shards and nopon coins).
Unique monster kills will be reset (graves will revive, but if you clear them again you can see your original kill record).
Here is what doesn&#x27;t carry over (and will need to be unlocked):
Chain [super] attacks
Interlinking [Ouroboros]
Key items

If you ever wanted to give off the lascivious odor of the pack of fucking maniacs that make up the Guilty Gear Strive roster, then fragrance company Fairytail Parfum has you covered, from head to toe, in fact.
The cologne and perfume company has released a new line of eau de parfum products based upon the sexy, sexy stars of the Arc System Works fighter. The range launches with four specific characters: the regal and handsome Ky Kiske, the mysterious world-eater Ramlethal Valentine, super-cute Halloweenie Jack-O Valentine, and hard-edged merc Sol Badguy, who looks like he hasn&#x27;t seen a shower in a year.

While the men&#x27;s fragrances are seeing a relaunch, (now in larger 50ml bottles) the two ladies are seeing their respective debuts in the world of fragrance. These are not even Fairytail Parfum&#x27;s first dalliance with the world of Guilty Gear, as the company has previously released perfumes based on Dizzy and Elphelt Valentine — two beloved characters who are yet to make their roster appearance in Guilty Gear Strive (which may be why they have been replaced by Ram and Jack-O in this range).
These are the new fragrance builds, as reported by the fine folk of Siliconera.
Ramlethal: Red thyme, jasmine, and peony at the top; powder, white freesia, and lily of the valley in the middle; white musk, suede, and spice at the bottom.
Jack-O: Fragrant olive, yuzu, and jasmine at the top; iris, apricot, and magnolia in the middle; musk and cedarwood at the bottom.
You can check out the full range of fragrances over on the official Fairytail Parfum website. Given the company&#x27;s Japanese origins, GG fans will likely have to go the import route if they wish to pick up the new perfumes. Each bottle retails for ¥3,520, or roughly $27 USD, not including shipping.
Guilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.

                              <span>Reservation windows are moving on up
Valve has a new update on Steam Deck production, and it&#x27;s some good news. The company announced today that it&#x27;s fulfilling demand sooner than estimated, and so it&#x27;s bumping up reservation spots for those in the queue.
The supply chain shortfalls that initially affected Steam Deck production have been gradually clearing up, and Valve says it is continuing to ramp up its output. According to Valve, the company is able to produce Decks faster than ever before.
Everyone who is currently in the reservation queue will get their Steam Deck email this year. And many customers who were previously in the Q4 or later window have been bumped up to Q3. That window ranges from July to September. Everyone else will fall in the Q4, or October to December, range.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AlWgZhMtlWo
Right now, any new observations will be put in the Q4 bucket. If those fill up, reservations will continue to spill over into the following quarter. Those who have a Deck locked in can check their reservation window on the site.
Much more on Deck
With more of the Steam Decks rolling off the line, this is good news for those still waiting on their portable PC. The company had previously said it was looking to up its production and distribution, and it looks like those efforts bore out well.
The official Steam Deck dock is a bit of a different story, as the official hardware was indefinitely delayed a few months ago. For those getting their Steam Decks in, third-party seems like it will be the way to go for a while. I wound up grabbing a powered hub online, and it&#x27;s been working pretty well while I wait for the real deal to be available.
Also, for those getting a Steam Deck in, be sure to be careful with any hardware mods.

                              <span>Are you in a party, co-op, or head-to-head mood?
Some of my fondest Nintendo Switch memories were formed with multiplayer (and especially co-op) games, and if you&#x27;re looking for a group activity, the Nintendo Multiplayer Sale is worth a run-through. There are about 50 discounted games on the eShop, as well as some DLC, and the deals will stick around through August 7.
You can see the full list of featured games over here, and I&#x27;ve got recommendations. That said, this is a digital Nintendo sale — the games are often great, but rarely cheap.
10 games to consider
Borderlands: The Handsome Collection ($15.99) runs fine on Nintendo Switch.
Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics ($27.99) is a good bang for your buck if you enjoy board and card games — and the AI puts up a fight in solo play.

Want some Xenoblade Chronicles 3 tips? Well, play the game first, and come here if you get stuck or are starting to feel frustrated!
If that&#x27;s the case, we have you covered.

Head to every canteen you can
This is something you should start making a habit of early on. When you visit a canteen anywhere (mostly in colonies, which are like small outposts/towns so to speak), buy the one meal available. It&#x27;ll &quot;unlock&quot; it for use at regular campsites as your team cook (Manana) can now wield the recipe. Canteens can be identified on the map with a handshake symbol (which is also shared by campsites): but it&#x27;ll say the words &quot;canteen&quot; on the screen.
Here is a more detailed breakdown of canteens and the food system in Xenoblade Chronicles 3.

The great mystery of a secret church in one Nier: Automata player&#x27;s copy of the game is over. And, as it turns out, it&#x27;s not some grand marketing scheme for a new Nier or a long-hidden secret. It is a mod. But the end result is pretty impressive nonetheless.
To backtrack for those who missed it the first time around, a player by the name of &quot;sadfutago&quot; was conspicuously seeking help in advancing through a church they found in Nier: Automata. The thing is, this particular part of the Copied City had never been seen before, and no one was able to replicate it.
As a potential new discovery in a well-loved series like Nier, it obviously caused a stir. Cue several days of fevered speculation, memes, and new users flooding into the Nier modding Discord.

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 classes are highly customizable, as you can mix and match abilities from other classes into one synergized player-crafted build. That said, you need to unlock the ability to use a class with everyone in your party. Here&#x27;s how to make sense of the system.
[No major story spoilers will be discussed in this article.]

After meeting a new party member, you&#x27;ll inherently unlock a new class
So this is actually important to understand. Typically, party members join up as part of the main storyline, or through optional quests. To find every possible party member (and thus, unlock all the classes), you&#x27;ll want to head toward ? icons on the map, which generally denote points of interest like new quests: something meatier than a pickup or i…</span>

A Xenoblade Chronicles 3 canteen is useful for multiple reasons. It serves as a rest stop, which you can use to do all sorts of rest-stoppy things like add bonus XP and talk things over with your party for a chance at extra XP and more questlines. But the real thing that sets canteens apart from camps is the ability to learn new recipes for party member Manana. So make sure you make a point to hit every canteen you can!
Here&#x27;s a very early game (like first-few-hours-early) example!

Canteens are typically found in colonies
Colonies are by and large the &quot;cities/towns&quot; of Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Here you&#x27;ll find opportunities to gather up new quests, as well as some hidden caches (barrels full of useful items and equipment), and...canteens.

It has been a full year since the in-house focus group &quot;A Better Ubisoft&quot; penned an open letter to Ubisoft bosses over the reported toxicity, abuse, and harassment that is taking place within the studio&#x27;s walls. And, according to comments made yesterday, not one of the group&#x27;s original requests has been met.
A Better Ubisoft was formed out of both current and former Ubisoft employees, who decided to take matters into their own hands following the publishing of a Bloomberg report into a culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and other toxic behaviors at the Assassin&#x27;s Creed developer. The fallout from the report lead to several resignations and repurposed positions within the studio, as well as an apology video from CEO Yves Guillemot, notorio…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has dated them for September 9
It&#x27;s not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!
As a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they&#x27;ve been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists &quot;December 31, 2022&quot; as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a &quot;global release date&quot; system, it&#x27;s typically close enough barring regional delays.
Production on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it&#x27;ll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what&#x27;s left, we don&#x27;t know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.
As always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that&#x27;s been updated since 2015.

Speaking in a conversation on the Destiny Reddit, community manager Dylan &quot;dmg04&quot; Gafner confirmed that steady streams of abuse from community members — many of which went beyond &quot;rude replies on Twitter or vague comments&quot; and into the realm of &quot;real threats&quot; directed toward both individual employees and the company as a whole — has led to the studio putting up a new wall, so to speak, in order to prevent the physical and mental welfare of its staff.

                              <span>Generation When?
Sony has released its financial results for the fiscal year ending June 31, 2022 (Q1 2022), and while the PlayStation 5 platform continues to gather slight momentum on a global scale, overall the brand is seeing a general decline in customer expenditure, particularly in the realm of software and subscriptions.
The mighty PS5 has now hit an impressive 21.7 million global shipments since its launch in the fall of 2020, with around 2.4 million consoles shipped in Q1. While this number is certainly nothing to be sniffed at, it reflects an increasingly granular sales growth when compared to that of the company&#x27;s previous PlayStation hardware launches. Still, the numbers are moving in the right direction, if a little more slowly than Sony had perhaps hoped.

                              <span>Switch is coming later this year
I&#x27;m always looking for the next title to scratch my cozy game addiction, and it looks like the management sim Bear and Breakfast is the newest release to make that list. While I first heard about the game during the Summer Game Fest stream this year with the gameplay trailer, it was initially announced back in 2020. Players take on the role of a bear named Hank who builds and runs his own bed and breakfast in the woods, and will encounter all kinds of human and animal friends along the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;USaiP4ACTB4
The developers at Gumycat said that they &quot;grew up on management sims,&quot; and that games like Theme Hospital were a huge inspiration for them. In addition to the &quot;usual management stuff,&quot; they also wanted to create a game that tells a story.
The premise is that humans are coming back for some unknown reason, and they need a place to stay, so Hank and his friends decide to fix up old buildings around town for them. Players will advance through Bear and Breakfast&#x27;s story by completing quests that entail the aforementioned management stuff like gathering materials, crafting, building, decorating, and so on. There&#x27;s even a kind of puzzle element to booking guests, making sure they have food they like, as well as some kind of creepy subplot going on, too.
The game&#x27;s art style reminds me of Saturday morning cartoons in an adorably nostalgic way, and the game&#x27;s comedic writing is already being praised in the Steam reviews. With an ever-growing list of games to play these days, Bear and Breakfast has managed (see what I did there?) to find a place at the very top of it. In the past, I&#x27;ve found some management games to lack the depth to have staying power, but this title promises a rich, worthwhile experience that I can&#x27;t wait to play.
Bear and Breakfast is out now on Steam and a Nintendo Switch version is slated for release in &quot;2022.&quot;

                              <span>PC will get it in November, while Xbox owners will wait a while longer
Co-op first-person horde game Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is taking a little extra time for development. Developer Fatshark announced today that the PC version has been pushed to November 30, while Xbox Series X|S will arrive later.
Previously set to arrive in September, the multiplayer PvE game is now splitting out its console and PC launches. In a statement, Fatshark says the Xbox version will arrive &quot;shortly after&quot; PC, with a specific date to be announced.
Fatshark also says that delaying a game is a difficult decision. But it&#x27;s also one the team hopes shows its commitment to making Darktide come together.
&quot;While we have been humbled by the great feedback on the game so far, we also need more time to improve stability, performance, and to mature key systems,&quot; the studio says. &quot;Each is critical to making sure we have the best possible experience for you, the players.&quot;

Squad-based test fire
If you&#x27;re still eager to get in, there will be a chance before November 30. The team will be hosting a series of technical tests ahead of launch, in order to kick the tires on Warhammer 40K: Darktide.
The playtest sign-up page is live on Fatshark&#x27;s site here, and appears to have sign-ups open for both Xbox and PC. Seems like a decent way to get in early if you can&#x27;t wait to fight the Chaos horde.
Fatshark has built a pretty solid reputation with its work on the Vermintide series, creating some stellar co-op PvE games over the years. Safe to say, Darktide has some lofty heights to reach. So a little extra time for the studio to buckle down and work on fine-tuning things to be just right sounds good for the whole squad.
Warhammer 40K: Darktide hits PC on November 30, with Xbox Series X|S arriving sometime later.

                              <span>All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA&#x27;s official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don&#x27;t think so, you can call into Madden NFL&#x27;s ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA&#x27;s snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA&#x27;s involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...

The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year&#x27;s ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player&#x27;s rating? We&#x27;ll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I&#x27;d call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

                              <span>One of the allures of PC gaming is building your rig to the specs you need. Last year, while I didn&#x27;t pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT&#x27;s streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.
If you don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.
When you go to Build Redux&#x27;s website, you see the option to build your PC, but not in the way you would expect. You pick your top three games from a preset list of f…</span>

                              <span>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23&#x27;s on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We&#x27;ll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix&#x27;s Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA&#x27;s Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>&quot;A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.&quot; This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game&#x27;s fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can&#x27;t dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game&#x27;s other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 03 update, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</span>

However, in a piracy case filed by adult entertainment company Strike 3 the purported &quot;Hollywood style quality&quot; of the porn videos is now a topic of contention.

                              <span>The things we&#x27;ll never trade in.
Everyone plays games differently. Some of us buy nothing but digital games, preferring to be able to play whatever we want, wherever we want; others meticulously collect every single physical release they can get their mitts on, before prices skyrocket for a second-hand copy on eBay.
But one thing most of us have in common, especially those of us who gamed before digital-only games were a thing, is a collection of things that represent our gaming career. Sometimes, that&#x27;s the pristine shrink-wrapped copy of Ocarina of Time that we bought in 199whatever from a garage sale that didn&#x27;t know what they had; sometimes, our gaming pride and joy is one of those clear bouncy balls with a plastic Pikachu inside it, because it has sentimental meaning to us.

We celebrate video game anniversaries all the time here at Nintendo Life. Who doesn&#x27;t like a birthday or anniversary? Now, we all know Super Mario World is going to be 32 years old in November this year (who remembers playing it when it first came out?), but it&#x27;s already reached another milestone in digits.
Blogger Supper Mario Broth has worked out that this incredible SNES platformer, and console launch title, will have existed in its completed form, out in the public, for one billion seconds. 1,000,000,000 seconds. So if you&#x27;re also 32 this year, then you&#x27;ll also be about that old in seconds. Makes us feel very old.

Analogue&#x27;s major beta update to its handheld console, the Analogue Pocket, is finally live for users to download, and introduces much anticipated additions to the experience including Memories, Libraries, and openFPGA, Analogue&#x27;s developer program.
Detailed in an announcement post from Analogue itself, the biggest inclusion to the v1.1 update is undoubtedly openFPGA, which Analogue cites as a major way for developers to preserve video game hardware. Several third-party developers have been provided with early access to openFPGA, but users will be able to sample the feature right now with a playable version of SpaceWar!, one of the earliest video games in existence.

Hosiden Corp, an Osaka-based company responsible for assembling Nintendo Switch consoles, has withdrawn its projected sales forecast for the year and is citing difficulties with the procurement of important components as the reason.
Bloomberg reported this withdrawal, which could potentially spell future troubles down the line for Switch production. Half of the company&#x27;s revenue is drawn from Hosiden&#x27;s partnership with Nintendo, company documents suggest.

It will come as no surprise to find out that here at Nintendo Life we love Pokémon, but like many part-time trainers, we also love a good book. It&#x27;s often difficult to bridge between these two worlds, but these Pokémon bookmarks from Moko&#x27;s Makery on Etsy manage to do just that.
As flagged on Twitter by @PokemonBeWillin, seeing your favourite Pokémon taking a little nibble of your page is everything that an avid reader/Nintendo fan can dream of! With examples ranging from Charizard to Gyarados, we are seriously impressed by the creativity that has gone into these designs.

After playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge non-stop for the last month, you would think that we would have exhausted our excitement by now, but today&#x27;s physical release has us itching to buy the game again.
Shredder&#x27;s Revenge is now available in two physical formats: standard and special edition. The former of these is basically what you expect from a release called &#x27;standard&#x27;, although those buying it will receive a 24-page game guide and pipin&#x27; hot pizza pie key ring alongside the physical copy of the game.

Once upon a time, there were two little spiders in love. They span webs together, wiggled their little spider legs, and generally had a nice time. Until one day, a bird came along... and stole one of the spiders away. Now, it&#x27;s up to the non-eaten spidey to find their lost love, if they haven&#x27;t been turned into bird doo doo already.
Adorable spider-platformer Webbed came out earlier this year, and won over arachnophiles and arachnophobes alike thanks to its adorable eight-legged protagonist (and its arachnophobia mode, which you can see below, that turns the spider into a featureless blob).

Wrestler-turned-actor John Cena is the latest in a long line of famous faces to be given his own Fortnite skin and Epic Games has released an official reveal trailer to mark his reveal.
Played like one of Cena&#x27;s iconic ring entrances, the trailer gives us a first real look at the new skin alongside some new accessories including a championship belt and a Five-Digit Slapper Pickaxe. You can also catch a glimpse of the new &#x27;U Can&#x27;t C Me&#x27; emote which can either be purchased separately or as part of a pack.

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

                              <span>During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

                              <span>Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as &quot;angry playmobil&quot;. I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

                              <span>Earlier this month, RPS turned 15 years old, so it only seemed right that this month&#x27;s Time Capsule entry should be the year of our birth: 2007. Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

                              <span>Proteiny se skládají z aminokyselin v pořadí zakódovaném v DNA. Díky sekvenování DNA známe dědičnou informaci mnoha organismů a tím pádem i proteinů, které produkují. Problém je v ve velmi složitém 3D poskládání proteinu, který má velký vliv na výsledné vlastnosti. Připomeňme například přes dvacet let starý a stále běžící distribuovaný projekt Folding@Home.</span>

It was previously aiming to release in September, but in an update on Twitter the developers say Darktide will now launch on November 30th. 

The upside is that they&#x27;re going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

                              <span>A year ago today, employee group A Better Ubisoft posted an open letter demanding more substantial action from Ubisoft management to tackle alleged abuse within the publisher and its many studios. Today, A Better Ubisoft offered an update in which they say that none of their demands have been met and reiterate what they want.

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

                              <span>Alice is away this week, leaving the lads to their own devices to discuss the best nice blokes in video games. A coincidence? Who can say. What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

                              <span>I really appreciate when games don&#x27;t hold your hand. They don&#x27;t waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can&#x27;t freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.</span>

                              <span>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.
A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</span>

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive revealed an eye-brow-raising new shooter called Bounty Star: The Morose Tale of Graveyard Clem. The title blends mech gameplay and farming with a wild west aesthetic, and it’s coming next year. 


Players control Clementine McKinny, a bounty hunter and former soldier looking to atone for her past by keeping the peace in the Red Expanse, a post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest. She uses her trust mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. 
When you&#x27;re not blasting apart enemies, you&#x27;ll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.
Bounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. 
The game, which premiered during last year&#x27;s Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister&#x27;s wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.


The trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex&#x27;s emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala&#x27;s mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.
Thirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It&#x27;s a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. 
A Steam demo goes live later today if you&#x27;re still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.</span>

                              <span>Kentucky Route Zero has become one of the last decade&#x27;s most celebrated narrative adventure games. As such, fans will be happy to know that developer Cardboard Computer is hard at work on its next title.
A dev diary during today&#x27;s Annapurna Showcase doesn&#x27;t reveal much about the game, including its title. We get shots of the team members animating a dog&#x27;s face, with the designers saying the next game will feature fully-animated characters. It also explains the project has a faster tempo and sports funnier writing than KRZ but will ultimately be a tragedy. 
Whatever this game is, it has no release window or announced platforms. You can read our review of Kentucky Route Zero here.</span>

                              <span>In these trying times, the only thing keeping me going is knowing I will play a new Bayonetta game in just a few short months. But hey, let&#x27;s not forget the classics, either. 
Today on Game Informer Live, we&#x27;re revisiting the original Bayonetta, which most intelligent and attractive people will say is one of the best games of all time. 
But that&#x27;s not all! A couple of weeks ago, we started building a Real Grade Wing Gundam Gunpla kit. You can check out the first and second archives right here. I recommend getting caught up because today is the day we&#x27;re finally finishing our build. Come Hell or high water; we are piecing this robot together. 
We&#x27;re going live on our Twitch page at 3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern Time/1:30 PM Pacific). Hope to see you there!</span>

The details discuss how a revamped and improved studio culture has influenced the game&#x27;s design, including its playable protagonists, writing, and tone. 
GTA 6, which Rockstar confirmed was in active development in February, will reportedly star two playable bank robbers in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired tale, and the female protagonist, a first for the series, will be Latina. The game is set in a modern-day, fictionalized Miami and its surrounding areas, which signals a return to Vice City. Despite being set in a single city, the game is said to already have more interior locations than any GTA game. Still, the studio plans to regularly update GTA 6 over time to add more …</span>

                              <span>The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.
The problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.
Developers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. 
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.
The remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.

Originally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce &quot;Incantamentum&quot; correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. &quot;I said, &#x27;Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you&#x27;re going to be adding voice acting to this because it&#x27;s screaming for it&#x27;,&quot; Gilbert tells me. &quot;And he said, &#x27;Well, we will if we can find a publisher who&#x27;ll do it for us.&#x27;&quot; So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.

                              <span>There are some things in this world that just take you completely by surprise. Drop bears, for example. It was a total shock, though, when co-father of the OG Xbox Seamus Blackley revealed earlier this week that the Jurassic World series originally started life as a sequel to 1998&#x27;s terribly received PC-exclusive Jurassic Park: Trespasser. You can watch the original pitch trailer for Jurassic World that Blackley created below.

                              <span>More information about Rockstar’s next Grand Theft Auto game has slipped out of a new report from Bloomberg. Staff at the company spoke about how the cultural changes that have been taking place since former head Dan Houser’s infamous 100-hour working week comments in 2018 have affected the game’s development, with sources saying GTA 6 will apparently have a playable female protagonist for the first time in the series&#x27; history. It sounds like we might have quite some time to wait to play it though, so watch the trailer for GTA Online’s new Criminal Enterprises update below to sate your appetite for misdemeanours.

                              <span>When licensed life sim Disney Dreamlight Valley was revealed in June, I cringed while simultaneously letting out a little “ooh” of excitement. See, Animal Crossing and animated Disney movies have both long been big deals in the Wheeler household, and the new game seemed to be riffing heavily on the former. A fresh gameplay trailer, watchable below, only cements that further.

Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised. Sources from Aspyr told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that the game had been intended for a 2022 release, but that 2025 was more &quot;realistic&quot;.

                              <span>Urbek City Builder looks like a traditional entry to the genre: you place buildings, cars and little people begin to scurry about, and you gradually expand your urban sprawl. The twist is that there&#x27;s no money fuelling your construction. Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building&#x27;s resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.

It&#x27;s out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.

The same leak also includes the first screenshots of Reborn, and a feature list that suggests Reborn is more than a straight port of 2010&#x27;s Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together.

                              <span>Bank robberies are classic cowboy fare. Whether you&#x27;re up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy&#x27;s going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games&#x27; chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  
&quot;In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I&#x27;m fucked up,&quot; he tells me. &quot;In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.&quot;

                              <span>The RTX 2060 is the most affordable RTX graphics card, making it your best shout for gaining the hardware to do real-time ray tracing and frame-rate-boosting DLSS without overpaying. This model debuted at £330, got more expensive over time as the worst of the GPU supply shortage hit, and was impossible to find below RRP even after its next-generation successor, the RTX 3060 launched two years later. 
Now the RTX 2060 has finally dipped in price, making it an ideal time to pick up what is still a powerful and feature-complete graphics card for 1080p or even 1440p gaming. You can pick up a compact EVGA RTX 2060 SC model for just £212 on Amazon right now, a 52% drop from its peak price and a fair deal for the level of performance on offer.

                              <span>The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D is Team Red&#x27;s fastest gaming processor in many titles, yet it costs far less than the slightly older 5950X and only a bit more than the 5900X. Reason being? You get fewer cores than those processors, and slower clock speeds, but dramatically increased cache - a trade-off that often provides a massive performance improvement for gaming. 
The 5800X3D was extremely hard to find at launch, with AMD&#x27;s limited inventory being claimed as soon as the first reviews rolled in, but now we&#x27;re starting to see better availability - and today, the first proper discounts. You can pick up the 5800X3D for £384 from CCL, thanks to a £15 off discount code: AFF15.

                              <span>Skull and Bones was first revealed in 2017. As a major fan of Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn&#x27;t exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin&#x27;s Creed franchise&#x27;s excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. 
After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark, and Ubisoft remained mostly silent on the title for years. Then, this month, the publisher announced that it would be re-revealing Skull and Bones on July 7. That return brought with it a brand new look at gameplay and new details about ho…</span>

                              <span>WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.
Cena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. 
While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let&#x27;s throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.

                              <span>Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. 
PS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. 
The play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. 
Lastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.
PlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Ch. 2.

                              <span>Nier: Automata is my favorite game of all time, renowned and criticized for its unconventional narrative design and eccentric characters. Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. 
Someone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg

Randomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a &quot;holy&quot; site. I&#x27;ll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there&#x27;s not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. 
Famed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata&#x27;s best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, &quot;So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.&quot; McDonald also said that it&#x27;s impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. 
Is this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!

Monolith Soft has struggled to recreate and magnify the novelties of the first Xenoblade Chronicles adventure since its 2012 release. The third chapter in the science-fantasy JRPG series suffers the same frustrating fate as XC X and XC 2. Despite its first-rate combat and character progression features, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a bloated trek across vast but lifeless environments further diminished by an unaffecting narrative with one of the worst ensemble casts in the franchise.
XC 3 employs a real-time battle system where “Arts,” advanced skills mapped to the controller’s face buttons, give fi…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;d rather play almost any game in first-person rather than third-person. A game in which I&#x27;m a cat might be one of the few exceptions. If you feel differently, and you&#x27;d really like to get inside the head of the feline protagonist in Stray, then there&#x27;s now a first-person mod to help you.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 processors are getting ever cheaper, with the mid-range Ryzen 5 5600 today crossing the £130 barrier for the first time. You can now pick up this super-fast gaming CPU for less than £130, while the more powerful 5600X costs £170 after a similar discount - some way below the last sale price we saw it at. To get the reduced price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HOT10 at the checkout to knock 10% off the price. 
Higher-end Ryzen processors have also seen discounts in recent weeks. We spotted deals on the Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5900X using the same Ebay HOT10 code.

I do enjoy the flow across a week as builds rise and fall on an accelerated timescale before everything is wiped clean and starts over on Monday.

Senior Environment Texture Artist Jonathan Benainous made the comment to a The Last Of Us fan who tweeted at him about the PC version.

                              <span>We all knew it would happen eventually. Plastic statue makers Funko have revealed at San Diego Comic-Con that their Funko Pop collectibles will star in games produced by relative newcomers 10.10 Games. However, 10.10 was started up by Jon Burton, who also founded Traveller’s Tales, the purveyor of Lego games. You can watch the very short announcement teaser trailer below.

                              <span>Less than a week after Stray launched, the smash-hit cyberpunk cat adventure has dozens of mods available with new looks for our little friend. My favourites are when modders make the game&#x27;s cat look like their own real cat, and show me photos of that pretty cat. Then... you have some weirder options, like turning it into Garfield (in both realistic and cartoon forms) or a horrifying quadripedal version of GTA: San Andreas star CJ.

                              <span>Looking at signs in open-world catventure Stray makes me think I’m due for an eye-test. The code language in the game appears a lot like something that should be legible, but it’s not. At least, not straight away anyway. Luckily, these things don’t ever stay cryptic for long. HalfGlassGaming’s Josh Wirtanen has proffered a handy guide to how to read the chapter titles, signs and music sheets, with help from the growing Stray community.

BREIN, meanwhile, reports that it has shut down dozens of illicit IPTV vendors and hundreds of sites that offered these services.

Today at 2:30 PM Central Time (3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific), I&#x27;ll be playing Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix&#x27;s fantastic Neon White on our Twitch channel. I reviewed the game a while back – and gave it my highest score ever, if you&#x27;re wondering – but I&#x27;m starting a fresh save today, so spoilers should be minimal. 
After that, I&#x27;ll be picking up where I left off on our ongoing Gunpla build from last week. We&#x27;re building the Real Grade Wing Gundam, and there&#x27;s still lots to work on. Come watch these little hands cut, sand, and assemble.
Hope to see you there!</span>

                              <span>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum has been delayed. The upcoming adaptation was scheduled to launch on September 1 (with a Switch port coming sometime later). However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum&#x27;s solo adventure. 
Fans have been critical of Gollum&#x27;s perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn&#x27;t reveal a new release date, only saying it&#x27;s delaying the game &quot;by a few months.&quot; 
Here is the complete delay statement: 
 

First of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.

We are dedicated to meeting our community&#x27;s expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.

That being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.

We are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!

Daedalic Entertainment

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum&#x27;s life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character&#x27;s Gollum or Smeagol personalities.

                              <span>Xbox Insider testers noticed a faster boot-up time for their consoles, revealing Microsoft’s recent initiatives to get players into their games quicker. According to The Verge, the cold boot-up time is now estimated to be around 5 seconds. The trick to the faster time lies in a shorter animation. 
Can confirm - worked with @harrisonhoffman and @jakerose27 to create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.
July 23, 2022
The director of Integrated Marketing at Xbox stated (see above) worked alongside the principal product manager for connected TV apps, Harrison Hoffman, and senior product manager lead Jake Rosenberg to “create a shorter boot up animation (~4s) from the original boot up animation (~9s), helping to reduce the overall startup time.” However, there is a catch. You’ll have to set your Series X/S to Energy Saver mode to benefit from the faster boot-up. This means the console will completely power off when you decide to put the controller down and do something else. Nevertheless, this benefits the environment and helps drop the monetary load of electricity bills. 
Ultimately, the boot-up is down from 20 seconds to 15 seconds. That might seem negligible at first glance, but perhaps we’ll reach a period when wait times are nonexistent.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive will hold a livestream showcase of upcoming titles on Thursday, July 28. 
A message shared by the publisher&#x27;s Twitter account yesterday states that the presentation begins at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. Other than that, it offers no hints as to what games will appear. Annapurna&#x27;s last showcase took place just over a year ago, where it highlighted a variety of new titles and game updates, such as Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, The Artful Escape, and more.

Annapurna has been riding a nice wave of momentum lately due to the well-received launches of Stray, the cat-focused post-apocalyptic adventure game developed by BlueTwelve, and Neon White, the anime-inspired platforming action game developed by Ben Esposito and Angel Matrix. The publisher has several noteworthy titles in its portfolio that could get a spotlight on Thursday, some of which haven&#x27;t been heard from in a good while. There&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;ll see more games such as Cocoon, Open Roads, Thirsty Suitors, Storyteller, and Skin Deep. And those are just the games that we know about. 
What do you expect or hope to see at the Annapurna Showcase? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A flying wyvern known as the Lucent Nargacuga will soon nest within a ruined society in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. This creature arrives on August 1 within a free title update for players on Switch and PC.
Capcom released a minute-long trailer that shows a battle against the Lucent Nargacuga within the Forlorn Arena, backed by beautiful moonlight. The wyvern can cloak to evade its attackers and spin within the blink of an eye to knock them back.
In our review for Sunbreak, John Carson said the game needs more threats. &quot;The lack of new monsters plagues the early hours, but there’s plenty to love if you keep at it,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The added flexibility of the Switch Skill Swap system is a freeing and fun expansion to combat for hardcore hunters and the new creatures in the Master Rank quests – when you get to them – breathe life into the experience. For someone already invested in Monster Hunter, there’s plenty to love in Sunbreak.&quot;
This title update brings at least one new beast to hunt. Here&#x27;s hoping players stumble upon more as the world opens up and the new content is unearthed.</span>

                              <span>Funko, the collectibles manufacturer behind the wildly popular Pop line of toys, is partnering with 10:10 games to create a &quot;AAA action platformer&quot; for console and PC. The game is slated to release in 2023 and is spearheaded by video game developer veterans  Jon Burton and Arthur Parsons, who worked together on several Lego games at Traveller&#x27;s Tales and are now at 10:10 Games.
“Creating iconic products that emotionally connect fans to their favorite fandoms is critical to each product portfolio decision,” said Andrew Perlmutter, CEO of Funko. “By partnering with 10:10 Games and utilizing the best creators in the business, we will have the talent to deliver games that reflect Funko’s unique look and feel across its lines and varied products.”
This quote implies Funko&#x27;s stylistic characters with large heads and black eyes could be used for the game. Given the developers&#x27; track record of making games that feature hundreds of playable characters, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think this title may unite many popular brands that have gotten the Funko treatment. For now, all we have is a teaser trailer, which you can view above.</span>

In this article are more tests of the Radoen 680M graphics looking at the integrated graphics speed-up with RDNA2 finally replacing Vega as a big upgrade and also how this compares to the Intel Alder Lake P Xe Graphics performance for Linux laptops.</span>

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s entire cinema industry is on the brink of collapse. A few weeks ago, around 16 cinemas were screening pirate copies of the latest movies; last week it was 127. Not even the chairman of the Association of Cinema Owners can muster much optimism. &quot;I can&#x27;t even blame cinemas now dabbling in torrent screenings,&quot; he says. It&#x27;s not a desire to make money, but a fight for survival.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the highly anticipated sequel to Fallen Order that brings back Cal Kestis likely in a Jedi Knight role. The game doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet and was only shown once in a trailer, but will soon get its first action figure. Hasbro just revealed a six-inch Black Series action figure for the KX Security Droid, which will make its debut in the sequel game.

The Security Droids were a big threat in Fallen Order and look even more imposing now with a weapon that appears to be fuel-based. The tank on the droid&#x27;s back has to be a weak spot. This figure falls into Hasbro&#x27;s long-running Gaming Greats line and will be sold exclusively at GameStop and can be preordered starting July 28 at 1 p.m. ET.
Hasbro also announced a Cal Kestis Vintage Collection figure is on the w…</span>

                              <span>Stray has been out in the wild for a couple of days now, which means players have had plenty of time to answer one burning question: what did you name the cat?
The game’s furry protagonist lacks an official name. As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on? 
Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like &quot;Chester A. Tabby II&quot; (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle,&quot; which has been growing on me. I’m hoping your responses inspire me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I&#x27;m sorry. 
So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I&#x27;m going to stop now. Share your responses below!</span>

                              <span>The MultiVersus roster expands today with the news that LeBron James, Rick Sanchez, and Morty Smith are stepping into the ring. 


King James joins the roster on July 26, the launch of the open beta, as the version of himself that appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. That means he’s rocking his Toon Squad jersey and unleashing all manner of over-the-top basketball moves. You can check him out in action in the gameplay trailer above. 
Mad scientist Rick Sanchez joins the roster when Season 1 begins on August 1. He’ll be rocking his portal gun and can summon Meeseeks, among other zany abilities. Morty joins him during the season, but his arrival date has not yet been confirmed. The young sidekick focuses on using projectiles such as grenade weapons, and he can whip himself at targets. 
The MultiVersus open beta begins July 26 and will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Though if you played the closed alpha, you’re already playing the game right now. 
What do you think of LeBron, Rick, and Morty joining the roster? Who else would you like to see join in? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. 
The game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. 
Watch on Twitch!
Fallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. 
Join Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

                              <span>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition arrives in October and introduces the Winters’ story expansion. This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. 


The update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. 
If you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. 
The towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters. Hilariously, the trailer even shows Dimitrescu tossing her bedroom dresser at a mob, a goofy callback to when she destroyed the same piece of furniture during the main campaign. 
If you already own Resident Evil Village, you can purchase the Winter’s Expansion standalone to access the new Mercenaries content. Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is an all-in-one package that includes the base game and the expansion. Both will launch on October 28.</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. Montreal&#x27;s character spotlights have given us detailed looks at Nightwing and Robin, and now we get a good look at Batgirl&#x27;s combat prowess in Gotham Knights. In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.
Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won&#x27;t disrupt the game&#x27;s cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.
The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.
Following the success of Rocksteady&#x27;s Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal&#x27;s contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here&#x27;s hoping it&#x27;s every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</span>

                              <span>In a lengthy behind-the-scenes video, Naughty Dog&#x27;s development team walks through the changes players can expect from The Last of Us Part I, a high-end PlayStation 5 remake that should look just as good as its sequel. While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.
Along with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.
If you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.
Your time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.
Are you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?</span>

According to the Federation Against Copyright Theft, several unlucky pirates were visited at their homes in the UK this week, where they were presented with cease-and-desist notices. Unpleasant? Maybe. But much better than the alternatives.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that this hasn’t been the coolest week on record in many places around the world, so I’m giving Fortnite the side-eye for the No Sweat Summer event that’s running until August 9th. It’s a bit daft, as you’d expect from Epic Games’ battle royale by this point. You’ll get the opportunity to boogie down, race boats and help rebuild Tilted Towers. Watch the trailer below and marvel at how they can all dance without keeling over.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we turn our attention to shooters and their demands. They all want our undivided attention and for Hayden and I, it&#x27;s fast becoming a bit much. Believe it or not, we&#x27;re adults with clothes to fold and ovens to pre-heat! Daily quests and inane challenges aren&#x27;t bringing us back, if anything, they&#x27;re beginning to drive us away.

                              <span>There’s so many dodgy things I could say about Resident Evil Village’s upcoming DLC’s The Mercenaries Additional Orders mode and its inclusion of a playable Lady Dimitrescu, along with magnetic Nic Cage wannabe Karl Heisenberg and perennial favourite Chris Redfield. Instead, I’ll be a nice lad and keep shtum. Aside from the extra characters, Additional Orders brings more stages and some other improvements to Mercenaries that Capcom haven’t elaborated on. Watch the trailer for it below and imagine being inside Lady D. Oh crap.

                              <span>Cycling in video games leans towards the extreme and the exciting: bombing downhill at murderous speeds, professional racing, treasure hunt, and such. I&#x27;d like to see more of the mundane too. For many adults, a bicycle is simply a way to get to work, to the shops, or to see your pals. So after battle royale shooter PUBG: Battlegrounds added bicycles, I decided to commute around the stag &amp; hen weekend warzones by bike as much as possible.

                              <span>I like a building game that doesn&#x27;t need constant babysitting. I also like one where you get to be a bit creative and build according to your whims as much as to necessity. The Final Earth 2 is an ant farm kind of game that places very few limits on what you can build where, and lets you cheaply restructure as needed even if you mess it up.
The idea is you build vertically, with each building taking up a block, and your people freely travelling through all of them to get to work or home or the pub. Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap. I am absolutely rubbish at it.

                              <span>A new indie horror game released today has challenged players to beat it within Steam&#x27;s two-hour window to claim a refund. Creatively styled Refund Me If You Can, the game puts you in the unenviable shoes of Sarah as she tries to evade monsters in her nightmare and escape a darkened maze. If you did take up the challenge like RPS vid-bud Liam did then you’d have two hours to beat the game, and two weeks from purchase to claim your refund. It didn&#x27;t go well for Liam, as you can see in the video below.

                              <span>It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.


Arriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.

                              <span>Choosing a character portrait is one of the key decisions to spend hours mulling over in any decent CRPG. That’s why it’s awesome to see someone using the power of publicly accessible AI to generate fantasy mugshots for classic examples of the genre such as Baldur’s Gate. Indie app dev and documentary editor Alex Hay has created some great examples, which he’s shared on Twitter with Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition devs Beamdog and their CEO Trent Oster.

                              <span>Alice O&#x27;s excellent Tour de Jeux words - which see her celebrate cycling in games and real life alongside the ongoing Tour De France - got me thinking about the sorts of exercise that take up a good chunk of my spare time. As some of you might know, I&#x27;m that badminton guy. That guy who always mentions he&#x27;s away at a tournament sweating and eating bananas. That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we&#x27;ll get to a proper badminton game.
Badminton aside, running is another pastime that&#x27;s become dearer to me over the last few years. And that&#x27;s a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I&#x27;d like one.

                              <span>Once again I went into the basement of the treehouse - into the very roots, this time - to retrieve one of the reels of tape on which episodes of the bonus podcast Nate Files are recorded. I walked until the ground became unpaved and earthy, and the darkness became velvety. I heard the chittering of many pincers and carapaces colliding, and felt untold small bodies moving around me. Only for you, the supporters, would I make such a journey. I won&#x27;t detail how I made it back alive, but I did, and it is with gratitude that I present this episode of The Nate Files to you. It&#x27;s about ants!

To coincide with the anniversary, Squeenix will be releasing a digital collection of cards on Enjin’s Efinity network for owners of physical cards that are expected to go on sale in 2023. There&#x27;s an NFT linked to a Cloud Strife action figure too. Feel free to watch the trailer for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth below to take your mind off this woeful event.

                              <span>After four hours with Saints Row, it&#x27;s funny being back in the present. I have a gaming PC! Bills to pay! A smartphone that recognises my face! Grey hairs! I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year&#x27;s Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.

                              <span>Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.
The publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft&#x27;s next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. 


Splinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. 
Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities.&quot;

                              <span>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Ubisoft’s open-world title set in James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy universe, will now launch sometime in either 2023 or 2024. The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. 
Unfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”
Ubisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve spent any time on Twitter, you might&#x27;ve seen Stray was released. And you know what? It&#x27;s pretty good! So good, in fact, that cats seem to love it. But what do dogs (the superior pet, if we&#x27;re being honest with ourselves) think about this feline adventure? 
We&#x27;ve enlisted Regan, my real-life chihuahua, to help us play Stray. Watch as she almost certainly immediately falls asleep in my lap while I play the first hour or so. If you have any questions, feel free to jump in chat and ask! 
But that&#x27;s not all. I recently convinced Editor-in-Chief Andrew Reiner to let me use my corporate credit card to buy a Gundam model. So, legally, I now have to do something work-related with it. Let&#x27;s build it on stream. That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s a double feature tonight, folks! Cats and Mecha. What a time to be alive. 
It&#x27;s all going down on our Twitch channel at 3:30 PM Central Time (4:30 PM Eastern / 1:30 PM Pacific). See you there!</span>

                              <span>Every road trip has bumps along the way - unexpected potholes, constant traffic, and extra pit stops. There are stretches of nothingness, and your numb mind tries to pass the time until you reach the destination. Sometimes the open road instills a sense of freedom; other times, you feel trapped. However, the memories that help us power through the tedium often stick – singing along to a classic, having a heart-to-heart conversation, or observing a surprising sight.
In creating a game about a road trip, you could say Gone Home developer Fullbright experienced these highs and lows at every turn. Two years ago, the debut trailer for its third game, Open Roads, was met with excitement. And rightfully so, as it centered on a mother and daughter’s journey to discover more behind their family his…</span>

                              <span>The future of Destiny 2 will be revealed in a livestream showcase set to air on August 23.
Bungie tweeted a cryptic video, posted below, and sent an equally vague press release that simply says to expect “exciting details about what’s next for Destiny 2.” The most likely announcement is an update on the Lightfall expansion, which is technically still scheduled to arrive this year despite The Witch Queen launching only a few months ago (due to a delay). Perhaps Bungie will narrow down that release window, but beyond Lightfall, your guess is as good as ours. 
Witness what&#x27;s next.
