                              <span>Death isn&#x27;t the end with the Breaking Barriers update (unless you want it to be)
With its new Breaking Barriers update, Dead Cells has added a long list of granular accessibility options — including an Assist Mode — to help struggling players pummel the Hand of the King and ultimately rise the (Boss Cells) ranks. It&#x27;s been a long time coming, and for anyone who feels like they&#x27;ve peaked in the game, it&#x27;s time to circle back.
Using Assist Mode toggles, it&#x27;s now possible to reveal the biome&#x27;s map, auto-hit enemies with your primary melee weapon, auto-destroy nearby doors, give yourself more wiggle room to land parries, and make traps slower. Similar to Rogue Legacy 2&#x27;s House Rules, there are also sliders — you can lower trap damage, enemy health, and enemy damage.
Bigger yet, Dead Cells now …</span>

As some of the regular Destructoid clan may know, Final Fight is my favorite game of all time. I&#x27;m not gonna roll out why all over again, who cares, yo? Just know that I&#x27;ve plunged hours upon hours (upon hours) into Capcom&#x27;s legendary brawler, and across myriad platforms — thus, I was left reeling by some recently rediscovered tech, which is hidden away deep inside the grindhouse gutter fighter.

As noted by Japanese arcade aficionado @hijiyan_jp, (with the good word spread by dedicated brawler historian Belt Action Central), it is possible for the player to &quot;break free&quot; from the death grip imposed by some of Metro City&#x27;s meanest villains, such as Andore and Abigail.

Hello Games has locked in a launch date for the Nintendo Switch version of No Man&#x27;s Sky. The studio is partnering with Bandai Namco Entertainment to bring No Man&#x27;s Sky to Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.
This version of Hello Games&#x27; space exploration sim will be available both physically and on the Nintendo eShop. Those picking the game up will get all updates that have been added to the game so far (and there have been a lot), plus all future updates.

While it&#x27;s a bit later than originally intended for the Switch version of No Man&#x27;s Sky, it&#x27;s still wild to see this game make its way to the handheld hybrid console at all.
You can&#x27;t take the sky from me
Since it first launched, No Man&#x27;s Sky has been a wild game to follow. Its initial offering seemed to fall short of the expectations many had for it.
But as time carried on, Hello Games has continued to update and build No Man&#x27;s Sky up, to the point that it feels unrecognizable at times from that initial launch in 2016.
Every once in a while now, we get a new update that adds something huge like smuggling or settlements into the fold. Or, you know, the Normandy from Mass Effect.
We&#x27;ll see how this vast, ever-expanding universe translates to the small form factor later this year. No Man&#x27;s Sky hits Nintendo Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.

Huge news everyone, huuuuuuuge news! It&#x27;s a big week for the Nintendo eShop, as a first-party release heralds in some other fairly big retro re-releases. In case you couldn&#x27;t tell, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (out on June 24) is the golden goose this week, but Sonic Origins and Capcom Fighting Collection are bringing some classic games back on Switch. Then there&#x27;s AI The Somnium Files, ElecHead, and Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrine is coming on June 24.
It&#x27;s a packed week! There&#x27;s new stuff and plenty of old stuff too. And in the case of ElecHead, a new thing that looks old.

Publisher Focus Entertainment has announced a release date for its dour, rat-ridden A Plague Tale: Requiem. The grim follow-up to the great 2019 release A Plague Tale: Innocence will launch October 18 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. A Nintendo Switch port will also be available via cloud gaming. The Xbox edition will also be available via Xbox Game Pass on launch day.
You can check out a brand new gameplay trailer for the stealth adventure below, as premiered during this morning&#x27;s Focus Entertainment Showcase live stream.

                              <span>The Shiny Baneful Fox Mask
The Pokemon Company is currently running a distribution event for a free Pokemon Legends mask: just claim it through the mystery gift functionality!
Confirmed through the Play Pokemon Twitter account, this is indeed a cosmetic mask and not an actual Pokemon distribution, as is customary for most mainline games (on top of functional items like Pokeballs). That same account has confirmed that the distribution event will run from June 22, 2022 through June 1, 2023 at 5AM PT. So if you&#x27;re putting this off for nearly a year, just remember that you need to wake up early that day.
The actual prize is called the &quot;Shiny Baneful Fox Mask,&quot; which is &quot;inspired by the Hisuian Snow animation.&quot; Hey, that&#x27;s still kind of fresh! The third (and final) episode literally just debuted on the official Pokemon YouTube channel this week, featuring a young boy named Alec living in the Pokemon Legends timeline.
There&#x27;s a lot of potential to deliver more innovative mystery gifts like this, and masks in Legends is a decent start. But there&#x27;s so much more the team can do with the system, especially when you consider the last two years leading to a bigger rise in online gaming. Hopefully Scarlet and Violet will capitalize on some of that potential.

                              <span>Not even Rugal would invest
SNK delivered a double dose of news pertaining to its foremost fight franchise The King of Fighters this week, not only offering up a new trailer for The King of Fighters XV&#x27;s Team Orochi, but also stealth-dropping The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Final Edition onto PlayStation platforms. It seems, however, that there was a third piece of KoF news that day... Though you might not find it for looking.
On Tuesday, eagle-eyed fans spotted a new Twitter account advertising something plainly called &quot;The King of Fighters Crypto&quot; (or &quot;CryptoKOF&quot;). This endeavor — not developed by but allegedly &quot;authorized by&quot; SNK — appears to be a blockchain/NFT project based upon the crossover fighting series. According to the Twitter page, The King of Fighters Crypto would see &quot;The return of the king, to fight again in the metaverse arena.&quot;
You already know what happened next. Like so many similar announcements before it, CryptoKOF was immediately hit with insults and comments of disdain from the King of Fighters community, leading the Twitter page to go private within mere hours of its initial discovery. While this is not SNK&#x27;s first dabble in the NFT market (the company already has a deal with online market OnBuff to sell NFTs based on SNK properties), it is yet another example of the gaming community turning toward the blockchain market and telling it — quite succinctly — that it is not welcome here.
And the horse you rode in on, fellas.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s not even finished its world tour
Paramount Pictures has revealed that the blockbuster Sonic sequel is continuing to pull in the punters as it speeds its way through worldwide theaters. As reported by Deadline, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has smashed past an incredible $400 million USD box office since its release in April of this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;47r8FXYZWNU
The movie, already pushing to be the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, sees The Blue Blur (voiced by Ben Schwartz), in a race against the evil Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to recover the fabled Chaos Emeralds. Sonic is assisted on his journey by long-time pal Tails (Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey) and must face down the powerful and mysterious echidna, Knuckles (Idris Elba). The sequel was praised for its comical script and likable characters, but criticized for its length and relatively rote narrative.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently number eight in the Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies of 2022, with the sequel still yet to hit the financially lucrative box office markets of Hong Kong and Japan, which will likely add further coffers to the Paramount Pictures vault. Of course, the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a consistent reminder of how things could have been so different for the cinematic adaptation. Still, it&#x27;s good to know that the &quot;original&quot; movie Sonic still eventually found his way into cinema history.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is available now on streaming services, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for August. Sonic Origins launches today on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>Capcom says &quot;demo save data is needed&quot;
Capcom just announced a Monster Hunter Rise bonus item pack — and it has all sorts of extra consumables ready to go in it. The only catch is that you need to try the Sunbreak demo.
In case you weren&#x27;t aware, Capcom announced the demo roughly a week ago during their &quot;E3&quot; showcase stream, and it went live on June 14. It features a selection of missions, including an ultra hard Malzeno showdown.
Here&#x27;s the list of Monster Hunter Rise bonus items for playing the Sunbreak demo:
60 Mega Potions
15 Pitfall Traps
30 Energy Drinks
15 Mega Demondrugs
15 Mega Armorskins
Capcom also points out that you can get the demo directly here on Steam, or here on Switch. Seems easy enough!
While veterans will likely balk at the items you&#x27;ll get here, newcomers will probably want to take them up on the offer if possible. Having a ton of free items at the start saves you a lot of time, as you can get by most of the early story content through Mega Potions alone; not having to craft them is a huge plus. And you&#x27;ll have that surplus by the time you actually work your way up to the Sunbreak expansion.

                              <span>The bots aren&#x27;t gone forever, but this new update seems like a good first step
Valve has issued a new Team Fortress 2 update. It&#x27;s the first one since the massive #SaveTF2 movement that drew attention to the massive bot problem in Team Fortress 2. And while the new update isn&#x27;t a cure-all, the community seems to feel it&#x27;s a start.
The update, which went live Tuesday evening, addresses several concerns. Among the updates are several that help with the bot problem in Team Fortress 2; users can no longer change names during a matchmaking game, for example. Both teams are able to run kick votes at the same time, as well as a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote. And it cleared out an exploit that allowed bots to clear the in-game chat, disrupting communication.

                              <span>Saving Moonbury one potion at a time
The day I&#x27;ll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I&#x27;m so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven&#x27;t seen it yet, you&#x27;re in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association&#x27;s most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.
Let&#x27;s be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won&#x27;t be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.
https://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032
There&#x27;s a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town&#x27;s inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven&#x27;t gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.
Of everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I&#x27;m probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That&#x27;s just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don&#x27;t want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.
Potion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.

Hey, remember when we made a list of the Best Cat Games On The Nintendo Switch? If you&#x27;re a cat person, you were probably more than satisfied — but what about the poor, forgotten dog people? Fear not, folks. We have you covered, too. In fact, it was a lot harder to narrow down the Best Dog list, although we won&#x27;t pretend to know what that means, since we don&#x27;t want to starts a cats vs dogs war in the comments.
So, here they are — the best dogs, and the best dog games, that you can find on the Nintendo Switch!

Deals on Switch games such as Super Mario Odyssey (we hear it&#x27;s pretty good), The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening (also not shabby), Monster Hunter Rise (another winner), and some little-known, rarely re-released game called Skyrim (never heard of it) are included in the sale.

Anime Expo 2022 is taking place in July, and that means a wave of new merch is rapidly approaching the shore. Atlus has just announced four new plushes as part of that wave: two of Morgana from Persona 5, and Aogami and Nahobino from Shin Megami Tensei V.
The plushes are being made by Stubbins, who have made plushes in the past for Mega Man, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, and more, but this collection marks their first collaboration with Atlus.

Figment 2: Creed Valley is out this October, and in anticipation of the release, Bedtime Digital have put out a new trailer alongside a demo for the game on Switch.
The game is a sequel to the original action-adventure musical game Figment, and follows returning protagonist Dusty and his sidekick bird Piper as they venture through a human mind plagued with demons and nightmares. Like the first game, there will be puzzles, boss fights, and plenty of rhythmic musical action. Unlike the first game, Figment 2 allows two players to adventure together with local co-op.

We&#x27;ve got the latest Japanese charts (thanks, Gematsu) and there are a few minor changes of note. First up, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles retains the top spot this week with 20,964 units sold, but Nintendo Switch Sports and Mario Strikers: Battle League have swapped positions, slightly altering the top three. Mario Strikers&#x27; sales fell off considerably from the previous week, marking a 147% drop in total sales.
Meanwhile, in a rather curious turn of events, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have re-entered the top ten charts with 5,043 units sold, bringing the total sales since the games&#x27; launch to a respectable 2,560,536 units.

                              <span>Steve Jackson will remember that.
Way back in the day, long before video games were any good, the cool new narrative mechanic was Choose Your Own Adventure books. Wildly popular back in the &#x27;70s, &#x27;80s, and &#x27;90s, the CYOA genre died off sharpish with the invention of point-and-click games, text adventures, and video games with vast, sprawling branching stories, which allowed players to have all the fun of meaningful choices without all the tedium of having to turn to page 32 only to find out that you&#x27;ve died, again. Well, you still died a lot. But the computer did the page-turning bit for you, at least.
The CYOA genre came back around full circle in 2013, with Inkle&#x27;s fearless adaptation of the Sorcery! books by the founder of Games Workshop and Lionhead Studios, Steve Jackson. Inkle is a studio known for its mastery of word-wrangling; the very thought of attempting to map out the intricacies of the stories the team writes is enough to send just about any writer screaming for the sweet release of death. It was Sorcery! that catapulted Inkle into the spotlight — and now, with its four-part series ported to the Nintendo Switch, hopefully more people can see why.

One of the photos Naka has shared is from the time when he visited &quot;his&quot; house, presumably Michael Jackson&#x27;s Neverland Ranch in California. Just casually confirming things even more. Someone&#x27;s in a talkative mood today!

Pokémon GO was always designed as a mobile game to get you up, outside, and moving. But back when the pandemic kicked off in 2020, developer Niantic had to change things up considerably to allow people to still play the game while also staying safe at home.
Now, over two years later, as in-person events are returning and people are attempting to get back to a normal way of life, Niantic has started bringing back exclusive in-person raids to its augmented reality game, starting this weekend with a new raid during Community Day. But GO&#x27;s game director Michael Steranka has told Eurogamer that this is a &quot;unique experience&quot; for this weekend, but the company hasn&#x27;t ruled out making more exclusive raids.

                              <span>Blast off later this year.
No Man&#x27;s Sky, Hello Games&#x27; ambitious space epic, has finally secured a release date for the Switch. The good news is you won&#x27;t be waiting too long either, as it will be landing both physically and digitally on October 7th, 2022.
Originally debuting on the PS4 back in 2016, the game was met with decidedly mixed reception thanks to a number of shortcomings and some bold promises from the developer that failed to come to fruition. In the years since, however, its overall standing has been given a major boost thanks to multiple expansions and improvements.

                              <span>Pixels are back in fashion!
We&#x27;re going to be honest with you for a moment: we really miss the 2D art style of the older Pokémon games. There&#x27;s just something timeless about it, right? Not to mention there was a distinct lack of discourse around the graphics back in the day (okay, perhaps a slight resentment from fans at the slow evolution of the series&#x27; visuals, but that&#x27;s about it).
Pokémon&#x27;s visuals, in this writer&#x27;s opinion, really peaked around Gen 5, which consisted of Pokémon Black and White, plus their immediate sequels. Now don&#x27;t get us wrong, we&#x27;re loving the look of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far, but we can&#x27;t help but wonder what such games would look like with the older pixelated visual style in place of the more modern 3D graphics.

Happy 31st birthday to the blue blur! We&#x27;ve seen Sonic the Hedgehog change and evolve tons over the years, and the next step in his journey — Sonic Frontiers — is bringing some of the franchise&#x27;s biggest changes yet. But before we look forward, we&#x27;re looking back today with the launch of Sonic Origins.
The compilation game dropped on consoles today, including Switch, and dataminers have already dived in to see what hidden nuggets they can find. And @ahremic on Twitter has found some leftover files in Origins, but these aren&#x27;t for any of the classic Sonic games, but rather for Frontiers (Thanks, Sonic Stadium and BlueStarEXSF on ResetEra).

Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard, has been successfully re-elected to the company&#x27;s board of directors for another year. The decision was made as a result of the company&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting on June 21st, the outcome of which you can read in full right here.
Activision Blizzard has been embroiled in numerous allegations involving alleged workplace misconduct occurring within the company. Blizzard President J. Allen Brack, who was specifically named in the initial lawsuit, stepped down less than two weeks after those initial allegations in July 2021. In November, over 1300 Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition demanding Kotick&#x27;s resignation. Most recently, the company&#x27;s board of directors came to the conclusion that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of any reported harassment of colleagues being tolerated by company management.

Just recently, we caught a sneaky glimpse at the dedicated workers testing and packing NES consoles back in 1989. While it hardly contained any surprises or revelations into how consoles were manufactured back in the day, it was nevertheless a fascinating look at the fine folks who worked tirelessly to ensure your beloved NES arrived in your hands in pristine condition.
Now, it&#x27;s time to take a look at the SNES. In a new video posted by video game historian John Andersen, we get a lovely glimpse at a SNES assembly line in the UK, with new consoles being bundled with none other than Street Fighter II. Towards the end of the video, we&#x27;re also given a peek at Nintendo&#x27;s Gameplay Counsellors.

                              <span>It’s easy to forget in 2022, now that it feels like we get a new or remastered Yakuza game every six months, that for a very long time the series was MIA from Western shores. In large part this was down to the disastrous decisions made by Sega for the original game’s release back in 2006.

                              <span>There are three reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has subtitles; 2) it has controller support; 3) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

                              <span>Valve are kicking off 2022’s Steam Summer Sale today with discounts on AAA and indie games, starting at 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST. It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.

                              <span>The RTX 3060 is the best value 1080p graphics card, and recently it&#x27;s gotten significantly cheaper as next-gen Nvidia GPUs have been rumoured. Right now, you can pick up a Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle 12GB for just £330 at Scan UK, a £61 reduction over the same card at Amazon UK and some £40 cheaper than the cheapest RTX 3060 we spotted last month. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new GPU and you&#x27;ve got a 1080p monitor, this is an awesome shout.

Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

That&#x27;s a £50 reduction from its normal price, and some £22 cheaper than the CPU and cooler on Amazon. This would make an excellent start to a new system, with the 3600&#x27;s six cores and twelve threads pairing well with a modern RTX 20-series or Radeon RX 5000-series or later graphics card.

Having been a fan of the Vampires and Realm Of Magic (a.k.a. wizards, basically) game packs since their respective releases, I can safely say that Werewolves has done an excellent job iterating and expanding on what worked from those previous supernatural outings.

No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren&#x27;t too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

                              <span>The Biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monstrous antagonists, are as mysterious as they are deadly. To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. 
Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.
“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn&#x27;t have to be real, but it has to feel real, right? That can mean many different things. But in my opinion, it has to be interesti…</span>

                              <span>Welcome back to a new episode of The Game Informer Show! We know what you&#x27;re thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won&#x27;t stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we&#x27;re brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.
Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today&#x27;s podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

                              <span>Update: Yuji Naka has, kind of, walked back his original, unintentional confirmation that Michael Jackson worked on Sonic 3 after years of vaguely proven speculation.  
In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3&#x27;s music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson&#x27;s connection to it. In a follow-up tweet, he posted: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don&#x27;t speak English and I&#x27;m using a translation tool. Sorry.&quot;

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky creator Hello Games has teamed up with Bandai Namco to bring its hit survival title to the Nintendo Switch. We knew from a Nintendo Direct that aired earlier this year the game was coming to the portable console before today&#x27;s announcement. However, the last mention of the project came with a summer release window, which has now been pushed back. But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man&#x27;s Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. 
Fans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.


Looking over the titles&#x27;s long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.
 No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Switch and PS5 remastered editions are set to release on October 7, but you can also purchase a copy of the game on all major platforms.</span>

                              <span>Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.</span>

                              <span>Sega&#x27;s Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and &quot;engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.&quot; The game&#x27;s debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet&#x27;s culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth&#x27;s poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it&#x27;s still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas&#x27; alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.</span>

                              <span>Glen Schoefield has made a name for himself, working on Dead Space, Call of Duty, and even Barbie: Game Girl. Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It&#x27;s Alex Stadnik&#x27;s turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we&#x27;ll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn&#x27;t Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You&#x27;ll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you&#x27;ll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.</span>

The Ghostbusters are back in town and will soon light up specters in a new asymmetrical multiplayer game from IllFonic, the development studio behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds. In an exclusive new look at the studio&#x27;s forthcoming Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, we see four proton packs charge up and ignite against a purple Slimer-like ghost with far too many eyes. This battle unfolds within a prison setting that IlllFonic felt was a must for this game.

The PlayStation Store is hosting three major sales (and a &quot;Deal of the Week&quot; promo on The Sims 4), so there are a lot of discounts floating around right now — even more than normal. There&#x27;s a Mid-Year sale on big PS4 and PS5 games, a Level Up sale on DLC and expansions, and a Games Under $20 sale with indies, hidden gems, and older titles.
Where to start? I never know. I&#x27;m just going to toss out some chaotic recommendations.
Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands ($47.99 for PS4; $71.99 for PS4/PS5 with the Season Pass) and Riders Republic ($23.99) are two games I ended up enjoying far more than I would&#x27;ve expected.

                              <span>Padding it out
Microsoft has confirmed that it is currently experiencing a shortage in supply and demand for its range of Xbox controllers. The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.
&quot;We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. &quot;We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability.&quot;
The shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox&#x27;s cool custom &quot;Design Lab&quot; models are affected.
Hardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide. From consoles to graphics cards to controllers, publishers are struggling to produce their wares with the speed and regularity of previous generations. It is a problem expected to continue into 2023 at the very least.

                              <span>Add some Steam to the factory
Fantasy farmers will have a new way to mingle and mine in Rune Factory 5 soon. XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.
The latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It&#x27;s $59.99 for the standard edition (though it&#x27;s currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.

Farming up a storm
If you&#x27;re new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.
Depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.
What a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I&#x27;m hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.
Rune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.

Indie publisher Digerati has announced that DreadOut 2, the sequel to cult streaming favorite DreadOut, will be bringing its ghostly goings-on to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in July, following on from its initial release on PC way back in 2020.
https://youtu.be/EjkwgcI5hNI
DreadOut 2, much like the 2014 original, is a scare-heavy survival horror title developed by studio Digital Happiness. A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl &quot;Linda Meillinda,&quot; (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.
Explore Ms. Mellinda&#x27;s hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it&#x27;s no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.
DreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.

Ever since the &quot;Wiiwaa&quot; concept (marrying a plush toy and a mascot-based Wii game) debuted, my wife and I have been waiting for it to someday become a reality. We even waited past the nebulous announcement and the complete lack of news surrounding it. And we&#x27;re waiting to this day for this thing to still come out: even if there&#x27;s a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell of that happening.
Although there&#x27;s been bits and bobs of news surrounding, famed game researcher Liam Robertson has provided what can be considered the definitive word: even speaking to the development team to get an update. It&#x27;s dead, Jim. And the thing that ultimately helped killed it, after it clawed its way up out of hell multiple times (including a name change to WeeWaa)? Cooking Mama.

                              <span>The Silver Fox
Surprise! Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today&#x27;s DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;BqaHE0JwIJ8
The Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters&#x27; Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.
Lost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I&#x27;m still pretty much at a loss for who I&#x27;m gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon&#x27;s underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.

                              <span>Make war for nostalgia&#x27;s sake
Sega unveiled the new game it had previously teased today, and it&#x27;s a bit out of left field. Hyenas is a new sci-fi FPS from Creative Assembly, where players compete to steal and plunder caches of merch for the rich.
The premiere arrives as part of IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming, and was teased yesterday with a little sound bite.
Hyenas pits packs of players against each other in a bid to steal some merch. Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0694XcFmI7M
It looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and &quot;irreverent&quot; tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you&#x27;d want.
Scraps of nostalgia
Hyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We&#x27;ve seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042&#x27;s Hazard Zone.
What seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It&#x27;s taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik&#x27;s Cube.
Creative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;m sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game&#x27;s website.
Otherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.

                              <span>The PC gets four more toggles
Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise camera system is getting upgraded when Sunbreak arrives, on both Switch and PC. The catch? PC users will be getting even more enhancements.
Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the features found on the game&#x27;s official Twitter account.
https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1539211771004821505
Here&#x27;s what the Switch Monster Hunter Rise camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Here&#x27;s what the PC camera upgrades look like (visible here):
The ability to hide the UI
A face [the] camera option
A face [the] camera with buddies option
Depth of field toggles (DOF)
A focus option
Blur range
Filter swaps
Folks are already celebrating the hilarious nature in which the NPCs and the player character &quot;face the camera.&quot; Once you hit the option it forces them, seemingly against their will, to slowly turn and look at the screen. Others are loving the &quot;face the camera with buddies&quot; toggle — and as someone who laboriously attempted to set up tons of &quot;face the camera&quot; pictures on my own without the help of an instant click, I can relate.
Again, these features will arrive with the launch of Sunbreak on June 30.

Studio DICE has stated that it intends to entirely focus its efforts on the beleaguered Battlefield franchise going forward, eschewing new IPs and alternate franchises such as the studio&#x27;s cult series Mirror&#x27;s Edge while it ensures Battlefield 2042 becomes the team&#x27;s core release.
Speaking in her first interview since taking the role, DICE&#x27;s new General Manager Rebecka Coutaz told GamesIndustry.biz that the Battlefield franchise was the now core focus of the studio. In particular, Coutaz notes that DICE is committed to its long-term plans for blah shooter Battlefield 2042, with support expected to roll out for another three years at the very least. Asked about whether this meant Mirror&#x27;s Edge or any other projects were off-the-table, Coutaz was very clear about DICE&#x27;s directio…</span>

                              <span>Well that&#x27;s confusing!
There&#x27;s a lot of pressure on Kingdom Hearts IV given its drastically different setting and the fact that it&#x27;s a start of a new journey: something series boss Tetsuya Nomura is painfully aware of. Speaking to Game Informer, he tackled the subject of Final Fantasy characters appearing in the series (or a lack thereof). Here&#x27;s what Nomura had to say on the Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy crossover situation.
Basically, the reason the first game had a chunk of Final Fantasy characters in it is because Nomura and his team wanted to ease people into the world. He describes the Final Fantasy cast as &quot;lending a hand&quot; to get to know the Kingdom Hearts original creations. But once that whole universe got off the ground, they essentially served their purpose:

Final Fantasy XVI may be ratcheting up the scale, but its world won&#x27;t be going fully open. In a new interview, producer Naoki Yoshida discusses the design philosophy behind the world of Final Fantasy XVI, saying it won&#x27;t be an open-world RPG.
In an interview with IGN, Yoshida says players might notice inspiration from recent AAA open-world RPGs. But in order to deliver the story the team wants to make, it won&#x27;t be one big, contiguous space.
&quot;We’ve found in our extensive user research that many of the younger generation of gamers have never played a Final Fantasy or don’t have any interest in the series,&quot; Yoshida says. &quot;To create a game that might excite and resonate not only with our core fans, but also with that new generation, we played a…</span>

If, like my good self, you&#x27;ve been keeping one eye on Izanagi Games&#x27; weird, melodramatic shmup Yurukill: The Calumniation Games, then here&#x27;s some fine news: You can check out the entire first chapter of the incoming release today, via a new PC demo available right now on Steam. (A demo is already available on PlayStation platforms.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iQ7XL0ksQLY
As a quick refresher, Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is an unnerving new release that sees convicted felons forced to team up with their victims in order to survive a bizarre tournament of death — presided over by &quot;Binko,&quot; an attractive woman in a sinister fox mask. Yurukill hopes to marry the fast-paced, pulse-pounding action of a G.rev-developed shmup with the heavy social deduction drama of a Danganronpa, all bedecked in attractive anime artwork and, of course, starring a cast of ridiculously hot hipsters. The story has been written by Homura Kawamoto of Kakegurui fame, so expect plenty of high drama and state-smashing anarchy.
The Steam demo will offer players the first chapter of Yurukill in its entirety, which will certainly give you a taste of the title&#x27;s mood, atmosphere, and genre-blending gameplay. I&#x27;ve been hugely intrigued by this title ever since its initial announcement, so I&#x27;m definitely hoping to get to this demo later today to check out the action for myself. Oh, and should you pull the trigger on a full purchase, then your demo save data will be carried over into the main release.
Yurukill: The Calumniation Games launches in North America, July 5, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

In case you missed it, there&#x27;s a six-episode Xbox documentary out now that deals with the history of the console line from the germination of the idea of the brand, through the success of Halo, into the red ring of death, to now. It&#x27;s called &quot;Power On: The Story of Xbox,&quot; and it&#x27;s interesting in the sense that it&#x27;s officially sanctioned (thus provided full access to current and former Xbox team members and archive footage), but also doesn&#x27;t hold back.
Big dramatic highlights of the Power On Xbox Documentary include:
How scrappy the team was in terms of getting the idea off the ground, and the many barriers to entry that almost stopped the project cold
The larger-than-life personality of Bill Gates, and how easily he could have sunk the project (or any project or team member …</span>

Spoiler shield in case you want to go in blind!

We got some more story bits
The Direct kicked off with a trailer, which provided a brief look at the cabal-like group that is seemingly the antagonist faction. Then it immediately led into a crucial story conceit: &quot;terms.&quot; 10 years is a &quot;term&quot; of life in which some &quot;fight continually&quot; as soldiers, then die. So like even-more-short-lived Clone troopers from Star Wars! All of this was accompanied by a lovely vocal ballad, which just goes to show us that the soundtrack will continue to kick ass.

Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that the PlayStation brand will not be in attendance at this summer&#x27;s Gamescom 2022 event, nor will it be featured as part of the Opening Night Live stream.
Speaking in an interview with German publication Games Wirtschaft, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed that the PS5 and its respective wares would not be putting in an appearance at this year&#x27;s event, which takes place in Cologne, Germany in late August, PlayStation joins several other major brands including Blizzard Entertainment, Nintendo, and Take-Two who will be staying home this summer. It is likely that PlayStation is happy with the news and updates offered on its upcoming titles during the recent Sony State of Play and Summer Game Fest presentations.
This year sees Gamescom return in a physical capacity for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced restrictions on global travel and social gatherings. Gamescom 2022 has been described as a &quot;hybrid&quot; event by organizers, and will feature a host of online streams and activities in addition to its live show — which is once again being held in Cologne&#x27;s Koelnmesse center. Gamescom, as always, will kick off with a special Opening Night Live stream, hosted by Geoff Keighley.
Gamescom 2022 will take place from August 24-28. You can check out more info and details pertaining to the event and its respective activities over on the official Gamescom website. We will, of course, be bringing you all of the top headlines over the course of the week right here on Destructoid.

It&#x27;s wild to think that we were talking about Junker Queen in the original Overwatch five years ago — where has the time gone? With the sequel coming into focus and trying its best to justify itself (now as a free-to-play, battle-pass-powered game), the long-time-coming tank hero has stepped &quot;out of the lore and into the light,&quot; as Blizzard puts it.
&quot;Tanks play more aggressively in Overwatch 2,&quot; and as one of the first new characters for the game&#x27;s Season 1 launch, Junker Queen has to exemplify that shift. Players can charge into battle, wound their opponents, and stay in the fight with a life-leech passive.

Insane, custom gaming builds are a favorite of the internet, hence why they tend to go viral pretty much every time. A new project has been making the rounds on Reddit, and it&#x27;s one of the coolest builds I&#x27;ve seen in a long time: a giant working Xbox Series X. According to his YouTube channel, a user called PhantomSpectre, or Michael Pick, was inspired after seeing the Xbox Series X refrigerator (and subsequent mini-fridge) that was created by Microsoft back in 2020 as a response to comments online that the new console was built like a fridge.
While that refrigerator was indeed running (and then spawned a series of lackluster mini fridges that also looked like the Series X), Pick thought it would be cool to have a console that big that actually worked as a console. The bu…</span>

Ahead of the release of Cuphead&#x27;s new DLC, named &quot;The Delicious Last Course&quot;, Nintendo and Studio MDHR have given us a little sneak-peek at some of the music.

Nihon Falcom&#x27;s longest-running series, Ys, celebrated its 35th anniversary yesterday, and fans of red-headed adventurer Adol are eagerly awaiting his next big journey — probably with a shipwreck or two in his wake.
And in this week&#x27;s issue of Famitsu, Falcom president Toshiro Kondo has shared some pretty gorgeous-looking key art from the next Ys title — presumably Ys X — which we&#x27;ve embedded at the top here.

                              <span>Quentin Tarantino has asked a California court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit filed by Miramax against his &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; NFT project. The director&#x27;s legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company&#x27;s claims fall flat. The Pulp Fiction film is a derivative of the screenplay, not the other way around, they stress.

                              <span>When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that&#x27;s very boring, but it&#x27;s also positive, isn&#x27;t it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I&#x27;ll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it&#x27;s directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it&#x27;s going to be accessible if you&#x27;re new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it&#x27;s possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

                              <span>I love the name &quot;SpellForce&quot;, mid-word capital letter and all. It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

                              <span>Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

                              <span>So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified &quot;violation of related laws and regulations&quot;.

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

                              <span>The Acter Nitro 5 is a strong if unremarkable gaming laptop, offering excellent performance for the money in a rather typical gamer-y design. It doesn&#x27;t look quite as cool as a Razer Blade or as beautifully thick as an XMG Apex 15, but it&#x27;s got it where it counts: inside. Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP.

                              <span>Big enough for the whole Bat Family
WB Montreal&#x27;s Gotham Knights is sounding like a pretty big game. Or at least big in square mileage, when it comes to the city of Gotham.
In an interview with Game Informer, Gotham Knights game director Geoff Ellenor emphasizes the Batcycle&#x27;s usefulness for getting around Gotham.
&quot;It&#x27;s pretty big. I haven’t put one map over the other, but our Gotham is a big place. I tend to spend a lot of my Zoom calls on the Batcyle driving around Gotham. It is one of the fastest and most chill ways to move around the city. It feels like a big place.&quot;
Gotham Knights executive producer Fleur Marty follows it up with a more direct comparison to how big this portrayal of Batman&#x27;s home will be.
&quot;For sure it’s the biggest version of Gotham that has been represented in video games,&quot; said Fleur. &quot;The most important thing for us is its density and verticality. It has a lot of layers. The Batcycle is the long-range mode of transportation.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;sFtYcS3DPfM
Knight court
That&#x27;s a big Gotham then, if we&#x27;re comparing it to the likes of Arkham Knight. Good to know the Batfamily may have lost Bruce but kept some wheels around.
As for other tidbits from Game Informer&#x27;s coverage, the pair also addresses what happens when two players pick the same character. It sounds like it&#x27;s not only possible, but has some funny ramifications.
&quot;We’re leaving it up to players.,&quot; said Fleur. &quot;We know some people will want to have different characters, but some won’t care. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there’s a funny moment in the game if you are playing as two of the same character.&quot;
I&#x27;m hoping for a &quot;two Robins walk into a bar&quot; joke somewhere. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on Oct. 25, 2022.

                              <span>Gaara and more join the battle royale
This week, Fortnite gets even more Naruto characters in the mix. Four more characters from the manga and anime series are dropping into Fortnite&#x27;s Item Shop on June 23, this Thursday.
The four candidates chosen this time around are some recognizable faces, even if you&#x27;re not too familiar with Naruto. Itachi Uchiha and Orochimaru bring some menacing presence to the field, while Gaara is the rival-turned-ally of the group. Also joining the crew is Hinata, a Hyuga clan Shinobi who grows close to the cast, especially Naruto.
Add these to the already added Naruto characters in Fortnite, like Sasuke and the titular shinobi, and you&#x27;ve got a lot of options for fans of the ninja-themed series.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;np7xNgjFqdw
Alongside the skins themselves, there are also a bunch of backpacks, gliders, and emotes to pick up as part of this &quot;Rivals&quot; drop. There are bundles too, packing together some of the characters, cosmetics, and some loading screens as well. You can find the full rundown here.
Return to the village
Additionally, from 8 p.m. ET on June 23 to 8 p.m. ET on July 7, the gates to the Hidden Leaf Village Map will open up again. The adventure area has plenty of locations to explore, as well as quests to complete and unlock more areas. Nindo Community Challenges are also back, oepning up today to earn some cosmetic rewards.
Now, I&#x27;m not the biggest Naruto fan, so these admittedly do little for me. But if I may still make a humble request: if we&#x27;re going to keep adding Naruto characters to Fortnite, Rock Lee needs to be in the picture.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…</span>

                              <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, &quot;Chaotic Great Edition.&quot; The latter includes the game&#x27;s season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. &quot;This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,&quot; Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland is really good. As we said, it&#x27;s &quot;upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.&quot;</span>

                              <span>The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. 
Of course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there&#x27;s more to it than PlayStation&#x27;s ever-growing list of really expensive games.
I had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. 
To my delight, it&#x27;s full of weirdo games you probably haven&#x27;t heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of &quot;Does this look weird and/or interesting?&quot; It&#x27;s been a blast. 
I finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It&#x27;s also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. 
I also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It&#x27;s an objectively bad game but I can&#x27;t help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she&#x27;s evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it&#x27;s bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.
Next up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can&#x27;t wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you&#x27;re finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that&#x27;s a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.


Join Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn&#x27;s dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what&#x27;s happening on the moon.
While that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can&#x27;t go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you&#x27;ll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.
If that&#x27;s not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.

                              <span>Remakes of Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. 
According to Hawk, the &quot;plan&quot; was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. 
&quot;The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn&#x27;t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,&quot; Hawk says in the clip. &quot;Like, &#x27;What would you do with a THPS title?&#x27; And they didn&#x27;t like anything they heard, and then that was it.&quot;
You can watch the full clip below: 
Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔

At the very least, it doesn&#x27;t sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision&#x27;s interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that&#x27;s been a bad idea.  
The news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  &quot;the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.&quot; Alas, history proves otherwise. 
But actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there&#x27;s Vicarious Visions&#x27; Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater reboot. There&#x27;s also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.</span>

                              <span>Darth Vader was apparently sick and tired of being trapped in Fortnite&#x27;s Battle Pass and is now waging war against all players. In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won&#x27;t hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you&#x27;ll get his lightsaber as a reward.
Vader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It&#x27;ll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.
Vader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He&#x27;s also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. 
His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don&#x27;t know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it&#x27;s awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here&#x27;s hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!</span>

                              <span>RiotPWR has revealed a new controller specifically designed for Xbox cloud gaming on mobile devices, and it looks great. 
RiotPWR is no stranger to creating controllers with mobile gaming in mind, but today’s reveal is the result of a collaboration and partnership with Xbox. The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. 


“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” 
This controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1.

                              <span>Starting today, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can dive into the wonderful Shadowrun Trilogy on cloud and console. Developed by Hairbrained Schemes and Codeglue and published by Paradox Interactive, these strategic RPGs draw heavily from the boardgame universe and have great stories to tell. The trilogy consists of Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director&#x27;s Cut, and Shadowrun: Hong Kong – Extended Edition.
In Game Informer&#x27;s review of Shadowrun Returns, Matt Miller says the &quot;isometric view, turn-based combat, point-and-click controls, and text-driven dialogue deliver a jolt of nostalgia for longtime PC gamers. Fifteen years ago, games like this established the foundations of today’s Western RPGs. Even so, there’s nothing here that should turn away newcomers thanks to smart updates t…</span>

While fans often debate the merits of modern Sonic the Hedgehog video games, the consensus is that the ‘90s were the franchise’s most consistently great years. Sonic Origins gathers the four games most attributed to that notion, delivering a stellar group of classic titles at its core. But through several modernizations and updates, Sonic Origins makes a strong case for being the best official way to experience Sonic’s heyday in 2022.

These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I&#x27;ve found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

                              <span>One of the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City itself, a loud and colourful place full of interesting details and decorations. I explored loads on foot, I explored more with the mod adding trains V can ride, and today I&#x27;ve explored even more with a mod adding hovercars. It&#x27;s very cool, and I have only crashed about a hundred times.

                              <span>I realised earlier that today was the last day of Steam Next Fest, and I panicked. I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn&#x27;t the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I&#x27;ve left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

                              <span>The blue hedgehog is back! He goes very fast in his latest instalment, Sonic Frontiers! And lots of fans – naturally – think it looks terrible! The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I&#x27;d like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance &#x27;em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron&#x27;s tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that&#x27;s your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they&#x27;re shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

                              <span>Dinosaurs are cool and scary right? Spiders aren’t so great but they’re definitely biologically intimidating to humans too. Combine the two and you get Shantae developers WayForward’s Spidersaurs, which describes itself as a 2D co-op run’n’gun action game. It’s coming to Steam soon, say WayForward. Try not to get the theme tune stuck in your head when you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Of all the demos featured in this past week’s Steam Next Fest, indie environmental ‘reverse city-builder’ Terra Nil has performed exceedingly well for itself. The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

Elite Boss Tech have agreed to pay Bungie $13.5 million (£11 million). The agreement includes a permanent injunction against Elite Boss Tech that prohibits them from making more software that infringes on Bungie’s. Details of the stipulated consent judgement between the two companies, which has yet to be signed off by the court, were reported by Torrentfreak.

                              <span>A US court has ordered the former operators of pirate IPTV service Nitro TV to pay more than $100m in piracy damages to broadcaster DISH. While the defendants are likely to be somewhat upset, major Hollywood studios are absolutely fuming. Despite their lawsuit against Nitro being filed months earlier, it&#x27;s still not over, allowing DISH to strike first against any available cash.

                              <span>Hot off the reveal that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 is called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about remakes, their purpose in video games, and what games need and don’t need them. 
As a bottom line, I’m not opposed to any remake. If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever. Plus, at the end of the day, in many cases, the original game is still there for me to play should I wish to do that. 


However, all this talk and speculation…</span>

                              <span>It’s been a wild month of video game announcements, updates, trailers, and more courtesy of June’s gaming showcase schedule. Between the 2022 Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase, Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, and the third-party PlayStation State of Play, people have been expecting Nintendo to announce its own June gaming direct. 
And it finally has, but it might not be the more general one you were expecting. That’s because Nintendo has revealed that a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 direct is happening this week. 
Tune in on 6/22 at 7am PT for a livestreamed #XenobladeChronicles3 Direct presentation featuring roughly 20 minutes of information about the upcoming RPG adventure for #NintendoSwitch. pic.twitter.com/x3pRs0EYRA
June 20, 2022
As you can see, this direct is not going to be the one many people were expecting; you know, the one where Nintendo discusses its plans for the rest of 2022 regarding the Switch. Instead, we’re getting 20 minutes of Nintendo’s next big release, Xenoblade Chronicles 3. If you’re excited about Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, then Wednesday is going to be your favorite day this week. 
While waiting for the direct, check out the reveal trailer of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and then read about how its release date moved from September to July.

What would happen to Gotham City if Batman stopped protecting it? We&#x27;ll soon find out in Warner Bros. Montreal&#x27;s Gotham Knights, a story-based action/RPG that begins with Batman&#x27;s death. As criminals try to take advantage of Batman&#x27;s absence, his understudies are trying to keep order. Batgirl, Red Hood, Robin, and Nightwing unite to maintain order, but quickly learn Gotham now bends to the will of the mysterious Court of Owls.

                              <span>Evil West is the upcoming Wild West action game from developer Flying Wild Hog, the studio behind the fast-paced Shadow Warrior series, and it’s due out this September. It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. 
Now, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. 
Check it out for yourself below: 

As you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. 
For more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West.

That’s because apparently, the lyrics in most Elden Ring songs are completely gibberish and void of meaning. This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. Organi confirmed that most of the lyrics are gibberish, and they even apparently reached out to an Elden Ring music producer to verify their findings.


“I am a Latin student, and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs,” Organi writes on the PlayStation 5 subreddit. “The fir…</span>

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.
Releasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come.

                              <span>An amusing irony of working an anti-piracy job is that people immediately render themselves redundant when they&#x27;re 100% effective. With that scenario unlikely to ever raise its head, anti-piracy jobs are in abundance. Whether you prefer site-blocking,  IPTV disruption, or just want camcording movie pirates brought to justice, there is no shortage of jobs in the UK right now.

                              <span>Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.
Murph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot&#x27;s announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.
Below are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. 

In a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: 
“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”
If you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You&#x27;d be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.
Where on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM&#x27;s Toomgis? How about with the McDonald&#x27;s Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>A new Game of Thrones series is reportedly in the works, and it will reunite fans with Jon Snow after the events of the show’s finale. 
The Hollywood Reporter states that HBO has begun developing the live-action spin-off series, reporting that Kit Harrington is attached to reprise his role as Jon Snow should it proceed. HBO and Kit Harrington’s representatives did not respond to THR’s request for comment. 
Fans last saw the character in the Season 8 finale, which saw him venture beyond the Wall after being exiled from Westeros. A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. 
Another Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It&#x27;s far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin&#x27;s best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development.

                              <span>E3 2022, of course, didn&#x27;t take place. Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley&#x27;s Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there&#x27;s something about the current setup for the game industry&#x27;s biggest info dump of the year that&#x27;s leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.
What I&#x27;d like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…</span>

The first original IP developed by the prolific studio in over 25 years, Starfield is expected to redefine science fiction RPGs with unparalleled ambition, boasting considerable customization options and scale. I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. 
Sunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets. All open for you to explore.” On cue, the camera zoomed out, revealing countless nodes on an overwhelmingly extensiv…</span>

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is coming to consoles and PC later this year as an Early Access free-to-play title. With that change in business model, Blizzard Entertainment is now offering a bundle for the unreleased game with plenty of cosmetics and extras, including beta access. However, it&#x27;s going to set you back about the full price of a game.
Clocking in at $39.99, Overwatch 2&#x27;s first content bundle, dubbed the Overwatch Watchpoint Pack, does include a game you can play right now. It&#x27;s the Legendary Edition of the original Overwatch which comes with some additional skins for characters and is probably necessary for the next piece of the bundle; purchasers will also be granted access to the upcoming Overwatch 2 beta, which starts on June 28. When the game launches into Early Access proper in October, the Watchpoint Pack covers the cost of the initial season pass and grants skins, in-game currency, and more.
Here are the entire contents of the Watchpoint Pack: 
Guaranteed access to the Overwatch 2 PvP Crossplay Beta (Beta begins June 28th, 2022)
Overwatch: Legendary Edition (includes five (5) Legendary Skins and five (5) Epic Skins)
Additional content granted to purchasers at the release of Overwatch 2 on October 4th
Premium Battle Pass: Season 1 - Two (2) Overwatch
2 Legendary Hero Skins - Space Raider Soldier 76 and Space Raider Cassidy
2000 Overwatch 2 Virtual Currency - Overwatch
2 Player Icon (Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack pre-purchase exclusive)
The Overwatch 2 Watchpoint Pack is available on all platforms Overwatch 2 which will be available: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Early Access of OW2 starts on October 4, and includes a new character, The Junker Queen. Our own Brian Shea spoke with the Overwatch team about this upcoming game and shift to free-to-play, and you can read his preview of it here.</span>

The updated version of the PSP classic features HD visuals and updated character models. It also includes full voiceover and a rearranged soundtrack.

                              <span>Square Enix not only revealed Final Fantasy VII’s second game, Rebirth, during today&#x27;s 25th Anniversary presentation. It also answered a question fans have asked since this whole thing started: how many games does the saga consist of?
It turns out the answer is three. Executive producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed that there’s only one untitled game left after Rebirth launches next year. Following a three-game roadmap is fitting given that the original Final Fantasy VII consisted of three discs on PS1. Kitase, unsurprisingly, did not give a window for when the final game will arrive.

                              <span>At long last, the second chapter of Final Fantasy VII Remake was revealed during today’s 25th anniversary stream. It’s called Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and it launches next winter, or towards the end of 2023, for PlayStation 5. 
A cinematic trailer provided tantalizing glimpses of what’s to come, most notably gameplay of Cloud and Sephiroth exploring a section of the world together. While that may very well be a flashback, those who played Remake know that anything is possible at this point. Today&#x27;s video also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second entry in what will be a three-game series.

                              <span>As part of Capcom&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 10th-anniversary celebrations, a sequel has finally been announced. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.


The announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that&#x27;s passed since Dragon&#x27;s Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game&#x27;s director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma II,&quot; which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.
Before the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma. It&#x27;s a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.
There&#x27;s no date for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company&#x27;s RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.

The industry group filed a lawsuit against the music video maker Vinkle and sent cease-and-desist letters to nearly 100 other infringing apps. Meanwhile, Google and Apple are put on formal notice and requested to take swift action.

                              <span>After obtaining broad injunctions to take down pirate sites, Israel-based media companies accused Cloudflare of failing to take action, in contempt of court. Cloudflare has now fired back, describing the move as a legally unstable &quot;power grab,&quot; but that&#x27;s just the beginning. Overnight, Google, EFF, and industry group CCIA intervened to express concern over the scale of the injunctions.

                              <span>Not E3 2022 is over. It&#x27;s done. I think? I mean there&#x27;s a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can&#x27;t start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point. Do you want to live in a world where Geoff Keighley
 is allowed to drop a World Premiere at 4PM on Christmas Day? It doesn&#x27;t bear thinking about, really, does it.

                              <span>There&#x27;s something so intriguing about a new survival game. You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

I am delighted to see some of the gentle pleasure and wonder of that captured in Naiad, an upcoming game about a water spirit adventuring downstream.

                              <span>I confess, I was worried about revolutionary robot Soulslike Steelrising. I&#x27;d seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it&#x27;s all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

Thank you once again from the bottom of our massive elephant hearts to our lovely supporters, who let us have lovely silly chats like this.

He went with DMC. But that punchfest has been out for years so...? Yes! Capcom last night announced Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, following a nice presentation where the devs reminisced about making the first game.

                              <span>Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that &quot;an objective review&quot; from external advisors &quot;determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence &quot;suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board.&quot;
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that &quot;there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units&quot; in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, &quot;based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.&quot; You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.

                              <span>Square Enix’s 25th anniversary livestream for Final Fantasy VII played out in almost textbook fashion for the JRPG giants, starting and ending with the two most important pieces of news for PC players. First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part. Gawp at Sephiroth’s broad shoulders from behind by watching the trailer below.

Chyba je označena jako CVE-2022–21123 a jde v podstatě o nedostatečné smazání sdílené vyrovnávací paměti procesoru, kudy by mohly lokálně uniknout citlivé informace mezi dvěma procesy.</span>

                              <span>Grab a pizza slice, kick back, and watch us take on the Foot Clan in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge! Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.
Shredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”

We’ve been hearing about Overwatch 2 since 2019, but nearly three years later, the game still hasn&#x27;t been released. Through tumultuous development and terrible company-culture news out of Activision Blizzard, the Overwatch 2 development team has continued working on the game. As revealed on Sunday, the competitive multiplayer component will launch into early access on October 4. Today, Blizzard gave fans an additional glimpse of what to expect when this highly anticipated shooter sequel launches. We also hopped on a ca…</span>

                              <span>This past week, we&#x27;ve witnessed an obscene amount of trailers featuring promising upcoming games, many of which are coming from talented independent developers. Events like Steam&#x27;s Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.
The ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of &quot;show floor&quot; demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren&#x27;t complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.
Xbox isn&#x27;t ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.
Batora: Lost Haven
Broken Pieces
Severed Steel
Tinykin
Some of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can&#x27;t wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.</span>

                              <span>Digimon Survive makes its way to stores in July, and a new English trailer gives fans a gameplay overview for the visual novel meets strategy title.
The story centers on protagonist Takuma Momozuka, a student on a school camping trip where he and his friends find their way to the Digital World. Each finds a Digimon partner – with Takuma befriending Agumon – and must find a way back to their world. The game’s drama unfolds in a visual novel style, and players can use a cellphone to scan the environment for hidden clues. Combat adopts a turn-based strategy format complete with a grid battlefield. The video also shows off the evolution chart displaying the digivolution paths your critters can take.

                              <span>During his Summer Game Fest Showcase, Geoff Keighley was going to surprise reveal The Last of Us Part I, the long-rumored remake of the 2013 title. However, PlayStation seemingly had other (accidental) plans as the publisher leaked everything about Part I hours before its official reveal. 
Keighley and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann took shots at PlayStation during the showcase, and it was clear the two were upset about the leak. Nonetheless, The Last of Us remake is real, and it’s out on Sept. 2. With all that behind it now, fans have begun to focus on the visual updates of Part I, which has seemingly split the community.

                              <span>Pirate streaming apps are leading the entertainment category in Brazil&#x27;s Google Play Store. These unauthorized streaming apps draw a massive audience and beat official streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney, and HBO in download rankings. While piracy is a worldwide phenomenon, Brazil certainly stands out.

                              <span>Valorant is getting a new map with the release of Episode 5 Act 1 on June 22nd. It&#x27;s called Pearl and it&#x27;s set in an underwater town in Portugal. That sounds interesting, but the same update will also see the removal of Split, one of Valorant&#x27;s original three levels.

The Gangs DLC introduces - no surprise - new gangs to your prison and expands their significance, allowing them to grow in power by recruiting new members and forcing you to struggle to rehabilitate them. The free update, meanwhile, includes bug fixes and a handful of new features.

In a new trailer showing more of its colourful goo-hoovering, the previously vague &quot;2022&quot; was upgraded to the somewhat more specific &quot;fall 2022&quot;.

                              <span>Resident Evil modders have had an eventful week. First, Capcom released a free update for Resident Evils 2, 3 and 7 Biohazard which introduced ray tracing and higher framerates. Unfortunately, the update also broke every existing mod for those games, with no quick fix available.

All&#x27;s well that ends well, though. In response to &quot;overwhelming community response&quot;, Capcom have made the previous versions of the games available again, so that those wishing to use mods can roll back if they wish.

Admittedly, &quot;world record&quot; is less impressive when only developers and media have played, and I expect to be toppled soon after it launches today. Point is: while writing this post about how much I adore the speedrunning FPS, several times I&#x27;ve had ideas about how I might make that record time even faster, so I&#x27;ve stopped writing, dropped into Neon White for a few minutes, and come back out with a new record. I adore this game, and I might never finish this post.

                              <span>My biggest question about Starship Troopers Colon Terran Command was what tone it would strike. The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.


Terran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it&#x27;s a little short on narrative flavour, unless you&#x27;re really into exploring the setting, it&#x27;s got enough tactical heft to make up for it.

Imogen (RPS in peace) spoke with him earlier this year about the game&#x27;s gaslamp fantasy setting and why they chose to enter the survival genre gauntlet, among many other things. At this year&#x27;s Summer Geoff Fest, I caught up with Flynn for another quick chat. This time, we dug into the game&#x27;s recently revealed card crafting and realm-hopping features, as well as the choices you might make along the way.

                              <span>This week Matthew and Nate are both away, but luckily I&#x27;m joined by two very special guests to discuss our favourite games from Summer Geoff Fest and the Not E3 2022 steams and showcases this past weekend. Rebecca from our guides team has been doing exhaustive work doing live chats and roundups for almost all the streams, and Edders was actually out in Los Angeles to play some games and chat to people. He even saw St. Geoff in the flesh. Wowser!

                              <span>The auto-attacking action of Vampire Survivors and rude &#x27;tude of Flash games combines in Brotato, an upcoming indie game with a free demo available in the Steam Next Fest right now. We play as a potato dodging around waves of aliens while blasting them with sticks, stones, guns, knives, rocket launchers, and weird mutations. I mean it as a great compliment when I say the roguelikelike arena survive &#x27;em up feels like a Newgrounds game.

                              <span>Infinifactory developers Zachtronics have revealed what they say is their last game, Last Call BBS. It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.

                              <span>Listen, there’s no reason to beat around the bush with this one. Anger Foot is amazing. It was amazing when I played its early build last year, and its Steam Next Fest demo is somehow even better. How could it not be! Have you seen it? Anger Foot is a game about kicking doors at muppet men. That’s it. That’s the pitch. It rules.

                              <span>Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.

                              <span>DDR5 RAM arrived late last year, but it&#x27;s taken until now to see the first semi-reasonable prices for a kit of next-generation memory. CCL are currently selling a kit of Crucial DDR5-4800 for £89.94, more than £30 cheaper than the same kit is on Amazon. 
This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a DDR5 kit of any description under £100, so if you&#x27;re considering a 12th-gen Intel (or AMD Ryzen 7000) build, then this might be just what you need.

It has a demo in the Steam Next Fest and I think I want more? I was drawn in by screenshots of vast Gothic architecture, put off by frustrating slowness, then kept interested by the mysteries of our fella adrift in his former home. It does, at the very least, have pleasingly giant buildings rising from fog.

We touched on the game&#x27;s &quot;beta paths&quot;, its gore system, upgrades, and batteries. There was a lot of chat about batteries. Forgot to ask if they were AA or AAA, though.

It’s a basic button-mashing affair that offers nothing new, but that facilitated a good old chinwag that I didn&#x27;t know I needed.
It was something I really appreciate, when my go-to multiplayer games, such as Warzone and Destiny 2, demand my constant and unwavering attention. Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals. Or, ya know, over Discord while everyone is surrounded by takeaway tubs in their bedrooms.

We’ll all be sporting Methuselah-length beards and have popped all the achievements in Starfield’s umpteenth DLC by then.

                              <span>V Rising, the vampiric survival base builder and surprise hit of 2022 so far, has just got freshly minted Steam Deck Playable status - courtesy of an update to the Deck’s Proton compatibility software. As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.


Technically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.

                              <span>First released in 1987 - back when Games Workshop were, arguably, much more fun than they are today - Rogue Trader was the first edition of what would eventually become tabletop miniature megachonker Warhammer 40,000. Rogue Traders, the stars of the setting, are themselves a touch more colourful than your average corpse-emperor enjoyer; freelance explorers given a ship, a packed lunch, and a cohort of space-toughs, and sent off to explore the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. And it’s this unique place in the 40k universe that makes them such an exciting prospect for the setting&#x27;s first fully-fledged classic CRPG.

VideoCardz spotted the press release for the small-scale launch, which confirms some of the A380 specs, its comfort zone of 1080p / 60fps on medium quality settings, and a recommended price: 1030 yuan. That’s about £130 / $150, not accounting for regional tax maths.

                              <span>How much should a 1440p 144Hz monitor cost, a good one, when it&#x27;s on sale? Normally the answer is around $300, but today Monoprice have gone one further. Their Zero-G 27-in 1440p 144Hz curved monitor has dropped from $250 to $190 - mere pocket change*! 
Exaggerations aside, this is a legitimately good price for a monitor of this spec, especially one that has actually attracted reasonable reviews in its category. It ticks a lot of boxes - great contrast, good colour accuracy, reasonable pixel density, a sturdy stand, four display inputs and FreeSync/G-Sync Compatible support. Not bad at all!

                              <span>The RTX 2060 isn&#x27;t the new hotness that it was a few years ago, but a global pandemic and chip shortage means that the card is still a surprisingly capable option three years later. The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you&#x27;re willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. 
That&#x27;s a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates.

That mostly involved middle aged men in jeans talking through their marketing bulletpoints, but there were also a couple of new announcements in between. One of them was that co-op survival-me-do Valheim is heading to PC Game Pass this autumn.

Called The Forgotten Saga, it has Eivor battling against waves of enemies in Niflheim, and try-die-repeating in order to attain unlocks which persist between runs. You&#x27;ll find a trailer for it below.

                              <span>It should be a rule that any game which shows a slick, edited trailer at E3 (or not-E3) has to then release a longer, more illustrative piece of footage, too. That way we&#x27;ll be able to take our dose of hype, then follow it with a dash of reality. 

So it is with Outpost, a first-person base-builder with seemingly massive swarms that impressed during the Future Games Show. How does it look in the 8 minutes of playtest footage below? Less impressive - but still compelling.

                              <span>A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a &quot;farmadventure&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. 
Developers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it&#x27;s very peaceful, and there&#x27;s no death (a &quot;survival game without survival&quot;). It&#x27;s all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere.

                              <span>Barbarian-tinged match-3 puzzler Grindstone is abandoning its exclusivity to the Epic Games Store and venturing into the untamed wilderness of Steam on June 20th, developers Capybara Games have revealed. All updates to the game that released on other platforms such as Apple Arcade and Nintendo Switch will be included. There’s a helpfully explanatory animated trailer to watch below.

                              <span>The collective JRPG fandom did a little squee and cartwheeled when Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Portable were announced for PC at Sunday’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase. There was no word on whether either game would make their way to Steam like Persona 4 Golden, though. Well, never fear, because developers Atlus say both games will be coming to Valve’s storefront, as Eurogamer report. In case you missed the trailer, here it is below.

                              <span>If you played Hypnospace Outlaw, there’s a high chance you’ll remember Zane “Zane_Rocks_14” Lofton. He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?


Ahem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.

With the defendants relying on a fair use defense, both sides are now asking the court to decide the case in their favor, without need for a full trial.

Shutdowns, raids, arrests, and site-blocking orders have repeatedly made headlines. Against this backdrop, it&#x27;s surprising to see that piracy has become more popular, with YouTube and Facebook now the top sources to access content illegally. Meanwhile, password sharing is a growing concern too.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!

                              <span>After an extended period of time, we&#x27;re finally ready to announce that the game Chewy: ESC From F5 is ready for testing. This quirky game features the protagonist Chewy as he tries to outwit the evil Borks. Escaping from their high security zone, F5, will just be the start of his adventure.
If any of you have the game and are willing to test it out, we&#x27;ll welcome any feedback. You will need a daily development build. As always, please submit the bug reports to our issue tracker. 
Please note that the ScummVM version does have one major outstanding issue: the music used by the game is in a custom format we&#x27;ve been unable to properly support yet. So only sound effects and speech currently work at this time.
