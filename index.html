Sheffield-based rock band Arctic Monkeys have released their seventh studio album The Car today. This may have been something playing on the radio (or however the younguns listen to their music nowadays) here at NL Towers, but it&#x27;s now on our radar for a totally different reason today — it apparently makes a reference to City Life on the Nintendo DS.
Freelance games writer Jordan Oloman spotted a breakdown of the song &#x27;Sculptures Of Anything Goes&#x27; on Genius (thanks GamesRadar!), where one avid listener has pointed out a potential video game reference in the song&#x27;s third verse.

                              <span>Enhancements abound.
We were charmed by TRAGsoft&#x27;s take on the monster-collecting genre, Coromon, when it launched this summer (after a short notice delay). For a look back at the old-school Pokémon-style, we found it was a lot of fun and gave it a healthy 7/10 in our review. Now, we&#x27;ve got a reason to go back, as the developer announced that a brand new update has dropped for the game.
It&#x27;s a beefy update too, and the first one for Switch, with the two major headlines being Trait Enhancement and the reduction of RNG. Trait Enhancements allow you to cancel your Coromon&#x27;s evolution or even devolve it to benefit from improved versions of their trait.

For many of us, this summer&#x27;s gaming was defined by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge - a title so enjoyable that we dubbed it &#x27;the best Turtles beat &#x27;em up ever made&#x27; in our glowing review. As Focus Entertainment has just released its financial report for the last quarter (thanks, Go Nintendo), we were interested to see what the turtles managed to bring in for the company, and it looks like they did well.
According to the report round-up in Game Developer, Focus Entertainment took time to praise Dotemu - one of its subsidiary branches and the publishers on Shredder&#x27;s Revenge - for its good performance with the game, announcing that the turtles had made €22.9 million (roughly $22 million) in the second quarter.

When Pilotwings 64 flew onto the Switch&#x27;s N64 library earlier this month, we were ready for an overall relaxing time. The improved frame rate and tighter Switch controls would be able to take this game that we were big fans of back on the N64 and only improve our playing experience further, right?
Wrong! While, for the most part, we remain big fans of the game and continue to have a good time with it, it looks like the Switch is playing havoc with some sections of the flying experience - notably in the game&#x27;s bonus &#x27;Birdman&#x27; level.

There was plenty of drama last weekend when the original voice of Bayonetta Hellena Taylor uploaded a series of videos on social media accusing developer PlatinumGames and Hideki Kamiya of an insulting wage offer.
This followed with a report by Bloomberg and separate anonymous sources claiming Taylor was originally offered more than previously mentioned. The new voice actor in Bayonetta 3 Jennifer Hale even chimed in - explaining how she couldn&#x27;t really say anything due to an NDA, but calling for peace on all sides.

Bayonetta 3 developer Platinum Games, the studio former Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor accused of low-balling with &quot;immoral&quot; compensation (which has since been disputed by Bloomberg reporting – see original story below), has responded to the ongoing voice actor controversy surrounding its game. The studio does not directly address any claims made by Taylor, instead opting to voice its support of new Bayonetta voice actor and Taylor&#x27;s replacement, Jennifer Hale.

                              <span>There&#x27;s My Nintendo Splatoon 3 Pokemon rewards involved
A Pokemon Splatfest is imminent, but until then, Japan is going all-out with their celebrations for the milestone event: which includes swag, and Pokemon center participation (as well as a few other locations listed below).
First up, Nintendo is offering keychains for Platinum Points (for My Nintendo Japan), including SKUs for each of the Splatfest choices: grass, fire, and water. They actually resemble the patterns of the t-shirts that will appear in-game, which is a nice touch.
A &quot;Collaboration Festival&quot; is also underway at Pokemon Centers &quot;nationwide&quot; (again, in Japan), where you can pick up tie-in stickers (featuring the key art for the event). Curiously, some centers also have &quot;polling stations,&quot; which include &quot;voting stickers&quot; for each choice.
As a reminder, everything will kick off on November 11 at 4PM PT, through November 13 at that same time. The Pokemon Center tie-ins begin on October 21, and will run through November 13 (or, as Nintendo points out, as long as supplies last).
Here&#x27;s a list of the Japanese locations hosting Pokemon Splatfest events:
Bic Camera Sapporo (Hokkaido)
Bic Camera Yurakucho (Tokyo)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Akiba (Tokyo)
Bic Camera Lazona Kawasaki (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Yokohama (Kanagawa)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Umeda (Osaka)
Yodobashi Camera Multimedia Hakata (Fukuoka)
&quot;All Pokemon Center stores&quot;
[Update: The US My Nintendo site has been updated, and confirms that the trio of keychains are &quot;coming soon&quot; to the US side.]

Nintendo revealed the next N64 classics that will be joining the Nintendo Switch Online archive of retrotastic releases — And it&#x27;s none other than colorful and incredibly nostalgic digital board games Mario Party and Mario Party 2. The two titles will be available to subscribers from November 2.
Developed by Hudson Soft and released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, Mario Party and Mario Party 2 were Nintendo&#x27;s hugely successful efforts to transpose the beloved Super Mario Bros. universe to a &quot;tabletop&quot; format, with players chasing each other around a digital board game, and battling it out in fun, short, silly, and simplistic mini-games.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;meP0WTgUJcE
Focusing on basic controls, easy-to-learn rules, and fast action, Mario Party can be seen as one of Nintendo&#x27;s earliest forays into the &quot;anyone can play&quot; demography. This inclusive view of the family gaming audience would lead to the development and staggering success of the Nintendo Wii platform.
Since those halcyon years, the franchise has continued on successive platforms including the Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, and, most recently, the Nintendo Switch in the form of 2021&#x27;s Mario Party Superstars. While the visuals and creativity have obviously progressed with each and every entry, the series has never lost sight of its inclusive nature, still offering pick-up-and-play fun for both dedicated video game fans, and visiting holiday relatives. With these Nintendo Switch Online re-releases, series fans who missed out on the franchise&#x27;s formative days can jump back into the action all over again.
Bagsy Peach.

                              <span>Which Witch?
PlatinumGames has finally broken its silence on the ugly Bayonetta 3 voice actor controversy that has been the height of internet discourse for the past week — In a new statement posted to Twitter, the studio reaffirmed its solidarity with actor Jennifer Hale, who will portray the gunslinging witch in the new sequel, which hits the shelves next week after years of anticipation.
The incredibly straight statement, presented unemotionally and sparsely worded as if it has been passed through several legal departments, outlines Platinum&#x27;s desire to continue forward with Hale as the &quot;new Bayonetta&quot;, while thanking all those who have contributed to the franchise&#x27;s past success, (though choosing not to reference anybody in particular by name.)

                              <span>About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

It&#x27;s been a wild ride since the day Niero randomly took a chance on me, and I&#x27;m proud of what the team has accomplished, and will accomplish.
Deep down, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be here &quot;forever&quot; — but I also knew that I wouldn&#x27;t really want to do this job anywhere else. I didn&#x27;t just want to write about games; I wanted to write about games on Destructoid. On the internet, there&#x27;s no shortage of places to call home. This one&#x27;s been mine for a long time, and it has become an unshakable part of my identity.
Every year at Destructoid has been diffe…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s on My Nintendo now
A new Nintendo Halloween wallpaper just dropped via the My Nintendo program, and it&#x27;s amazingly cute, especially when it comes to the takes on certain characters.
Not unlike a Disney promo with Mickey masquerading as Count Dracula, Mario takes on a Pumpkin-Vampire-like form, with Peach as a witch, Luigi as a werewolf, Yoshi as a dragon, and Toad as a ghost. A few enemies even make it in too, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the mummy Blooper: give me that toy. The wallpaper is zero Platinum Points and fully digital.
Beyond that, Nintendo also has a &quot;spooky pumpkin-carving stencil&quot; for Splatoon 3, and reminds folks that they have a host of physical rewards currently up on My Nintendo. At the time of writing, newer restocks include the Metroid Dread poster set, as well as a Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope keychain.
As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.

                              <span>Can your PC run it yet?
Crytek has announced that its visually stunning shooter compendium Crysis Remastered Trilogy will be arriving on PC via the Steam platform on November 17 — The sci-fi revisit was previously made available to Epic Games Store in the fall of 2021, but is now close to surpassing its exclusivity deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;N45pDqpfm8g
As one would naturally expect, Crysis Remastered Trilogy contains remasters of the three highly-explosive adventures in the Crysis franchise. Odd, that. Famously resource-hungry upon their initial PC release, the titles are well known for their dynamic action, dazzling visuals, and groundbreaking special effects. Of course, this trinity of remasters only serves to add further polish to all three games, with improved lighting and weather effects, high-resolution textures, and visual enhancements to the in-game models.
If you never got around to experiencing this exciting series of actioners, (perhaps your 486 DX 2 wasn&#x27;t up to the task), then this release could prove the perfect opportunity to check them out. Steam will be launching the trilogy at a discounted price for the first week of release, with a pretty chunky 40% off of the asking price. In addition, players who already own the original Crysis Remastered on Steam will earn further discount, allowing them to round out the collection for not too many dollarydoos.
Crysis Remastered Trilogy launches on Steam November 17. It is available right now on PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Epic Games Store.

                              <span>My asterisk is probably common
Zelda: Breath of the Wild has given tons of people hundreds hours of stuff to do, but is there anything on your list you haven&#x27;t checked off yet?
This question was spurred on by this reddit post by Wickerchair, who mused on playing &quot;400+ hours&quot; of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and still coming across a &quot;???&quot; unidentified item. Another really interesting story comes from Grancola1920, who mentioned in the comments that they &quot;recently ran into a bug with &#x27;???&#x27; after 700+ hours and it flew away before [they] could catch it. Now [they&#x27;re] on a Hyrule wide bug hunt.&quot; It&#x27;s amazing that stories like these can still come out of this game, even if a lot of folks have moved on.
But what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?
For me, it&#x27;s the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds
I know! I 100%ed the game otherwise (all items that I know of/shrines): everything except the Korok Seeds. I was going to do it (and made good progress before guides were invented!), but once I saw the reward, I just couldn&#x27;t go through with it.
Growing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was &quot;worthy&quot; of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That&#x27;s enough for me.
But 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward? That&#x27;s where I check out!

                              <span>Take the writer&#x27;s eerie tale on the go
Just in time for the scary season, Alan Wake gets a new portable form. Alan Wake Remastered is out today, October 20, for the Nintendo Switch.
The listing is currently live on the eShop and going for $29.99, with a launch discount bringing it down to $23.99 right now.
Nintendo Switch&#x27;s version of the remaster contains all the content, including the base game and both The Signal and The Writer story expansions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PORiCbyWAM4
Notably, it runs on the Nintendo Switch too. Unlike some other modern games that have made their way to Nintendo&#x27;s handheld recently, Alan Wake Remastered is not a cloud app, but seems to run right off the Switch hardware.
The writer will go portable
It&#x27;s an impressive feat, and makes me a bit interested to see how the remaster holds up on Switch. Alan Wake Remastered was no visual slouch when it first released for other platforms.
That said, developers have been working some real technical magic with the Nintendo Switch lately. Just look at ports like NieR: Automata&#x27;s Switch version. As the years have gone on, it&#x27;s impressive what some have accomplished.
We&#x27;ll see if Alan Wake Remastered also stands up as a port, but as a game, it&#x27;s certainly held its following. Heck, it&#x27;s well-liked enough to even be tied into Remedy&#x27;s Control, and get a sequel greenlit for development.
This story of a writer fighting the dark with a flashlight seems to still hold sway. And if you&#x27;re curious about it and want something eerie to dig into on the go, Alan Wake Remastered is now available for that on the Nintendo Switch.

Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, the new Ubisoft developed and Nintendo-partnered adventure, is the highlight this week. New Tales from the Borderlands and Jackbox Party Pack 9 are also newer releases that are coming out day and date with other platforms.
Persona 5 Royal also deserves its own spotlight, since it&#x27;s arriving on Switch with all the bells and whistles that the Royal edition comes with. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden will hit in January, if you were curious about those!

And, in addition this long overdue feature in smash-selling franchise, EA Sports has also announced its intention to invest in women&#x27;s football via a series of new initiatives.
Firstly, EA will contribute $11 million USD via its &quot;Starting XI&quot; fund, which will be invested in women&#x27;s clubs, leagues, and up-and-coming players. This will be followed in 2023 by a new internship program, which will be extended to all of its women&#x27;s footballing partners in order to help support and finance new and upcoming players as they begin their journey to glory within The Beautiful Game.

                              <span>It&#x27;s right there on their official YouTube channel
The full top 30 billboard for Persona 5 Royal tracks is in, thanks to a new event from Atlus on their YouTube account (presented by &quot;DJ Morgana&quot; on behalf of the development studio). As a reminder, Atlus is using the opportunity to push one of their most successful games of all time again, given the recent re-release on multiple platforms.
Over on the official Atlus YouTube channel, the publisher has been slowly revealing the top-voted Persona 5 Royal music tracks over the course of several weeks. But today, we finally got the number one pick: Life Will Change. Let&#x27;s take a look at how the rest of the top five shook out!
The top five Persona 5 Royal tracks from Atlus:
Life Will Change
I Believe
Rivers in the Desert
Take Over
Last Surprise
The most incredible thing about this is that there are so many choices for top Persona 5 Royal tracks. Like, literally just one game: as so many other franchises would kill to have a top thirty of beloved tracks total. My only gripe is that Beneath the Mask clocks in at number 13 (it should be higher!). Other than that, it looks mostly fine. It was a good opportunity to basically queue up the entire soundtrack and listen to it all over again.
Life Will Change is the top pick
It&#x27;s not a surprise win, but &quot;Life Will Change&quot; is the number one pick. You can listen to it, with the winning declaration, below.

                              <span>We get a better look at the warring factions fueling this Final Fantasy
A new Final Fantasy XVI trailer dropped today, showing off more of the upcoming RPG&#x27;s massive Eikon battles and the world they take place in.
Final Fantasy XVI is set in the dying world of Valisthea. Life clings to the remaining crystals of a fading planet, as parts of it wither to dust.
Predictably, different groups and ideologies have sprung up around these major crystals, and their introduction serves as the first chunk of today&#x27;s lengthy 4-and-a-half minute trailer.

Ranging from the ambitious and imperial to the very much cult-like, there&#x27;s a good variety. Rosaria is the bastion of tradition, while others like the Kingdom of Waloed prefer their isolation.

Alongside the slew of new and old video games announced during yesterday&#x27;s Silent Hill Transmission live stream, Konami also revealed the existence of a brand new movie, Return to Silent Hill.
The live-action horror title will be directed by Christophe Gans, who was behind the lens for the original 2006 Silent Hill film adaptation — considered by many to be one of the better game-to-movie adaptations. Speaking in a short promo reel, which you can check out below, Gans revealed that the new film will be based upon the plot of 2001 game Silent Hill 2 — which is itself a fan favorite among the franchise&#x27;s dedicated community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;j_FOVN-UkEI
&quot;This return is my return to a world, a universe I touched in 2006... 15 years ago,&quot; recalls Gans in the clip. &quot;The film was a great success and we decided to go back to the best of these stories.... Silent Hill 2. The film tells the story of a young guy coming back to Silent Hill, where he has known a great love [but] what he&#x27;s going to find is a pure nightmare.&quot;
Konami also took the opportunity to officially announce a remake of Silent Hill 2 itself, which will be headed up by the horror gaming heads of Bloober Team. In fact, it was also suggested that Return to Silent Hill is something of a catalyst for the various incoming gaming efforts, with Konami hoping that the new film will inspire players to dive back into the digital fog of the cursed town.
Return to Silent Hill will begin shooting in early 2023.

                              <span>A New Generation, How to Reveal a Fallout Live, and The Great Green Debate
In case you missed it, Bethesda is running a Fallout retrospective series on their official YouTube channel, and more episodes just dropped. Beyond the inaugural clip that reminded us where Fallout came from, we&#x27;re immediately moving into the Bethesda era.
You can watch the first episode here, but we&#x27;ll go over the gist of the additional episodes that dropped this week below.
Fallout Retrospective: A New Generation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8APJIukXySU
In A New Generation, the team talks about showing off Fallout 3 to Tim Cain, a creator of the franchise: and how Bethesda was able to move into the &quot;next generation&quot; of Fallout
Fallout Retrospective: How to Reveal a Fallout Live
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JSePOZU2WsQ
As we move into the more polarizing parts of the series&#x27; history, this video features Todd Howard, and his role in presenting Fallout games to the world (and how he had the idea to do one giant presentation instead of multiple ones per game). We also get some talk about the pressure to succeed from Fallout 3 to Fallout 4.
No matter how some of these entries turn out, you can&#x27;t really deny that Bethesda is one of the best in the business in terms of promising early gameplay.
Fallout Retrospective: The Great Green Debate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_vnznzZFd_g
In one of the more interesting videos so far, Bethesda defends its &quot;green color palette&quot; in games, and talks about the &quot;right&quot; colors for the series. The team recounts &quot;endless discussions about the color green.&quot;
The main point they hit is the need to really get it right for the Pip Boy UI, as the player is going to be looking at it constantly over the course of the game.

Sushi’s delicious, it’s just too bad we love it so much that it’s driving the depletion of ocean habitats. However, that’s largely because the industry relies on non-selective fishing. Spearfishing might not get us the quantity we crave, but it’s much more sustainable. So good on Dave the Diver for being environmentally conscious.
The marriage of spearfishing and restaurant management is a tantalizing mix I didn’t know I wanted. Now I just have to deal with the constant cravings.

                              <span>Mysterious community-focused RPG
During yesterday&#x27;s veritable banquet of Silent Hill news and reveals, Konami teased a mysterious new project that will see developers and fans party together to develop, alter, and shape the outcome of a story set within the traumatic, fog-filled town and its wider canon universe at large.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5rflWSj_o3o&amp;t
Coming across as something of a modern take on the Alternate Reality games of yore, Silent Hill: Ascension will task its users will following an original storyline and making choices and decisions that will be reflected in the movements, actions, and fates of its characters. As such, it is hoped that the community will be able to feel a part of a living and evolving Silent Hill storyline, responsible for shaping its protagonists and leading them to glory... or... well...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JgwqxUnj8_4
This ambitious project is the child of a party of well-known gaming and media studios, including Genvid, Bad Robot, Dj2 Entertainment, and Behavior Interactive — the horror aficionados behind the popular asymmetrical title Dead by Daylight. While details are a little sketchy at this early stage, Silent Hill: Ascension is certainly an intriguing prospect, looking to blend the themes of the popular survival horror series with the gameplay of a tabletop role-playing game and presented on modern streaming media.
Should this ambitious experiment prove successful, it is very easy for one to imagine other publishers embarking on similar projects with their own horror and adventure IPs.
Silent Hill: Ascension is currently in development with an estimated 2023 launch window.

Splatoon 3 amiibo pre-orders are beginning to roll out this week, as Best Buy and Target have kicked off sales.
The thing is: Best Buy is constantly running out of Splatoon 3 amiibo pre-orders minutes after restocks: while Target still has all three in stock in the second run. You&#x27;re looking for Splatoon Inkling (Yellow), Octoling (Blue), and Smallfry. The packaging for the new Splatoon 3 run includes black, blue, and yellow coloring. Amiibo News is reporting that they could go in stock at Amazon imminently.
Currently, the release date is still officially November 11. All three will arrive on that date, and will provide costume bonuses, like other key amiibo released so far for the series. You&#x27;ll also be able to take pictures with the figures for your own enjoyment. So you&#x27;re not missing a ton by forgoing this round of figurines: which is par for the course for a lot of amiibo releases these past few years. That said, I fully expect the new idol trio will be on sale at some point.
Once these three are released in November, we’ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Wave 11 (2022-2023):
Sephiroth
Pyra/Mythra
Kazuya
Sora (still needs full confirmation)
As always, you can check out when those were released here in our master amiibo list, which has been updated since 2014.

                              <span>Dante&#x27;s Peak
Capcom&#x27;s ultra-stylish and superbly silly hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash title Devil May Cry 5 has smashed past six million sales — The publisher proudly announced that the flashy sequel hit the impressive milestone this month, with the number tabulated from global sales on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
Devil May Cry 5, which initially launched on PS4, PC, and Xbox One in 2019, was something of a grand comeback for the Gothic Disco series, pulling the franchise away from its closely-held and somewhat cult following and making a splash as a major, mainstream release. In much the same way that Monster Hunter World reminded video game fans at large what Monster World was, DmC5 reintroduced, (and in some cases, introduced), Dante and his sexy pals to a new audience of players on a global basis.
In fact, some would argue that DmC5 was one of the key titles that kicked off Capcom&#x27;s latter-day renaissance, which has seen the legendary developer go from strength to strength with smash releases such as Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Rise, Resident Evil: Village, the Resident Evil remakes, Capcom Arcade Stadium, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6. In the fall of 2020, Capcom would release DmC5 for then-new platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, in the form of Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition.
Devil May Cry 5 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t want to have to do this, but they gave me no choice
I was really excited to get to do the New Tales from the Borderlands review for Destructoid. Telltale’s Tales from the Borderlands is an all-time favorite of mine that I’ve played through multiple times, and while I was disappointed to see that Gearbox’s take on Tales wouldn’t continue Rhys, Fiona, and Sasha’s story, I was optimistic that the sequel would be an enjoyable experience. How wrong I was.
As I made my way through each subsequent episode, I regretted taking on this review more and more. Now I’m tasked with detailing what a torturous experience this was, and to be the bearer of bad news. And likely incur some wrath from those who want to defend this hot mess.
I honestly don’t even know where to start.

                              <span>A surprise drop for a surprising follow-up
NEO: The World Ends With You hits a new platform today. Square Enix surprise-dropped The World Ends With You&#x27;s follow-up on Steam today, October 19.
Originally released in 2021, NEO: The World Ends With You first hit PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It later arrived on PC, though only through the Epic Games Store.
This Steam release brings the pin-slamming action onto Steam&#x27;s platform, for anyone who wants it specifically on that storefront. It&#x27;s going for $59.99, though as of this writing it has a 25% launch discount running until October 25.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YvZquGt-XDA
Picking this version up will net you the Legendary Threads and Reapers&#x27; Game Survival sets, for a little boost right out of the gate.
Nothing on the NEO: The World Ends With You Steam page indicates its Steam Deck status yet. It does have full controller support though, so that&#x27;s at least an indicator that it&#x27;s worth testing out.
A new world
NEO is the follow-up to The World Ends With You, a Nintendo DS game that launched in 2007 in Japan and 2008 abroad. The original has since seen several ports and been hailed as one of the DS&#x27; better games.
With NEO, Square Enix and h.a.n.d. took on a new tale (with some eventual tie-ins to the old, of course) and it came out alright. Its novel approach to the combat was interesting; new systems often had trouble mimicking the dual-screen battles that made The World Ends With You so unique,  so NEO went for a different approach that still tried to capture that puck-passing, pin-slamming combat.
Even though NEO has some stiff competition this month for RPGs to play on Steam, it&#x27;s still worth a look if you&#x27;ve ever been curious. It&#x27;s a stylish, more modern RPG that uses its death game setting pretty well, with an absolutely stellar soundtrack.
NEO: The World Ends With You is available on Steam for PC here.

                              <span>A Silent Hill game written by Umineko author Ryukishi07
A brand-new Silent Hill game is on the way from an interesting set of collaborators. Today, Konami revealed Silent Hill f, a forthcoming game set in 1960&#x27;s Japan.
This &quot;beautiful yet horrifying&quot; world has an intriguing lineup of developers. Neobards Entertainment is developing, alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and creature and character design by kera.
Ryukishi07, the pen name behind stories like Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry, is writing Silent Hill f. His stories often have a good mix of both horror and mystery to them, which seem like a great fit for Silent Hill. And the trailer already makes a fantastic first impression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;rPNXE_q4BdE
No more info was shared today, either on platforms or release timing. Also no indication what the &quot;f&quot; stands for. It&#x27;s styled a bit like a musical forte, maybe?
Heading back to Silent Hill
This new game wasn&#x27;t the only bit of Silent Hill news today. Konami also unveiled a Silent Hill 2 remake, in collaboration with The Medium studio Bloober Team.
Its third-party expansion doesn&#x27;t just include Silent Hill f, either. NoCode, which made Stories Untold and Observation, is working on its own Silent Hill project, subtitled Townfall.
And Bad Robot is teaming with Genvid and a host of others for Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive experience that revolves around Silent Hill. We didn&#x27;t get too much of an idea what that looks like, but the trailer definitely had a weird, live-stream horror vibe.
With all that, plus a new movie on the way, there is a surprising amount of Silent Hill suddenly on its way. You can watch the full livestream showcase and all the Silent Hill announcements here.

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more.

With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting.

                              <span>Football Manager 2023&#x27;s early access beta is live now. As per usual, pre-ordering the latest iteration of the long-running management sim gives you access to the beta, which is nearly-final version of the full game. It&#x27;s 20% cheaper than the full game will be when it releases on November 8th, and it&#x27;s available from Steam and the Epic Game Store.

                              <span>A while back I wrote about Codenames, an excellent board game with a free browser-based version that made for some great long-distance family time during lockdown. Now, dear reader, I return once again with a free browser-based game that&#x27;s perfect for long-distance fun. But this time, it&#x27;s just about the funniest game I can remember playing. It&#x27;s called Gartic Phone.

                              <span>Square Enix have released a new cinematic (with a teeny sliver of gameplay) trailer for Final Fantasy 16 today, and crikey, there&#x27;s a heck of a lot of summons action in there. Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix&#x27;s long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you&#x27;ll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let&#x27;s take a look, shall we?

                              <span>It’s that time of week again, as the Epic Games Store rotates its free games and grants us two fresh things to play for nowt. If we don’t own them already, that is. There’s a strong chance that you might have already picked up either or both of this week’s freebies. One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.

                              <span>As a James who’s always forgetting things, I’m probably the main target audience of the Silent Hill 2 remake – one of yesterday’s many Silent Hill game and film announcements. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.


Highlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.

In an update on the Overwatch forums, Blizzard confirmed that the missing characters should be returning to the game on October 25th, alongside the Junkertown map, which has also recently been disabled due to graphical performance bugs. Their return coincides with the game’s next planned update.

There are chips in this family with many more cores and even higher clock speeds, like the £700 Core i9-13900K, but this is the one most upgrade-seekers will probably look to first: a mid-range champion to take over from the Core i5-12600K.

                              <span>Valve have updated their Steamworks documentation for developers with a commitment to refresh their suggestions for regional pricing more often. This change in frequency is an effort to reflect global and local economic conditions affecting regions. While the company reminds developers that they are free to set their own prices in different regions, Steam provides regional pricing suggestions based on the price of a game in US dollars. Those recommendations should be updated more regularly, Valve said.

                              <span>I watched a badminton match where one player was so dominant, his opponent looked like he&#x27;d largely given up. The commentator said, &quot;Yep, the belief has all but vanished&quot;, as it panned over a guy who simply wanted to be anywhere but that court. At the time, I&#x27;d already sunk some hours into Gotham Knights and taken a quick break from the action to keep tabs on a tournament and collect my thoughts. But as I turned away from the telly to dive back in for another session, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that if the same commentator had been in the room with me too, they would&#x27;ve repeated themselves. I&#x27;d simply had enough.

                              <span>In every story where a wish is granted - whether by some primary-coloured goon sticking out a lamp, a creepy piece of fairground entertainment, or a piece of cursed bushmeat - there&#x27;s always an ironical sting in the tale. You wish for health and it turns out you can&#x27;t die. You wish for a personal chef, but it turns out he only does offal. You wish everything you touch to turn to gold, then it&#x27;ll turn out there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - or it kicks in just as you go to the toilet, that kind of thing. You should, as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.
I&#x27;m sorry I wished for New Tales From the Borderlands, everyone.

                              <span>As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We&#x27;re all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It&#x27;s very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I&#x27;m sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We&#x27;re still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I&#x27;d imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted as soon as we&#x27;ve got more to share on it.
Things that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year&#x27;s list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won&#x27;t want to miss it.

                              <span>The piracy liability trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande Communications is underway. When the parties presented their opening statements, Grande informed the jury that it will present a witness who has spoken to multiple innocent infringers. That came as a surprise to the labels and prompted a request for the court to exclude &#x27;hearsay&#x27; evidence from the jury.

But, of all of them, Mario Party may have spawned a few too many arguments that have spawned an amusing life-long legacy of familial rivalries and blistered hands.

Well, we&#x27;re counting on you lovely lot for that. No, we don&#x27;t want any bickering — it&#x27;s our (your) job to give the stars out, not win them this time around. We asked you to rank every single Mario Party game that you&#x27;ve played, and below, you&#x27;ll be able to find out which one is the prime party candidate, and what should be left in their gift wrap and returned.

Today we have learned not only that the game is set to come out on 3rd November, 2022, but also what changes have been made in porting the release to Switch.

Publisher and developer Atooi is doing something pretty interesting with its upcoming party title, Run Box Run.
Launching on the Switch on 3rd November, the online multiplayer game is a cute escape room title with trivia intermissions for up to 13 players. In a bold move to get that multiplayer base up and running rapidly, the makers have decided to offer a 100% &quot;owner&#x27;s discount&quot; for players who already own an Atooi-published game on Nintendo Switch.

The weekly Famitsu Japanese charts show little signs of change this week, particularly up the top. For the first time since its release, Splatoon 3 has dipped below 100k sales, selling just (big air quotes here) 97,071 units in the week of 10th to 16th October.
NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition has remained steady, dropping down just one place, though slipping under 10k units sold. The only other game to sell more than 10k, and barely, is Dragon Quest X Offline on Switch.

Designed to be whacked onto the bottom of the GameCube itself, the Game Boy Player does exactly what it says on the tin: it lets you play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games right on your television set. It was quite remarkable at the time, and serves as one of the primary reasons many Nintendo gamers still dig out their GameCubes to this very day.

Today&#x27;s video focuses on how Sakurai came up with the original Super Smash Bros. — you know, that tiny little Nintendo crossover beat &#x27;em up that has ballooned into one of Nintendo&#x27;s most successful games?
But in this video, Sakurai has not only delved into the original concepts and ideas behind his first fighting game but he&#x27;s shared footage from a never-before-seen game that served as the prototype for Smash Bros. — Dragon King: The Fighting Game.

                              <span>Released seven years ago, Warhammer 40,000: Regicide offers a kind of far future murder-chess. Although really that should be &quot;offered&quot;. Earlier today, Regicide&#x27;s developers announced on Steam that the game had been taken off sale and its servers closed down. In the brief announcement, developers Hammerfall Publishing say only that they &quot;will be venturing into new and exciting projects in the future.&quot;

                              <span>The Crysis Remastered Trilogy is heading to Steam next month, a little over a year after it first launched via the Epic Games Store. The pack does what you&#x27;d expect it to: takes Crytek&#x27;s three scifi shooters and spruces them up with modern rendering trickery.

If it isn’t, it’s not too hard to pretend, and DRG’s another-day-at-the-office wit lends it a likeable levity that’s partly why I’ve played it almost every week for a year and a half.

                              <span>The last time we saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune in A Plague Tale: Innocence, the two homeless orphans were escaping the clutches of the Inquisition, trying desperately to find a cure for the cursed Prima Macula in Hugo’s blood. They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?
Turns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they&#x27;ll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.

Earlier this week, the publisher announced there would be a Silent Hill Transmission stream taking place today, October 19th, which would provide &quot;the latest updates&quot; on the series. At the time, there were no streaming links available, but in setting their YouTube page live this morning, Konami jumped the gun and included some of the game names being revealed. And it&#x27;s the big one, folks. Spoilers within, obvs.

                              <span>Get hype for some brand new Silent Hill content
It&#x27;s been ten years since Silent Hill fans have gotten any new content, but thanks to Konami&#x27;s stream today that&#x27;s focused on showcasing the future of the series, we have a ton to look forward to now. One of the exciting upcoming titles previewed during the stream is a new spin-off title made by Annapurna and award-winning studio No Code called Silent Hill: Townfall.
The teaser trailer opens with a mysterious voice on some kind of tape recorder that also features a screen showing some creepy images, as is the way of horror games. Unfortunately the trailer doesn&#x27;t give us much info as to what the gameplay or story might look like, but tonally, it seems like it&#x27;ll fit right in with the rest of the Silent Hill series.
https://youtu.be/oRvRWBQNrSI?t&#x3D;1329
No Code creative director Jon McKellan then appeared to give fans a little more insight into what to expect from the game. He describes how playing the original Silent Hill game in 1999 made him a lifelong fan, and how that title has influenced the types of games his studio has created in their previous releases, Observation and Stories Untold.
&quot;It&#x27;s a real honor for us to bring a new title to this series that both respects the source material, but also does something a little different with it,&quot; McKellan said. &quot;At No Code, we&#x27;re all about weaving that [psychological horror] narrative and that experience into every aspect of our game design, our audio, our visuals, even our UI.&quot;
The studio doesn&#x27;t have any more to share as of now, but it&#x27;s exciting to just know that this game is happening at all. Given No Code&#x27;s track record, especially with them working with Annapurna, I have some pretty high hopes that Silent Hill: Townfall will deliver both a terrifying and narratively fulfilling entry in the series.

                              <span>The remake will be a timed PS5 console exclusive
Today&#x27;s Silent Hill Transmission showcase started out with some big news. Silent Hill 2 is being remade by horror game studio Bloober Team.
The remake is being made for PlayStation 5 and PC, and will be a timed console exclusive for PlayStation for 12 months, according to today&#x27;s trailer.
In the trailer, you can see many scenes from the original game, remade by Bloober in collaboration with Konami.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8qPdInnvMzg
Bloober is working with original creature designer Masahiro Ito and composer Akira Yamaoka on the project.
What&#x27;s old, what&#x27;s new
While it&#x27;s retaining a similar vibe and working with the original creators, Bloober is also trying to make a strong impression, the same as the original had on PS2.
&quot;While we want to achieve the same end result, players expectations evolve over time, and certain things need to be modernized to have the same or similar effect,&quot; said creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart.

One change Bloober highlights is moving the camera to over-the-shoulder. The team is also doing some new motion capture, as shown in today&#x27;s showcase.
Konami and Bloober haven&#x27;t locked a release date or window yet for the Silent Hill 2 remake.

Amid investigations over Microsoft&#x27;s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here&#x27;s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
&quot;The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision…</span>

So, we&#x27;re getting a new Street Fighter, and we&#x27;re getting a new Tekken — Time to complete the unholy trinity, right? Well, here you go, a brand new Mortal Kombat! (mobile game). Currently in development at NetherRealm Studios, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will launch on iOS and Android in 2023.
This brand new RPG, set within the hyper-violent world of MK, will allow players to build up a team of their favorite kombatants, and embark upon a brand new, original storyline — a first for MK&#x27;s mobile gaming releases. Described as a collection (or &quot;kollection&quot;?) RPG, it sounds like Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will feature an abundance of goodies to gather, or likely — being a WB Games joint — buy.
&quot;We are pushing the boundaries of Mortal Kombat to allow players to experience the franchise in new ways, while still staying true to its core visceral nature,&quot; said Ed Boon, Chief Creative Officer of NetherRealm Studios. “With Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, we reimagined Mortal Kombat into a strategic team-based collection RPG with fast-paced, group melee combat that both new and existing fans can enjoy.&quot;
NRS did not release any trailer or screens from the new project, aside from some key splash art depicting MK legends such as Raiden, Baraka, Jade, and, of course, Sub-Zero and Scorpion, battling it out in the plains of Outworld. I&#x27;m sure that NetherRealm and WB Games will be sure to ply us with more details and information as development continues.
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will launch on iOS and Android platforms in 2023. Interested Outworlders can sign up for more info over at the official website.

While I will be the first to admit I&#x27;m totally garbo at racing games, I can&#x27;t help but be bewitched at the rollout of trailers for upcoming Electronic Arts release Need for Speed Unbound — Case in point: This dazzling new preview, which spotlights our street racers in the midst of a little tête-à-tête with The Law.
The &quot;Risk &amp; Reward&quot; trailer spotlights the dangerous with highly effective driving abilities that will help our night riders outrun Five-Oh, out in force and ready to put an end to their nefarious nocturnal activities. Hazardous high-speed drifts, bone-rattling handbrake turns, and a dose of the old nitrous oxide are all tools that will help the savvy racer put distance between themselves and a jail cell — at the ultimate risk of a brutal, wall-shattering smash and the loss of more than just First Place.

And in the midst of this Most Wanted-style chicanery, Criterion Games&#x27; latest road-ripper absolute stuns with its beautiful visuals, impactful colors, unique marriage of typical CG visuals and traditional animation, and immersive lighting, shadow, and weather effects, all gunning at silky smooth frame rates. By choosing to gun for current-gen platforms only, Need for Speed Unbound is clearly aiming to wow its fanbase with its speed, polish, and bespoke visual style... Goddamn, this is a good-looking video game.
Need for Speed Unbound launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.

Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company…</span>

Striking Distance Studios is confirming that yes, it still plans to release The Callisto Protocol on December 2. And when The Callisto Protocol arrives, it will have a 60 FPS performance mode option.
The survival-horror game was recently displayed with a February 12 date on the Epic Games Store, as reported by TheGamer. However, in a new tweet, Striking Distance confirms it&#x27;s still on track for December 2.
In the same tweet, the dev confirms that The Callisto Protocol will ship with a 60 FPS performance mode.
https://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1582510201898299392
For the release date mix-up, my unfounded, speculative guess is there was a 12/2 - 2/12 mix-up. Dates are silly.
However, the performance mode note is an interesting addition.

Surviving at 60 frames per second
WB Games Montreal made some news when a developer confirmed on Discord that Gotham Knights&#x27; console iterations would not have a performance mode. There will only be 30 FPS options for the new Bat-family beat &#x27;em up.
Gotham Knights moved from being a cross-gen launch to only releasing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PC players, meanwhile, will be able to get 60 FPS out of the brawler if their rig can handle it.
Whether this was an intentional jab or just a confirmation, it&#x27;s still at least good news for folks who like lots of frames in their horror games.
The Callisto Protocol is the debut game from Striking Distance Studios, founded by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield. While once set within the PUBG universe, the world is now its own and its looking to tell a pretty scary, visceral survival horror story.
I&#x27;d have to imagine those brutal fights with space terrors will probably look nice running at 60 FPS. The Callisto Protocol is set for December 2, 2022.

Arguably the biggest news from the presentation is that Bloober Team, the developer behind The Medium and other horror games, is remaking Silent Hill 2. The trailer for the game showed scenes from the iconic game with all-new visuals. The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming to PC via Steam and will be a PlayStation 5 console exclusive for at least a year after launch.

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of rumors, leaks, and speculation regarding the future of Silent Hill, Konami is finally revealing what’s next for the long-dormant franchise. The publisher is airing a special presentation that promises new Silent Hill reveals today at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. Could it be the much-rumored Silent Hill 2 remake by Bloober Team? Confirmation of the seemingly leaked Silent Hill: The Short Message? Whatever it winds up being, come and watch the event along with us!
Editors Marcus Stewart and the freshly returned Kyle Hilliard will be streaming and reacting to the Silent Hill transmission on Twitch beginning about 10-15 mins before the festivities begin (roughly 3:30 p.m. Central/4:30 p.m Eastern). Come hang with them along with the rest of the GI community and share excitement (or disappointment) at what Konami has in store. Missed the stream? Watch the YouTube version below!

                              <span>It&#x27;s the middle of the month, which means it&#x27;s time for another batch of Game Pass games to be detailed. For a start, today sees the day one release of A Plague Tale: Requiem, the followup to everyone&#x27;s favourite Middle Ages ratventure. There are similarly big games to come before the end of the month, however, including Persona 5 Royal.

                              <span>I used to think Ghostbusters was a fantasy about having a cool car and a slidey pole in your house. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York. But I suppose it&#x27;s also about bustin&#x27; ghosts, which is what Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed&#x27;s asymmetric multiplayer replicates. It&#x27;s out today.

                              <span>The Sims 4 is now a free-to-play game - and yet somehow this isn&#x27;t today&#x27;s biggest The Sims news. That&#x27;s because, during today&#x27;s Sims Summit livestream, Maxis also announced that the next The Sims is in-development. Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

                              <span>Robot damage hero Bastion has been unplayable in Overwatch 2 for the past week due to some unfortunate shenanigans with his artillery ultimate. It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

                              <span>Collectible card game Marvel Snap has been released into early access on Steam as a free to play download. Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

                              <span>I loved Overwatch when it first came out. When the original game was fresh and new, I was experimenting with the characters just like everyone else. I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

                              <span>A few more classics have made their way onto EA’s list of games they’re shutting down online services for, with Mirror’s Edge the most notable casualty for PC players. The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

I first reported on this free pumpkin carving game from Adamgryu (of A Short Hike fame) way back in 2020, when it was only the 999th festival, and Alice0 took a stroll around it last year, too.
This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

                              <span>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing
Carrying case

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

An MPA investigation to identify the site&#x27;s operator was met with sophisticated countermeasures. It ended at a UK property that has been publicly linked to other crimes worth billions of dollars. And a site called KickassTorrents.

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc discusses Persona 5 Royal, the hugely successful Atlus-developed RPG originally released in 2019 as a new version of the original 2016 Persona 5. After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we&#x27;ve been playing it. 
In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game&#x27;s opening moments (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven&#x27;t played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 Royal review.

And it is what you will have guessed upon reading that too. And yet, I enjoyed my ten minutes binning rubbish and mopping up stains (just stains, don&#x27;t worry about it). Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

                              <span>Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s all about pacing. Persona 5&#x27;s blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There&#x27;s a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65&quot; 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn&#x27;t enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn&#x27;t for me. At this point, I&#x27;d invested £100 into my &quot;Do I like Persona 5?&quot; experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm &quot;No, mate, you don&#x27;t&quot;. So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I&#x27;d play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

                              <span>I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I&#x27;ve been afraid to make my return. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be itching to delve back into what&#x27;s essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves&#x27; adventure, and yet it&#x27;s precisely because it blew me away the first time that I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it&#x27;s wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it&#x27;s the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm. Gi-give, no - give it here!

                              <span>The Steam Deck might be able to play modern AAA games on the go, but you should really crack out some classics of yesteryear from time to time too. It’s fun to see that there’s now a way to play old Game Boy Advance cartridges on Valve’s handheld, and they actually make the games look pretty sweet to boot. No, this isn&#x27;t Valve following up their Switch emulator gaffe. Wave hello to the GB Operator.

The friendly cow-turtle-dog-thing won the vote held to decide Minecraft’s new mob, held for 24 hours between Friday and the start of Minecraft Live on Saturday. Sniffer topped the poll with more than half of the 3.5 million votes cast. You can watch the result being announced in the video below.

No details have been shared about whether you’ll be able to tune in on YouTube or Twitch for the stream, but Konami shared a link to a page on their site so you should be able to watch it there.

                              <span>In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an &quot;unlaunch&quot; of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right&quot;, reads Nvidia’s statement. &quot;Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the &quot;unlaunch&quot; button on the 4080 12GB.&quot;

It&#x27;s part of what&#x27;s coming in the newly announced Batman DLC for Minecraft, as well as the ability to fight Batman&#x27;s rogue gallery including the Penguin, Poison Ivy and The Joker.

Well, a new mod for Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is here to help. It lets you order a real world pizza delivery from Domino&#x27;s via an in-game NPC. Magic.

If you don&#x27;t have access however, there&#x27;s still time as you can still apply and more players will be let in over the course of this weekend. You might also enjoy watching some streamers play so you have a better sense of it ahead of its release in November.

                              <span>Blocky action RPG Minecraft Dungeons sees the arrival of the mob-packed Fauna Faire, its third seasonal update, on October 19th. Today’s Minecraft Live stream showed more of what to expect from the new season of Minecraft Dungeons, including four-player multiplayer for the Tower, a new merchant who handles enchantments, and a free new jungle biome level. I just like the look of the mob-themed onesies, personally.

Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today&#x27;s Minecraft Live stream. Not even their names, alas. I was going to suggest Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grub, but then realised that leaves one short. Gandalf, maybe?

                              <span>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. 


Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Also, Wesley explains why he isn&#x27;t enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she&#x27;s been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

                              <span>In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don&#x27;t feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called &quot;Electromorphosis,&quot; which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.</span>

                              <span>Your hosts Wesley Leblanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Scorn, the new puzzle horror game from developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive. The two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it&#x27;s a game the two plan to continue playing. 
If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been following Scorn since its reveal years ago, or someone looking for an interesting Xbox console exclusive, look no further than today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Enjoy!


Scorn hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on October 14 (coming to both Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass too!) so if you&#x27;re reading this and are interested in checking the game out for yourself, you can download it today!

                              <span>Germany&#x27;s Federal Court of Justice has clarified the conditions under which rightsholders can seek site-blocking orders to restrict access to piracy sites. Deutsche Telekom had refused to implement DNS blocking against Sci-Hub and Libgen, arguing that more reasonable options were available to copyright holders. The Court agreed that website blocking should be a last resort.

Judero is its name, and a surprisingly action-heavy adventure through the Scottish Borders is its game. Expect folklore, witches, jokes, stop motion, and beasties to battle and mind control.

You&#x27;ve likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious &quot;standing on your own shoulders&quot; uses.
The balancing of all that didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I&#x27;m generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you&#x27;re more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

                              <span>Star Trek Online turns you into the captain of your own starship. This MMORPG neatly captures the essence of years of Gene Roddenberry’s hopeful, futuristic space romp, rolling in plotlines from the TV shows and movies to create a bizarrely playable blob of nerdy entertainment. It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

There will, however, be a targeted adjustment to tank Zarya in the next major patch going live on October 25th, Blizzard said.

EA and Motive just held a 14th anniversary livestream in honour of the original Dead Space – ivory, if you were wondering – and I can not-so-safely say that the new footage shown was crisp-gaggingly intimidating. You can check it out for yourself by watching the trailer below. Try not to be too long, won&#x27;t you?

                              <span>A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I&#x27;m alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It&#x27;s all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

                              <span>We started out today with a £300 SSD that somehow manages to be &#x27;good value&#x27; (in some sense of the word, at least!) and we end it with the other side of the spectrum: the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen on a 1TB NVMe SSD. Box are asking just £57 for this Integral M-Series model, which supports 2000MB/s reads and 1600MB/s writes. Compare that to £75.99 for the same drive on Amazon, and you&#x27;ve got the makings of a great deal.

Check out the demo for Voices Of The Void, an upcoming game about running a space radio telescope array. Alone. In the woods. It has a pleasing manual process to find, target, and analyse signals, and a whole complex of servers and machinery to mantain. Plus, y&#x27;know, a whole feeling of creeping dread from gazing into space and wondering if anyone is looking back.

                              <span>You know what&#x27;s quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today&#x27;s deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

So, not VR or Steam Deck hardware then.

Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

Things are working a little differently for 2022’s mob vote, though. Instead of casting your vote on Twitter, you’ll be able to head into a dedicated carnival-themed Bedrock server, do it in the Minecraft launcher, or on Minecraft.net. Devs Mojang will reveal which mob scored the most votes during the Minecraft Live livestream tomorrow.

                              <span>Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, &quot;Is there a story?&quot;. And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there&#x27;ll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it&#x27;s a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it&#x27;s about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that&#x27;s already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It&#x27;s about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It&#x27;s about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn&#x27;t have dialogue, or a map. It doesn&#x27;t really have a HUD, it doesn&#x27;t have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like &quot;Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it&#x27;ll open up a way forward!&quot; out loud. It won&#x27;t even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend it.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it&#x27;s discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let&#x27;s cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it&#x27;s nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you&#x27;re paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you&#x27;ll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

The date is November 18th, and there&#x27;s a new PC trailer below with the requisite big writing talking about new graphics features.

                              <span>I have wanted to play Triangle Strategy since it was first announced for Nintendo Switch, but I realise now that I know next to nothing about it. All I&#x27;ve done is look at its screenshots and salivate at the mixture of 2D sprites, 3D environments, and tilt-shift camera trickery. 

Beyond that, I know that it&#x27;s a strategy RPG, and I know that it&#x27;s out on PC as of today.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red recently updated Cyberpunk 2077 to add items from the new anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Their own updates didn&#x27;t add the show&#x27;s omnipresent risk of cyberpsychosis, however, so a modder has stepped in to do it for them. The Wannabe Edgerunner mod adds a &quot;humanity&quot; cost to all cyberware implants and certain actions in the open-world shooter, as well as consequences for when your humanity gets too low.

Inspired by new eco-friendly farming game Coral Island, which I&#x27;ve been playing this week, we talk about our favourite games that roll with an ecological protection theme. This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

                              <span>Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they&#x27;ll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope&#x27;s Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares&#x27; Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it&#x27;s Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You&#x27;re still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

                              <span>Galactic strategiser Stellaris is inviting players to muck about with adjustments to the game’s combat this month in an open beta, starting today. The beta is running from now until the end of October to trial planned changes and rummage up some feedback for Stellaris’ next update, 3.6 Orion. Don’t worry if you just fancy playing regular Stellaris; this is an opt-in thing. You can find out more by watching the video below.

It mostly consists of clips of the game’s dev team talking about playtests, but there are a few sections of gameplay and other footage from the game itself interspersed between those. Creative director Damien Kieken appears in the video, saying that the U in Project U “stands for Unite”.

                              <span>Fantasy construction sim Dwarf Fortress is, by the admission of its designers, difficult to learn and even harder to master. That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie. Annie bounced off the original, not-so-visually-appealing version of Dwarf Fortress. Yet, says Adams, the tutorial seems to be working to help Annie ease into the game at last.

You can watch Howard chatting about the make-believe space programme below, where he covers if Starfield is hard sci-fi (not really), the games traits system, and dialogue. It seems that Starfield RPG&#x27;s are incredibly chatty, with many times more dialogue than Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo&#x27;s BFF.

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
&quot;For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Dutch Internet provider Ziggo is not required to forward piracy warnings to its subscribers, an appeal court has ruled. This is a setback for anti-piracy group BREIN, which had hoped to warn frequent uploaders without undermining their privacy. Ironically, BREIN is required to take legal action against individual pirates if it wants to get its message across.

Blocking measures have expanded to 39 countries in recent years, with the United States remaining the key absentee. The lack of US participation is partly due to a shortcoming in US copyright law, which lacks a carve-out for no-fault injunctions.

Well, good news chums, EVGA&#x27;s RTX 2060 SC Gaming model is available for £212 - and despite costing 12.5% the price of the RTX 4090, it delivers at least 25% of the performance - nice. That&#x27;s like, double the value!

This is a 32-inch model, offering a 2560x1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate and a DisplayHDR 600 certification that means it actually delivers impactful HDR - a rarity at this price point. Anyway, it&#x27;s down to £499 today after a £100 discount, so listen up - here&#x27;s why I rate this monitor so highly.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

                              <span>In each issue, Game Informer prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We&#x27;d like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.
You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>It looks like Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is heading to Steam, with Activision Blizzard announcing the news in an unorthodox fashion. The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game 
The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

                              <span>More than six years after its original release, No Man&#x27;s Sky is finally out on Switch today alongside the new Waypoint update, which brings the game up to a new 4.0 version. This update is live on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC as of today. 
As for what to expect, Waypoint is best described as a major overhaul to No Man&#x27;s Sky geared toward making the game easily tailored to players, regardless of the experience they&#x27;re trying to get out of it. If you want something more relaxing and casual, you can do that. If you want a more challenging experience, the Waypoint update lets you do that too. 
&quot;Access the universe of No Man&#x27;s Sky from anywhere in update 4.0 Waypoint, launching for the first time on Nintendo Switch, and overhauling fundamental elements of gameplay including game modes, inventory size, and usability, milestones, journey cataloging, and much more,&quot; the No Man&#x27;s Sky Waypoint blog post reads. &quot;Tailor every aspect of the game to your unique playstyle with custom game modes. Launch into the action quickly with an existing difficulty preset, or tinker with everything from economy to combat challenge to survival difficulty to perfect your experience.&quot; 
Alongside today&#x27;s Switch release and Waypoint update, Hello Games has released a new trailer giving a tease of what to expect in the 4.0 version of the game: 


As you can see, Waypoint is bringing a lot of changes to No Man&#x27;s Sky. Alongside game mode customization, there are also new seamless auto-saves, the launch of trade rockets, a new inventory overhaul with streamlined item management, unique Switch rewards, and so much more. Be sure to read the entire Waypoint blog post for all the details.

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

October 7, 2022
The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

                              <span>The new guards of Batman&#x27;s city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. 
Which of the Gotham Knights will you be maining? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have revealed that Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Great, Daddy Day Care) will star in the studio&#x27;s next game, which remains unannounced. 
This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

                              <span>When Bayonetta 3&#x27;s first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game&#x27;s focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here&#x27;s a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta&#x27;s backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world,&quot; and it turns out he&#x27;s right in that we&#x27;ve never heard Pratt&#x27;s voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie&#x27;s villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you&#x27;d expect, in line with Illumination&#x27;s other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the hotly anticipated sequel to 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare reboot, is out in just a few weeks, and Infinity Ward has released a new trailer to highlight what to expect during the game&#x27;s story campaign. 
Returning favorites from 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare like Ghost and Price make an appearance in the trailer as do newcomers to the series, both good and bad, all to the backdrop of the war on drugs, cartels, terrorism, and more. It&#x27;s all very Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and you can check it out for yourself below:

Armed with a book of knowledge, or Pink Digital Assistant, your mission will be to save children from dangerous threats and undo a spell cast on a little girl who has been transformed into a wombat. To succeed you will need to visit several countries and even travel into the past. On your way you will encounter historical monuments and exhibits.
The ScummVM team is proud to announce that The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril and The Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink are finally ready for their testing period.
If you want to help with the tests, use the latest daily build of ScummVM to play the Windows version of the games. Please report any issues you encounter on our bug tracker. Be sure to follow our testing and bug reporting guidelines.
