                              <span>“WHELP. IT HAPPENED,” begins the tweet from Lilith Walther (b0tster on Twitter), one of the developers behind Bloodborne Kart, a fanmade spin-off of the popular FromSoftware game. Sony has allegedly contacted them requesting the removal of copyrighted content from the game.


“Long story short I need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart, which we will do. But that requires a short delay,” they continue. However, they add that “the game is still coming out! It&#x27;ll just look slightly different.”




It’s not entirely surprising since the Bloodborne Kart directly references the title of the 2015 PS4 game and includes characters from it. The game is a “meme made real,” originating from an April Fool’s Day Tweet back in 2021. What is surprising is that it has taken so long, as the game has been in open development for quite some time now. It’s perhaps because, a few months ago, it was given the release date of January 31, which is next week.


Of course, the developers were planning to release the game for free, but it’s still infringing on the company’s copyright. It’s honestly not at all surprising, which Lilith states themself in another tweet, saying, “Like I&#x27;ve said in multiple interviews, we were all expecting this to happen so we could be pleasantly surprised if it didn&#x27;t.”


It’s definitely a bummer, and I feel bad for the development team who were looking forward to putting their creation in the hands of fans, but they’re taking it in stride. Lilith says, “Turning this into an original game that we have full creative control over is kind of exciting. This is a fan game no more!”


Lilith says that they are current uncertain of what the new release date will be for the rebranded Bloodborne Kart, but they hope to share news as soon as possible.

Half weren’t very good, half felt like tech demos, and half were Virtual Boy Wario Ware. If a game didn’t fit into any of those three halves, it stuck out like a missing tooth.


Panic Bomber was one of those games. It’s a perfectly find match-3 puzzle game, with a heaping of Bomberman charm. It just didn’t benefit from being on the hardware in the slightest. The Virtual Boy had its advantages, but it’s hardly the ideal way to play a puzzle game.


Thankfully, it wasn’t exclusive to the crimson goggles. It originally came out on PC-Engine Super CD-ROM² in 1994 and was ported to a number of platforms. Unfortunately, the only other time it came out in North America was a port on Wii U. Thankfully again,…</span>

                              <span>During the Warframe Devstream 176, developer Digital Extremes revealed plans for the next big update, Dante Unbound. Scheduled to release in March 2024, the update will bring the 56th Warframe to the popular action RPG MMO.

56th Warframe: Dante, Master of Reality&#x27;s Pages


The highlight of the new update is of course the new Warframe, Dante. Described as a classic-MMO caster, Dante is accompanied by his own Exalted Weapon, Noctua. A Dante-bound Grimoire, Noctua obliterates enemies by pelting them with spectral pages and cursed paper cuts. I have to admit, being cut up by cursed pages of a magical spellbook sounds pretty brutal.


The living sandstorm Warframe Inaros is also getting a long overdue rework with the update, with full details on the rework to come soon.


Quality-of-life updates and return of TennoGen


TennoGen, a unique system in Warframe comprised of unique customizations created by fellow Warframe players, is finally making a return in the March update. TennoGen is essentially a collaborative program between community artists and Digital Extremes developers to add purchasable cosmetics to the game while sharing revenue with the artists who created them.


The TennoGen system has been updated, and will now accept submissions under the new Entrati style that was added in the recent Whispers in the Walls update that was released in December. Fans will now be able to create Warframe skins, Weapon skins, Operator accessories, Landing Craft skins, and more as part of Tennogen.


Dante looks like a pretty cool caster Warframe, so I&#x27;m excited to hear more. The Dante Unbound update for Warframe will release in March 2024.

And one familiar face, Nancy, returns as a Poundmate summon in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth with a new pal Olivia in tow. It&#x27;s a tag-team you won&#x27;t want to miss.


To start off, you&#x27;ll need to head to Hawaii and bring Nancy along. As far as I know, it&#x27;s not actually possible to leave Nancy back in Japan; I chose to bring her because I&#x27;m not a monster, but I&#x27;ve heard if you do make the emphatically, objectively wrong choice, she still comes along.


Once in Hawaii, kick off the substory &quot;Coming Out of Her Shell.&quot; You&#x27;ll get it on the beach fairly early on in the game. It was one of the first substories I undertook, not long after the open world area of Hawaii opened up to me. Check…</span>

                              <span>Mr. Podunkian revealed the Steam store page for their upcoming city life simulator, Sunkissed City, which is coming to PC sometime in late 2024.


Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the handheld version of The Urbz. Nor does it look like the console version of The Urbz. It looks more like Stardew Valley, which makes sense because Mr. Podunkian previously worked at Stardew Valley developer Concerned Ape. If you liked Stardew Valley, but felt like it needed more concrete, then this might be for you.


In Sunkissed City, you don’t actually live in a place called “Sunkissed City.” It’s Apollo City, which is similar. There you take care of DIY gardens, get to know the locals, and try to solve the mystery of why everyone has been feeling crappy. There’s even fishing, which I think is maybe a law for developing these sorts of games. You can also play co-op with friends if you&#x27;re that sort of person.


I’m liking the looks of Sunkissed City. I like farming sims, but having grown up in a rural area, I prefer being an urban dweller because food is closer, and I don’t drive. While I’m still waiting for someone to adapt the gentle mix of adventure game and life simulator found in the handheld versions of The Urbz, that’s a different matter. For now, I’ll just be happy if I’m able to space out at the magazine rack at the 7/11 around midnight.


Sunkissed City is currently targeting a release at the end of 2024.

Initially, that was all thanks to its biggest hook  — playing as a cat. A nameless, adorable stray that had many charmed before it&#x27;d even launched. 



And, to my surprise, what originally sounded like a gimmick turned out to be one of the year&#x27;s most creative platformers. Refreshingly, Stray had proven me wrong. 


In Stray, you&#x27;re an orange tabby in an underground cyberpunk world of robots, many of whom have lost hope that there is a world outside. In a surprisingly heartwarming story with the robot B-12, you go on your quest to find your way home. It&#x27;s a semi-open world, giving you areas to explore along its linear tale. In typi…</span>

For years now, Bungie has held seasonal votes for Destiny 2&#x27;s Halloween Festival of the Lost events, allowing the community to decide which armor sets would eventually be made available. Naturally, not everyone is always thrilled with the results of the vote, but this year&#x27;s results have riled up way more of a crowd than usual.

                              <span>Well, it looks like more Switch successor rumors are swirling. A new report has emerged today stating that the Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) is indeed targeting a 2024 release, and with an LCD screen. 


The news comes from Takashi Mochizuki and Yuki Furukawa of Bloomberg. The duo cited Hiroshi Hayase, an analyst for Omdia. Hayase states that Nintendo intends to double the production of &quot;amusement displays&quot; throughout 2024. They also noted that the sequel system would feature an 8-inch LCD screen. The Switch OLED, released over two years ago, houses a 7-inch screen, and the original Switch houses a 6.2-inch LCD screen.




Omdia is a London-based consultancy firm focused on telecommunications, media, and technology. Sure, it&#x27;s just another analyst (albeit a credible one) saying the next Nintendo console is coming soon. But all of the more recent Switch successor rumors are beginning to line up. 


Also noted in today&#x27;s Bloomberg article is a reminder that Shark Corp., an LCD panel supplier, was revealed to be supplying LCD screens for an upcoming gaming console. The company has an established relationship with Nintendo, as they worked to assemble Switch consoles during the pandemic.


If 2024 is indeed when we can expect Nintendo&#x27;s next console, we could hopefully be hearing something relatively soon. The Switch was showcased in trailer form on October 20, 2016. That&#x27;s less than five months before the Nintendo Switch launched on March 7, 2017.


If we go by the logic of history repeating itself and assume that a Switch 2 will be out before the kickoff of holiday shopping around Black Friday, we may be seeing Nintendo making an official reveal of their wildly popular hybrid console around mid-June. Just in time for this year&#x27;s Summer Game Fest and other gaming events. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see.

The latest entry in the Tekken series went live last night, and I hopped on for a few rounds with friends myself—said pals were playing on PC, and I was on PlayStation 5. It was quite surprising when we continuously ran into issues with crashing while trying to create and run an online lobby match. Whether PC-to-PC, or on crossplay, both platforms kept seeing crashes.


It doesn&#x27;t look like we were alone in this, either. Players were posting about it on various social forums, sites were starting to write about it, and Katsuhiro Harada himself made a statement. Per the Tekken official account, it was due to &quot;a high concentration of users connecting to matc…</span>

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios has opened up some new positions for an upcoming project that&#x27;s being built in Unreal Engine 5. It seems the studio is on the hunt for additional talent, just months after last August&#x27;s layoffs. 


As reported by VGC, Twitter user MauroNL – a games industry analyst – has noted that Striking Distance is embarking on a new venture. A total of nine vacancies have become available, with the studio intending to create something brand-new.




Some of the positions include a Lead Technical Artist, UI Technical Artist, Lead Gameplay Animator, and a Lead Gameplay Engineer. What this elusive project will be is anyone&#x27;s guess at this stage.


Can only go up from here, yeah?


With 32 people being laid off from the studio and director Glen Schofield leaving last September, things didn&#x27;t look good for Striking Distance. The Callisto Protocol should have been a slam-dunk, particularly with it being billed as a spiritual successor to Dead Space.


However, poor performance left people unimpressed with the developer&#x27;s first release. While recent scores on Steam have it at &quot;Mostly Positive,&quot; overall it remains &quot;Mixed.&quot; Even with patches to fix issues, the damage appeared to have already been done.


Now that a new game is said to be in the works, maybe some will give Callisto Protocol another chance. Still, what&#x27;s left of the team is still trucking along on something. Maybe the next one will be more of a success.

                              <span>Earlier in the year (wait... it&#x27;s still January?!) we mentioned how Hitman: Blood Money was making an appearance on the Switch. Well, that day has now arrived, and this special &quot;Reprisal&quot; edition comes with some features just for this port.


If you have a Switch and you&#x27;re a fan of some of the more classic entries in the Hitman franchise, this one may be worth a look-in. It released on January 25 and, according to the Nintendo website, this version features &quot;gameplay improvements inspired by later games in the series,&quot; including Instinct Mode.




It&#x27;s also been given an &quot;an artful redesign of a stealth-action classic,&quot; which has been specially adapted for the hybrid console.


Not bad for an 18-year-old game


The timing of this is pretty nifty (if you have a Switch, of course). With the Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy about to leave Xbox Game Pass, Blood Money - Reprisal will keep your thirst for Agent 47 well and truly sated.


Many consider the 2006 entry one of the best of the series. I only managed to play it for the first time a couple of years ago, and I can see the appeal. Personally, I&#x27;m utterly in love with the recent installments and will be sad to see them exiting Game Pass.


I&#x27;m also one of those rare specimens that actually really enjoyed Absolution. I understand the criticisms people had, but the fact that it was the first Hitman game I actually managed to get all the way through makes it special to me (you never forget your first).

                              <span>Inin Games and NatsumeAtari have released a new trailer of Tengo Project’s upcoming remake, Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn. This one shows the new game side-by-side with the 1990 original.


If there’s one thing gamers love, it’s comparing things. Shadow of the Ninja is the oldest game that Tengo Project has remade from Natsume’s back catalog, and being on the NES, it was built on limited hardware. Rather than simply spruce up the game like with Wild Guns: Reloaded or create an entirely new entry in the series like Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined, they’ve kind of found a comfortable place in between. The levels are reminiscent of the original, but everything has been overhauled with new abilities and enemy placement.




I think it looks pretty great! Placed next to the remake, the 8-bit original looks incredibly sparse. It was actually a decent-looking game for the time period, but the NES was very restrictive when it came to how much you could jam on screen at one time. Tengo Project has already shown off some great pixel art chops with their previous games.


The remake will have new weapons, a new level, and an upgraded soundtrack by the original composer, Iku Mizutani.


I wonder where Tengo Project will go next. My first guess would be S.C.A.T., but what I’m really hoping for is Abadox. I guess we should wait and see how Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn turns out.


Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in Summer 2024.

                              <span>Ultrawings 2 originally released in October 2022, receiving good reviews. You can grab it on Steam and the Meta Quest, and to the surprise of the developers, on the PS VR2 as well. 




Bit Planet Games expressed as much shock as players when the game suddenly appeared on the PS Store. The studio has mostly taken it in stride, describing it as a &quot;shadow drop&quot; despite how the sudden release has robbed the team of prior marketing for the new version. According to the devs, a patch is on the way, though many players on the r/PSVR subreddit claim it runs well despite the lack of a day-one patch. 




When asked, the team confirmed that the launch was entirely unforeseen. Fortunately, the team is not stuck with a broken game and those who have jumped in are experiencing minimal issues. Sony hasn&#x27;t commented on the matter. 


It goes without saying that fans on PS5 are delighted, though they do express sympathy for the developers. The team also confirms that a physical edition is probably never coming. 


It&#x27;s described as an island-themed aerial action-adventure game and while I have admittedly never played it, the praise and trailers have piqued my interest.

                              <span>Back in December, the social deduction phenomenon Among Us crossed over with Vampire Survivors. The result was a surprisingly fun (and cheap) DLC called Emergency Meeting that launched on every available platform....except Switch. 


Thankfully, that&#x27;s changed as of this week.


Poncle confirms that the Among Us DLC and Adventures are now live on Switch


Thanks to a tweet from developer poncle, we have full confirmation that Emergency Meeting and Adventures are live on Switch.


So I mentioned that the Among Us DLC was cheap. How cheap? Try $2.50, with a 10% discount through the rest of the month (January 29 at 2:59AM ET to be exact). Note, however, that you may need to search for the Emergency Meeting DLC directly on the eShop, as the official shop page doesn&#x27;t list it yet.


Adventures are the other big addition to the Switch version and include extra quests and challenges (which are essentially remixed versions of existing content). Adventures are free on all platforms, but you will need to own the appropriate DLC to play the DLC portions.


Interestingly enough, all versions of the game (Steam, Switch, Xbox, iOS, and Android) now have feature parity...except the bizarre Tesla edition of the game, which just got the wintery Whiteout update several weeks ago.

                              <span>For realsies this time, Skull &amp; Bones launches on February 16. If the pirate game has managed to keep you curious all this time, look out for the open access running from February 8 until 11. 


It is worth noting that Ubisoft+ games can grab the game earlier on February 13. You have several choices including PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, and PC via Epic where you can enjoy crossplay and cross-progression throughout the platforms.

Skull &amp; Bones in 2024


The game is an open-world tactical action world title with both single and multiplayer elements. For those looking to play the multiplayer aspects, there will be stronger items introduced to help you take on the increasingly difficult opponents, including warships. 


You&#x27;ll be able to grow your empire by taking control of trade routes. There are also hostile takeovers where the winners get to take control of manufacturing plants. At post-launch, new features will be introduced, including the ability to assign fleets of ships to your trade routes, to the ability to bribe officials. 




Is this the pirate game we&#x27;ve been waiting ages for? February 8 we&#x27;ll learn whether it has the chance to live up to the hype of years of waiting.

                              <span>Dating sims are harder to create than people give them credit for. Hundreds of thousands of words, dialogue trees that stretch to the horizon and take into account successes and failures, trying to fit in as many characters as possible to suit different preferences; the complexity piles up and threatens to collapse. It gets more difficult when you try to merge it with another genre.


I’ve seen failure happen many times throughout my years as Destructoid’s resident self-proclaimed dating sim expert. There’s a reason why games like Mass Effect usually have relationships no more complex than “listen to life story, complete side quest, bang.” Anything more ambitious leads to juggling problems, and it takes a lot of talent and planning to handle all those balls.

The set-top boxes that served as gateways were sold through Amazon stores.

Meanwhile, a third regional police force&#x27;s website appears to have been transformed into an illegal sports streaming platform.

Nintendo has kicked off 2024 with a rather unexpected remake in Another Code: Recollection, which bundles together Ashley Mizuki Robbins&#x27; two adventures from the DS and Wii era. Beloved by those who played it back in the day, the Switch version is the first time many people have been able to experience the mystery of Ashley&#x27;s family. While the first game, Another Code: Two Memories (or Trace Memory) saw a worldwide release, Another Code: R - A Journey into Lost Memories never launched in North America.
Arc System Works has taken the reins in what is a far departure from the studio&#x27;s usual gaming output — perhaps we&#x27;ll see Ashley in a future Guilty Gear game?

We love Trombone Champ for its silly party fun and its ability to ruin even the most classic of classical hits. We also love it for the frequency of its content updates, the latest of which is now available to download on Switch.
Developer Holy Wow Studios has split the ver. 1.26A update between fixes and newbies, adding in two brand new songs (&#x27;Habanera&#x27; from Carmen and &#x27;Trombone Skyze (Nasty Mix)&#x27;) as well as making some localisation changes and improving the UI in multiplayer modes. Oh, and those using tilt controls can also move the controller left and right to make their character dance now — there&#x27;s a game-changer for you!

Nintendo underlined its omnipresence in the Asian gaming market with a stacked booth at this week’s Taipei Game Show, where crowds of Taiwanese gamers have been piling in to snap photos with an animatronic Kirby and try out tentpole titles like Super Mario Wonder.
While none of the platform holder’s upcoming outings like Princess Peach: Showtime! were on display, the Big N is using the event to flex the sheer breadth of its catalogue.

                              <span>Go, ninja, go!
Nintendo fans may be familiar with Good-Feel, a Japanese developer that collaborated with the Big N to produce titles such as Wario Land: Shake It!, Kirby’s Epic Yarn, and Yoshi’s Woolly and Crafted Worlds. Yet despite its work with Nintendo, Good Feel is still an independent company and occasionally produces new games with its own IP, and at the very end of November 2023 the studio released Switch-exclusive Otogi Katsugeki Mameda no Bakeru: Oracle Saitarou no Sainan!!.
Taking strongly after the Ganbare Goemon games (Etsunobu Ebisu worked at Konami before founding Good-Feel in 2005 and was a key figure behind the Mystical Ninja series), this new release mixes 3D platforming with some light beat-&#x27;em-up elements to make for an impressively enjoyable experience. The only catch is that it’s exclusively available in Japan at the time of writing, but don’t let that deter you from trying this worthwhile platformer.

Just when we thought that we had shaken the Vampire Survivors bug that seemed to sink its teeth into us last year and not let go, Poncle Games goes and drops not one, but two new reasons to dive into the uber-addictive roguelike all over again.
Neither the Adventure Mode nor the Among Us &#x27;Emergency Meeting&#x27; DLC are new reveals at this point — both having been revealed back in December), but after seeing a release on other platforms last year, we are pleased to finally have them on Switch now too.

Just this week, we got a look at a brand-new trailer and some tie-in pastel pink Joy-Con, so it seems only right that Nintendo would start to advertise the upcoming game&#x27;s pre-order bonuses now too.

Some more industry news has broken this week, and this time it relates to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox division, which last year finalised its acquisition of Activision Blizzard and has in recent times reiterated its support for Nintendo platforms.
In a message from the Xbox and Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer (via IGN), it&#x27;s been revealed 1,900 roles out of 22,000 in total across the team have been axed.

                              <span>A planned live-action adaptation of MMO Final Fantasy XIV is officially “dead”, according to the TV series’ producers. A combination of the pandemic and the “size and scale needed to do it right” are apparently to blame, with Amazon reportedly coming closest to making it a reality - but to no avail.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played certain demos for longer than I have many full games, eking every last atom of enjoyment out of a single level or character, to the point that the final release felt like unnecessary bloat. I am already concerned the same might be true of Arco&#x27;s demo, which is now available on Steam. You&#x27;ve hopefully read Katharine&#x27;s breakdown of this &quot;triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape&quot;. Well, now&#x27;s your chance to get to grips with its nifty combat system, which is broken into turns with each turn&#x27;s actions unfolding in real time.

                              <span>My inbox is absolutely rammed with early Steam Next Fest demos at the moment. Honestly, did no one remember that February&#x27;s Next Fest starts in, you know, February, in a week a bit&#x27;s time this year? I&#x27;m all for getting a few things early to make the deluge of demos a bit more manageable to cover, but this year has just been a teensy bit insane. Now there&#x27;s too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I&#x27;m making steady progress, and you&#x27;ve probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that&#x27;s sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner.

You have to supervise them constantly, not relax and watch them grow organically while eating a sandwich and only occasionally intervening like a neglectful goddess.
Writer&#x27;s Rush is sort of, sort of an idle game, I&#x27;d argue. It&#x27;s a low pressure, low stakes, super light sim that takes the barest hint of the clicker and crosses it with sort of-sort of-sort of score attack, and somehow works without quite feeling like either. Because, I think, of its charmingly, intentionally daft representation of what being a novelist is like.

A lot of people seem delighted to rocket around in the colourful adventures of pizzeria proprietor Peppino Spaghetti. People who are younger than me. People whose hands aren&#x27;t gnarled claws. People who don&#x27;t have one foot in the grave. It&#x27;ll happen to you too. In the meantime, I hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed it, and suspect you might be keen to see more of the new playable character coming free in a future update.

                              <span>Good news, Horizon likers. Not only have Sony announced a release date for the PC version of Horizon Forbidden West&#x27;s Complete Edition - mark your calendars for March 21st, folks - but they&#x27;ve also released a new trailer showing off all the various PC features. Chief among them for me is proper support for PS5 Dualsense controllers, which means you should be able to benefit from all the same haptic feedback ripples and adaptive trigger pulls of Aloy&#x27;s bow as folks did on PS5.

                              <span>Now see here Ollie Toms, supposed guides editor of this supposed videogames website - if Enshrouded really does have &quot;the best building system in the survival genre&quot; then why does the floor of my hovel look like a petrified sneeze? I was innocently carving myself a nice stone foundation last night when the Devil jogged my elbow and I dug a massive, raggedy trench straight through it. I&#x27;ve spent an hour now trying to fill in the trench and flatten it out, to no avail. There&#x27;s always a jaggedy bit right in the middle, and I&#x27;m getting displaced trypophobia from the awareness that my efforts have seeded the terrain beneath with random cavities.
What&#x27;s worse, there is no mention of enhancing the floor-levelling functionality in this Keen Games forum post on Enshrouded&#x27;s various launch issues, which they are even now racing to fix. Instead, it&#x27;s all talk of frame rates, multiplayer stability and dedicated servers not appearing. Somebody rush me a cement mixer, stat, or I&#x27;m moving back to Valheim.

Just when you thought it couldn&#x27;t get any more remarkable, Ubisoft have also announced it&#x27;ll get an open beta before it launches. In only a couple of weeks, you&#x27;ll be able to sail the seven seas with a purple rarity cannon firing off common rarity cannon balls that you bought off a rank 25 landlubber with your Skullbucks.

You run away from the country to start a new life in the big city, obviously. Arthur &quot;Mr. Podunkian&quot; Lee - a former contributor to ConcernedApe&#x27;s genre-defining farmalot Stardew Valley - has announced Sunkissed City, a life simulation game set in a delightful coastal burb that&#x27;s reportedly &quot;pumping with funky vibes and quirky characters&quot;, together with migraines, stretches of dead water and horrible sewer monsters.

                              <span>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t exactly spawned from the most hardware-bothering of game series. Most previous LADs, be they Kiryu’s Adventures in Punching or the more turn-based reboot have all been technically gentle affairs, and Infinite Wealth is ultimately another one. At the same time, it shares with Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name a newfound interest in PC-specific tricks. That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.
Let’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC. We’ll also work out its best settings, to keep it running smoother than a legally distinct Segway.

                              <span>While Intel typically does a great job with their open-source Linux hardware support with enabling all features under Linux and doing so in a timely manner -- often well in advance of the client and server hardware availability -- an exception in recent years has been around the web cam support for many newer Intel laptops. Since Alder Lake an increasing number of Intel-powered laptops have been relying on a raw MIPI camera sensor connected to the IPU6 IP. Intel has been tightly controlling the intellectual property around IPU6 so in turn their Linux support has consisted of an out-of-tree kernel driver and a proprietary user-space component. But thanks to Linaro and Red Hat, an open-source alternative has been forming...</span>

                              <span>Three years ago, base builder and space simulation game Dyson Sphere Program was released and quite frankly blew my mind. I had already invested over 1,000 hours in Factorio and over 100 hours into Satisfactory, so I knew Dyson Sphere Program would be a game for me. What I didn&#x27;t expect, however, was the massive scope of the game.


If you haven&#x27;t played it—you really owe it to yourself to—Dyson Sphere Program basically drops you onto a planet in a bigger solar system, where you have to build up functioning factories to harvest the resources on the planet and tech up. Eventually, you&#x27;ll leave that planet to find others with different resources, then set up a massive solar system-spanning production line that eventually expands across the galaxy. All of this with one goal in mind: to build …</span>

                              <span>If you thought the idea of a live-action Final Fantasy XIV series sounded like a massive undertaking, you&#x27;d be right. One of the executive producers, Dinesh Shamdasani of Hivemind Entertainment, recently confirmed that the project has been canceled. 


When asked about the status of the live-action Final Fantasy XIV on Twitter, Shamdasani straight up said it&#x27;s &quot;dead.&quot; While they had a &quot;fantastic pilot script&quot; by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton (Winter&#x27;s Knight) and a multi-season plan, everything was rejected. According to Shamdasani, it was the risk inherent to the &quot;size and scale&quot; of the project that ultimately did it in. Apparently, Amazon came the closest to footing the bill for this one. 




Writer Jake Thornton chimed in, as well, citing Covid as one of the culprits behind the decision. &quot;We took it out just as studios began to zip up their purse strings,&quot; Thornton added. 


As for whether or not animation would be more suitable for something like Final Fantasy XIV, Shamdasani was quick to put an end to any further hope for the series, at least for now. Not only did he say that animation would be more difficult, he mentioned that they no longer have the rights to the title. 


Eorzea out of sight


Plans for the live-action Final Fantasy XIV were first revealed back in 2019, and had Square Enix teaming up with Sony Pictures Television and Hivemind. The initial announcement promised a new story set in Eorzea along with series mainstays like Chocobos, airships, and even the &quot;live-action debut of Cid.&quot; 


Hivemind previously worked with Netflix on The Witcher and with Amazon on The Expanse, so the experience and potential was there. For the time being, at least we&#x27;ll always have Dad of Light.

                              <span>Announced in September, we&#x27;ve been awaiting confirmation as to when the Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition would launch on PC. Today, Sony gave us our answer. 


The Complete Edition dropped for PlayStation 5 on October 6. It brought with it a slew of bonus content on top of the revered Burning Shores expansion. All of this will be included within the PC Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, now slated to release on March 21.




The majority of the PC Complete Edition&#x27;s content is similar to that of the PlayStation 5 version, But the PC port has some additional bells and whistles that will excite those with more heftier hardware. PC players will have the option to unlock frame rates, personalize their graphics settings, and enjoy advanced performance features like NVIDIA&#x27;s DLSS 3 upscaling and frame generation.


As for monitors, ultra-wide support has been implemented so that PC players can enjoy all of Forbidden West&#x27;s incredible environments. You&#x27;ll have the ability to go as far as a triple monitor setup, with resolution options including 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9.


Mouse and keyboard controls are fully customizable, of course. Steam Input support is implemented so that you can remap your controller of choice. Including the PlayStation DualSense which allows PC players to enjoy Guerilla Games&#x27; use of the controller&#x27;s haptic feedback abilities. 


As for the Complete Edition&#x27;s bonus content, there are a handful of new outfits and weapons that will be available for download. Also included are a resource pack, an Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike Piece, and an exclusive Photo Mode pose and face paint that&#x27;s only in the Complete Edition. You can get the full breakdown over on the PlayStation Blog.


PC players can begin playing the Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition on March 21. If you&#x27;ve yet to check out Forbidden West, you should. It&#x27;s pretty great.

                              <span>While I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m bad at games by any stretch, I know a game I&#x27;ll be bad at when I see one. NanoApostle is one such game, and the frenetic boss rush actioner from developer 18Light Game (Pronty) is due out on PC in summer 2024. 


Who cares if I&#x27;ll be bad at it, though. You might not be! It certainly seems exciting enough, and the intense boss battles at its core are on full display in the announcement trailer from publisher PQube. 




NanoApostle puts you in the role of a nanomachine-augmented child named Anita. As she attempts to escape a top secret facility, she comes face to face with a bunch of cybernetic experiments that certainly seem to have &quot;gone wrong.&quot; Or maybe they&#x27;ve gone exactly as their creator intended? Either way, she has to beat &#x27;em all up using a &quot;Destruction Point&quot; battle system. As the name implies, this involves using Anita&#x27;s Apostle nanites to identify structural weaknesses in enemies and land decisive hits.


Destined to die


The stages themselves are something you&#x27;ll have to contend with, too. Some of the environments will warp and advance as bosses become more aggressive. As one might expect from a game like NanoApostle, it results in the need for a lot of well-timed dodging and parrying. You&#x27;ll also need to be strategic with the way you utilize skill points to decide upon your personal approach to combat. 


It all looks and sounds very cool, even if it smacks of a game that I&#x27;ll pick up and get frustrated with almost immediately. For a lot of folks, that&#x27;s a key selling point, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m not immediately drawn in by the promise of any game that falls in the Oops! All Bosses! category a la Furi. Hey, why not, bring on the punishment.

                              <span>Tower Bosses in Palworld are tough to take down due to their powerful skills and massive health pools. It sure would be great if you can capture them, right? Actually, as of now, you can use a glitch or exploit to capture tower bosses in Palworld. 


The glitch seems to have been discovered by a user on Reddit a few days ago. Following the patch on January 25 for both Steam and Xbox versions, the exploit still exists. I managed to capture two Zoe &amp; Grizzbolt Tower Bosses for my Palworld team using the glitch. 


Steps to capture tower bosses in Palworld using a glitch


I would say the best thing about this glitch is how simple it is to pull off. I attempted it four times and managed to capture two bosses, giving me a 50/50 chance to get away with it.

                              <span>Are you tired of long-running live service games with no end in sight? Well, Bushiroad&#x27;s Love Live! School Idol Festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE! isn&#x27;t just getting a global launch date; it&#x27;s also getting a global closure date, at the same time.


In a tweet from the SIF account, the company says it is &quot;excited to break the news to you that the global version of Love Live! School Idol Festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE! is launching soon in February 2024.&quot; Then, in the next paragraph: &quot;However, we also want to inform you that, the Global Version will close its doors on May 31, 2024, and cease in-app purchases accordingly.&quot;




It is a little surreal, to see a launch and closure in the same tweet like that. Mobile games spinning up, making their cash, and closing down later isn&#x27;t exactly news, but doing it all in one fell swoop? Incredible.


Grand opening, grand closing


As the text notes, this is the global version specifically. Per Gematsu, the School Idol Festival 2 opened its doors in Japan for iOS and Android on April 15, 2023. It&#x27;s also closing earlier than the global version, on March 31, 2024. So while the global version won&#x27;t make it three months, the game as a whole will not have made it a full year on either version.


Part of me has to wonder whether this is due to some sort of obligation, that the global version is even going live at all. Or maybe this is just the most nihilistic take on mobile gacha games yet.


The games industry has not been easy on anybody lately, so I do have a lot of sympathy for the developers who put work into making something for the Love Live! fans and have to see their work disappear so fast. Maybe a third School Idol Festival will see more time in the light than this particular entry in the Love Live! canon.

The first time was back in 2011 with AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome. AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!

                              <span>According to reporting from Kotaku, Black Forest Games has announced the termination of 50% of its overall workforce, which was said to be around 110 employees in 2023. They join a growing list of layoffs experienced in the industry, which continues to accelerate from last year.


Black Forest Games is a German Developer who was responsible for Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, Titan Quest, and the recent Destroy All Humans remasters. They are currently working on an adaptation of the comic book mini-series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin.  


Black Forest Games is a subsidiary of THQ Nordic who, in turn, is a subsidiary of Embracer Group, a publisher who was rather central in the mass of layoffs that occurred through 2023. The company spent much of last year cutting back staff throughout all its many subsidiaries, following explosive expansionism and the fall-through of a large investment.


A huge contraction of the industry has made this a distressing time for anyone who loves the medium. 2023 was already a huge year for job losses in the industry, while 2024 is already shaping up to be worse. Kotaku is keeping a running tally of video game (and adjacent) layoffs, and by their count, we’re already approaching nearly 6,000 in the first month of the year.


It’s hard to say what our beloved hobby will look like when all of this finally slows down, but it’s rather difficult to stay optimistic.

                              <span>Last year, we reported that Twitch was introducing a new Partner Plus Program, which brought with it changes to how streamers are paid. While it was met with some praise, it was also criticized for certain threshold requirements. As a result, the company has implemented a few changes.


In a recent blog, Twitch announced its updated payouts for Partner Plus. For starters, it&#x27;s now allowing Affiliated rather than just Partners to be included in the program. The changes also lower the threshold from 350 to 300, which means more streamers can qualify.




When the scheme began last October, it adjusted the 50/50 split to a 70/30 one, giving streamers more income. Now, with a lower threshold of 100 Plus Point (presumably this is in relation to how many subscribers channels have), a new Level 1 entry point will give content creators a 60/40 split, while Level 2 retains the 70/30 split.


Twitch has received &quot;clear feedback&quot;


Additionally, when the Partner Plus Program (which is dropping the &quot;Partner&quot; from the name) was first introduced, it put a cap on how much streamers could earn. In a nutshell, anyone whose revenue was $100k or more would go back down to the 50/50 split. This idea has now been scrapped.


The program was met with some backlash from the community, many of whom were concerned that the 350 subscriber threshold was unobtainable for many channels. Add onto that the income cap, and it was not Twitch&#x27;s finest hour.


However, judging by responses to its Twitter thread on the news, it seems many are much happier with these new changes that will be coming into effect this May.

                              <span>The Last of Us Part II&#x27;s about to be seen in a whole new way. Grounded 2, a making-of documentary for The Last of Us Part II, premieres next week.


In a post on Naughty Dog&#x27;s Twitter, the studio confirms the new documentary arrives on February 2. It&#x27;s a follow-up to Grounded, the making-of for the first Last of Us, and will head to both YouTube and in-game for those who own The Last of Us: Part II Remastered.




The documentary premieres at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET for those waiting on the YouTube upload.

                              <span>Depending on who you ask, indie games are the bread-and-butter of modern gaming, and there&#x27;s certainly merit in that statement, as they serve niches that AAAs simply do not. Take stealth gaming, for example, which received something truly exciting just a few days back: Intravenous 2: Mercenarism.


Those of us who have been eagerly anticipating when on earth might Ubisoft finally announce a new Splinter Cell game may have missed the memo about Intravenous and its upcoming sequel, Intravenous 2. The mostly unknown stealth shooter from the developer HypeTrain Digital enjoys solid reviews, but it&#x27;s the 2024 sequel that&#x27;s really interesting here, mainly because it&#x27;s got a top-tier demo you could start playing right this instant.

                              <span>Nintendo&#x27;s battle royale F-Zero 99 has been around the block for a few months now, but it&#x27;s still seeing steady updates. As of the 1.2.0 update that went live on January 24, F-Zero 99 now includes an easier way to play with friends alongside a little surprise for more dedicated players.


The big feature of this update is the Private Lobby. This feature works exactly the way it sounds; any player who has completed the tutorial can now create or join their own private room right from the main menu. Simply select a game mode, enter a passcode, and you&#x27;re in. 


Your room will auto-populate with CPU players once the countdown timer ends, so you don&#x27;t actually need 99 people to make this feature work. Heck, if you just want to race by yourself against bots, you can do that here.




But what are the secret tracks in F-Zero 99?


The much more enigmatic addition via this patch is the addition of &quot;secret tracks.&quot; So far, it appears that tracks titled &quot;???&quot; will randomly appear as you play online, complete with glitched-looking level icons. The tracks themselves seem to be mash-ups of existing tracks, with similarly mashed-up music to accompany them. Completing one of these will give you the &quot;???&quot; badge.




If you play enough, you should see one of these courses pop up sooner than later. As of writing, we&#x27;re still learning more about how what each of these easter egg tracks looks like.


Additionally, update 1.2.0 also increases the max level cap to 399 (with numbers over 100 being marked with stars), and a new maximum skill rating of S50. Also, most importantly, the patch notes for this update state that Nintendo has &quot;Fixed issues to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.&quot; Thanks for looking out for the pleasantness of my gaming experience, it means a lot!


F-Zero 99 is available now as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service.

The layoffs affect almost 9% of the 22,000 employees at the company. In a memo to staff, Microsoft Gaming CEO claims the layoffs come after leadership at Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard identified areas of overlap following the recent acquisition of Activision, Blizzard, and King.


Here is the full memo Phil Spencer sent to staff:



It’s been a little over three months since the Activision, Blizzard, and King teams joined Microsoft. As we move forward in 2024, the leadership of Microsoft Gaming and Activision Blizzard is committed to aligning on a strategy and an execution plan with a sustainable cost structure that will support the whole of our growing bus…</span>

A deck-builder that uses a real deck of cards? Colour us surprised. But Balatro, from developer LocalThunk, does just that.
Launching on Nintendo Switch on 20th February, Balatro throws all other fantasy decks out of the window and has settled on the good ol&#x27; deck of 52 for its roguelike deck-building shenanigans. Yet, despite the psychedelic, fuzzy pixel art visuals, your goal is simple — win at poker using the most underhand, illegal tactics possible.

Four employees have reportedly been dismissed from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam following The Pokémon X Van Gogh exhibition.
In a report from Dutch newspaper Het Parool (via Eurogramer), at least four employees were suspended from the museum &quot;due to their behavior&quot;. While the museum itself has refused to confirm numbers, sources close to the newspaper have stated that four people were suspended. Among these are security guards and public service employees.

Nintendo of America&#x27;s first big 2024 sale kicks off today, and we&#x27;re getting a Jump-start to January.
Multiple big first-party titles are included in this suit of discounts along with some big-name third-party games — even some 2023 gems have been given a little discount, so if there&#x27;s something you were on the fence about last year, now might be the time to spend those dollars. The sale is on from today, 25th January to 7th February 2024 at 11:59pm PT.

                              <span>Coming to Switch in March.
Berserk Boy has finally been given a release date on Switch. Developed and published by BerserkBoy Games, the upcoming pixel art action platformer will be blasting onto our Switch screens on 6th March 2024 (thanks Time Extension!).
A release date trailer was published by IGN earlier today and showcases some beautiful animated cutscenes and fast-paced run-and-gun gameplay. Inspired by classic 8- and 16-bit platformers, particularly Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog, it&#x27;s all about moving fast and blasting your way through hordes of robotic enemies and levels.

                              <span>You could say it&#x27;s an Adept.
Soapbox features enable our individual writers and contributors to voice their opinions on hot topics and random stuff they&#x27;ve been chewing over. Today, Alana reflects on playing Golden Sun in 2024, and how it allows players to figure things out for themselves rather than relying on tutorials. Warning — minor early game spoilers ahead...

Golden Sun is good – really good. That&#x27;s not surprising at all to most people, but to me, someone who played it back when it first launched 23 years ago and bounced off of it, it&#x27;s a bit of a relief.

                              <span>Adventure mode was one of my favourite things about Dwarf Fortress, mainly because it made the infamously complex management game more approachable by letting you play it like a more traditional roguelike. I&#x27;m excited, therefore, that Adventure mode is coming soon to the Steam version of the game, and excited even more so that it&#x27;s aiming to make it even more accessible.

A new update on development which outlines exactly how the new premium version of Adventure mode differs from the original, including its plan for tutorials to guide new players.

You&#x27;ll find the announcement trailer below.

It returned last year for a seemingly final time, and today it has a new demo and a release date: March 6th, 2024.

Not much more was known about the game except that the studio were actively ramping up recruitment, seemingly after having been working on the project since 2017.

This survival game has now been cancelled alongside today&#x27;s news of sweeping layoffs across Blizzard and other divisions of new owner Microsoft.

                              <span>When I sat down at my desk after lunch today, I thought, I&#x27;m just going to give this demo for Balatro a tiny go, just to get my head round its poker-based roguelike deckbuilding. Cut to several hours later and I&#x27;ve had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro&#x27;s demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you&#x27;re into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who&#x27;s never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let&#x27;s face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that&#x27;s turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it&#x27;s coming out in full real soon, too.

                              <span>Room for another mass layoff post, before we end the day? This one is actually two separate stories but in a bid to conserve resources and make our frontpage slightly less depressing to read, I am going to roll them together. Black Forest Games, the Embracer-owned creators of the Destroy All Humans! Remake, are reportedly cutting 50% of their workforce - around 50-60 people. Outriders developers People Can Fly, meanwhile, have laid off 30 developers who were working on an unannounced Square Enix game.

                              <span>Punch some trees, get some logs, build a crafting bench. I&#x27;m bored of Palworld already, because it starts off the same as any other survival game. Of course it does! Here I was hoping for something a bit different - a legally distinct Pinser welcoming me into his home of angry cicada-likes - and I get another serving of derivative. Am I wrong in wanting a survival game that doesn&#x27;t begin like the rest of them?

                              <span>We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast have our finger on the beating pulse of current events, which is why we&#x27;re going to talk about the accusations that are flying around Palworld, the new and extremely popular Pokémon-meets-Rust. Does it contain AI? Did it directly steal from Pokémon? Can The Pokémon Company sue? Probably not. But why does everyone care so damn much anyway? We give our vibes-based takes on the whole affair, which seems to be escalating every day (and will therefore presumably disappear soon).

                              <span>As far as bread goes, I&#x27;d say those unlimited top-ups you get with fancy meals can sometimes supersede the actual meal itself. A little swirl in olive oil and balsamic? Mwah, delicious. For a more regular transaction, I do love a multi-seeded loaf for the added texture. Now, would I say I like bread more than… anime? That&#x27;s tough. But thankfully I don&#x27;t need to decide, as there&#x27;s a demo of a game out right now that combines both interests. In Aeruta you play as an anime girl who defeats monsters and uses their innards to fuel her bakery business. Perfect.

                              <span>Given that Microsoft have spent considerable time and effort becoming the biggest cock-of-the-walk possible, it does, I suppose, make sense that their layoffs are correspondingly massive. In an internal memo obtained by The Verge, Phil Spencer is very sad to reveal to the staff that, in order to grow, the combined powers of Microsoft&#x27;s 22k-strong Gaming Division have to be denuded to the tune of 1,900 human beings. That amounts to about 8% of the division.

Super Algebrawl. This tactical mathematical RPG is the latest from Punkcake Délicieux, the small team behind the roguelikelike &#x27;chess with a gun&#x27; Shotgun King. Super Algebrawl started life as a experiment by one of the devs to help teach his daughter maths, though frankly I think it&#x27;ll teach her maths is cruel. This game and I have very different relationships with numbers.

                              <span>Who&#x27;d have thought toilet plungers would make for such good jumping assistants when it comes to propelling yourself over big, thorny brambles and angry animals? Well, clearly the trio of developers at Phoenix Blasters did, as their upcoming platformer Telmari puts them front and centre as its main form of traversal. Your titular tiny heroine can&#x27;t jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she&#x27;ll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem. I&#x27;ve been playing its Steam demo this morning, and while it&#x27;s a little rough around the edges, there&#x27;s definitely something here for those trained in the Super Meat Boy school of pixel perfect platforming.

                              <span>Friends, it is finally time for me to discourse unto you about my great love of balls. The roots of my enthusiasm go back to pinball machines - both the fancier, arcade variety that transmogrify into e.g. screaming robot skulls when you achieve a high-enough multiplier, and the crappy, play-at-home variety that are basically a canted wooden sheet with some numbers drawn on it. But it wasn&#x27;t till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. 


Initiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch&#x27;s Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.

Or at least, that&#x27;s what it sounds like they&#x27;re saying between the lines of a statement published a few hours ago, in which the Pokémon Company acknowledges messages sent by the concerned PokéFaithful about &quot;another company&#x27;s game released in January 2024&quot;.

                              <span>Graham remarked the other day about how strange it can be to see which indie megahits spawn waves of homages and which ones don&#x27;t, noting that Lucas Pope&#x27;s Papers, Please has surprisingly few immitators. His post reminded me of Pope&#x27;s other hit, Return Of The Obra Dinn. The closest we&#x27;ve come to a &quot;Dinn-like&quot; is probably 2022&#x27;s outstanding The Case Of The Golden Idol, though as I said in my review, its fill-in-the-blanks murder tableaus felt just about distinct enough to be their own separate thing. 
Happily, the &quot;Golden Idol-like&quot; appears to be having a bit of a moment of its own right now, as Playstack, the publishers of Golden Idol, have just announced the delightful-looking Little Problems, a detective game that turns its word-shuffling problem-solving to the altogether more relatable conundrums of everyday life. And I couldn&#x27;t be more here for it.

                              <span>While we are beginning to see AMD Zen 4C cores in client systems, these smaller cores have already proven themselves very interesting and capable with the AMD EPYC Bergamo high core count server processors and the extremely power efficient EPYC 8004 &quot;Siena&quot; processors. For showing how far Zen has come in power efficiency, I thought it would be fun to show how the original flagship EPYC 7601 &quot;Zen 1&quot; processor with 32-cores / 64-threads compared to Zen 4C with the EPYC 8324P(N) 32-core processors. But as that isn&#x27;t even the top-end Siena part, I also tossed in the 64-core EPYC 8534PN too for a top of stack look for the current EPYC 8004 line-up.</span>

Check out the archive of our stream below where we chat about the series, whether or not this is a good place to jump in, and just generally talk about what makes the game cool without spoiling any story elements.

I wrote Game Informer&#x27;s Skull and Bones cover story back in 2022, and have played the game several times since then in previews, betas, and more. 
Despite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience. Because I&#x27;ve played so many of its disparate parts rather than the whole, I believe there&#x27;s something really good in the game.

                              <span>Black Forest Games, the studio behind the recent Destroy All Humans! 1 and 2 remakes, has reportedly laid off about 50 people. This news comes from Kotaku, which learned from a source with knowledge of the situation that these layoffs were announced yesterday, January 24, and that more information about them would be provided next week. 
Game Informer has reached out to Black Forest Games and will update this story if it learns more. 


Kotaku writes that its source says creative directors and most, &quot;if not all,&quot; of the managers at Black Forest Games will keep their jobs following the layoffs. At approximately 110 employees as of last year, 50 job cuts would equate to a roughly 50 percent reduction in staff at the studio.

Today, we learned about the most recent instance of this – Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition is coming to PC on March 21. The news comes via the PlayStation Blog, where they revealed that both the base game and its 2023 expansion, Burning Shores, will come to the new platform as a package deal.

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Naughty Dog announced Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II would be coming to its recent release, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, in a post-launch update for the game. Now, we know exactly when this behind-the-scenes documentary will be live: February 2. 
Grounded II will be added to The Last of Us Part II Remastered in a free update for the game on February 2, but you can also watch the documentary on YouTube the same day. The documentary and associated game update will both go live at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet, check out the Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II trailer below: 


As you can see, Grounded II promises to dive into various behind-the-scenes aspects of Naughty Dog&#x27;s latest and arguably most controversial game. The trailer touches on studio crunch, leaks, and more. 
While waiting for Grounded II to go live next week, read Game Informer&#x27;s review of The Last of Us Part II, and then check out these first-time player impressions of The Last of Us Part II Remastered. After that, read my opinion piece about how HBO&#x27;s adaptation can fix the worst part of The Last of Us Part II, and then watch these two NGTs for The Last of Us Part II Remastered: Surviving the No Return Roguelite Mode and Checking Out The &quot;Lost Levels&quot; Cut Content.

The Verge obtained the full internal memo sent to staff by Microsoft&#x27;s game content and studios president, Matt Booty. In it, he says, following today&#x27;s layoffs, the company is moving forward with a more focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets it up for sustainable growth and a better alignment of talent. Booty also addresses Blizzard president Mike Ybarra&#x27;s departure, and the cancelation of its in-development survival game project. He says Blizzard&#x27;s next president will be announced next week.

&quot;Dead,&quot; Shamdasani writes on Twitter in response to someone asking what happened with the series&#x27; production. &quot;We took around a fantastic pilot script by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton along with a multi-season plan they built with our showrunners, but got rejected across the board. The size and scale needed to do it right proved too much for anyone to want to risk. Amazon came closest.&quot;

This news comes by way of Kotaku, which reports that its source with knowledge of the situation said the job cuts affected only staff working on an unannounced game at the studio, codenamed Project Gemini, that is to be published by Square Enix. 
Kotaku reached out to People Can Fly after its source sent screenshots confirming that layoffs happened at the studio, and development director Adam Alker confirmed the news. Alker cited budget limitations and a shrinking scope for Project Gemini as for why it was laying off &quot;over 30 people.&quot; The publication notes that another 20 outside of the 30 laid off were removed from the project and moved to other projects at People Can Fly.

                              <span>Earlier this evening, The Pokémon Company issued a press release seemingly addressing the recent conversation surrounding the new Steam Early Access release Palworld and its suspiciously familiar-looking collectible creatures. 
“We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024,” the company states. “We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”
While The Pokémon Company doesn’t explicitly name Palworld or its developer, Pocketpair, in its statement, we presume it’s investigating the record-setting Steam title based on the specified release window and recent controversies surrounding the game’s alleged infringement of Pokémon IP. 
“We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future,” the company states in closing.

By the time I saw the credits on Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, I felt like I had been through the emotional ringer. I was mentally exhausted. I think that&#x27;s by design. Infinite Wealth is developer Ryu Ga Gotoku&#x27;s (RGG) most ambitious project by a long shot – an epic tale told across multiple characters and continents, featuring the conclusion of some nearly 20-year-old plot threads that leave at least one character, quite literally and relatably, asleep in the streets. Some of this is the best work th…</span>

                              <span>Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. 
Reincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.
The shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.


In a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, 
Until service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix&#x27;s blog post. 
Former editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that &quot;Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has announced that it will stream full pre-recorded concerts for The Legend of Zelda series and its Splatoon franchise next month. Both concerts were set to be a part of Nintendo Live events in December of last year and this month, too, in Tokyo, Japan, but these events were canceled over safety concerns, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Now, everyone will be able to watch these concerts when they hit the official Nintendo YouTube channel next month. 
More specifically, The Legend of Zelda orchestra concert will go live on Friday, February 9, at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, and the Splatoon 3 Deep Cut concert will be posted on February 10.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3&#x27;s Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That&#x27;s when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it&#x27;s when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. 
Nintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. 
Check it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: 


For the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2&#x27;s Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go &quot;way back&quot; with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina&#x27;s co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. 
With the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It&#x27;s likely Agent 8&#x27;s colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we&#x27;ll have to wait until February 22 to find out. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass.

                              <span>Supermassive Games’ breakout horror game Until Dawn is apparently headed to PC, becoming the next previously PlayStation 4-exclusive title to make the leap as an enhanced re-release after the likes of Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War and The Last of Us.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that asymmetrical outfits are better than playing on an old patch. As a seasoned Destiny fashionista, I can respect this decision. However, as a fan of mods, I should point out that in many games, being forced onto a new patch might break compatability with a mod which added hundreds of pieces of stunning asymmetrical couture, and the developer hasn&#x27;t updated in years, and might never again. We continue. This week, I ask you to choose between two ways to picking your own level of challenge. What&#x27;s better: different puzzles on different difficulty levels, or bullet grazing?

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s entry-level Ryzen 7000 processor, the Ryzen 5 7600X, is down to $199. That&#x27;s $100 below the original launch price of the chip and the exact same price as the slightly slower but otherwise identical Ryzen 5 7600. (It&#x27;s even cheaper than Intel&#x27;s $204 Core i5 13400F, a chip that the 7600X beats convincingly in most games.) 
In the UK, it&#x27;s the 7600 that&#x27;s the better deal, at £189 versus the 7600X at £209, but both are fine value options too.

                              <span>Roots Of Yggdrasil - an inkwashed, roguelikey, card-playing, turn-based citybuilder, inspired by Norse myth - shot to the top of my wishlist after I read Katharine&#x27;s preview last week. And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn&#x27;t one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it&#x27;s a game about being on the run. 


In Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you&#x27;ll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

Educate me, wrestling fans.
Valheim isn&#x27;t waving a folding chair or a small flight of stairs, mind you. It&#x27;s holding a development diary for the forthcoming Ashlands update, due sometime in the first half of 2024. The update introduces the titular Ashlands biome, a blend of graveyard and volcano level notable for the presence of burning skellingtons, some of whom emerge from glowering stone totems.

                              <span>Before Doom became the lean, mean murdermachine we know and love, Id Software had far bigger plans for their seminal satanic FPS. Ideas dropped during development include a big focus on story, four playable characters, elemental shields, demonic weapons, and more. The mod Doom Delta brings to life many such ideas from sources including an old design document and leaked alpha builds, which I think makes it fanfic? A new version of Doom Delta launched last week, offering a curious vision of the many Dooms Id didn&#x27;t make.

Case in point: over the weekend, it was discovered that humans, in addition to Pals, could also be stuffed into balls and set to work in your base camp, but now they&#x27;ve only gone and started capturing the in-game bosses, too, thanks to a surprisingly easy-to-achieve exploit involving my bestest of friends, the island police force.

Bizarrely, they also believe they &quot;implemented everything shown in the trailers&quot;. Riiight.

                              <span>I realised several hours into my Enshrouded playthrough that I have an unspoken internal checklist for what makes a great open-world survival crafting game. Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it&#x27;s digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it&#x27;s getting crushed by the very tree you&#x27;d just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.
One paragraph in, and I&#x27;ve already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You&#x27;ll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that&#x27;s both an accolade and a reservation. Because it&#x27;s not quite there... yet.

                              <span>As much as I love looking at and admiring sandbox citybuilders like Townscaper, I am terrible at actually playing them. I get the same kind of blank canvas choice paralysis I do in games like Minecraft, or anything where there&#x27;s no real clear objective for what I&#x27;m meant to be building. I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination. But Summerhouse, the sandbox citybuilder (or townbuilder, more like) from solo developer Friedemann is just teeny-tiny enough to give me a sense of creative satisfaction. I&#x27;ve been playing its gorgeous little demo this week in between Palworld sessions, and yes, more of this please, this is utterly delightful. Happily, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the final game now either, as it&#x27;s coming to Steam on March 8th.

He recently Xeeted about the studio&#x27;s upcoming projects C and D, described as &quot;next level FMV, hold onto your seats&quot;, and &quot;reinventing 3rd person horror again&quot;, respectively. The games now have heavily redacted Steam pages, and Barlow revealed a few more details on Kinda Funny Games (helpfully transcribed a bit by VGC if you can&#x27;t be arsed watching).

The monster-catching survival sim continues to set concurrent play records on Steam, and Pocketpair are presently focussed on fixing bugs. Beyond that, though, the sky appears to be the limit, as you might expect of a game that shifted a million copies in eight hours. In particular, Pocketpair seem markedly more confident about the odds of adding PvP to the game, having downplayed the idea in interviews before release.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 will crashdown on our planet&#x27;s surface on February 8th, 2024, and turns the topdown co-op alien shooter into a flashier, fancier third-person version of the same. A new trailer release today details how its &#x27;Galactic War&#x27; systems work - that is, the macro-scale conflict within which your missions and bug hunts take place.

                              <span>Some indie hits create a legion of copycats, but others, not so much. I don&#x27;t think there are too many Papers, Pleaselikes, for example - perhaps for obvious reasons given that game&#x27;s grim subject matter.

Lil&#x27; Guardsman is a Papers, Pleaselike though - and a seemingly delightful one. You play as 12-year-old Lil, who is a substitute guard at the castle gate for a fantasy kigndom, and you must decide who to admit and who to deny entry. It&#x27;s out now.

It took that spot from Counter-Strike 2 and the only game to reach higher is now PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds, aka Plunkbat, aka PUBG.

                              <span>420mm AiOs are quite rare - not many cases come with space for three 140mm fans in a row - but they&#x27;re the biggest size of consumer radiators currently available and offer unmatched cooling potential. Therefore, it may be of interest to you to learn that the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 is down to just £79 at Amazon UK, a crazy-low price for a cooler of this size and prowess.

                              <span>Dear reader, are you - like everyone else I know - keen to build a small form factor PC? If so, you&#x27;ll probably want a Mini ITX AM5 motherboard, and this one from Asus is one of the very best available: the Asus ROG Strix B650E-I Gaming WiFi. It cost £329.99 last year, but now it&#x27;s on sale from Amazon UK for just £239.99 - a £90 savings and still £30 cheaper than Asus&#x27; official web store.

                              <span>Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off &quot;about 530&quot; people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to &quot;create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future&quot;, in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The &quot;biggest impact&quot; will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot&#x27;s own intellectual properties.

I&#x27;m currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They&#x27;re just candles of lies.

Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don&#x27;t have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren&#x27;t having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re in need of some quiet time - and I certainly am, because the people upstairs are having their kitchen refitted, and the resulting powerdrill noise is literally shaking things off my desk - I recommend a stroll across the plains of Planetside 2. This might seem odd advice, given that PlanetSide 2 is a shooter in which hundreds or even thousands of players fight each other simultaneously, but the thing about planet-sized wars is that they require plenty of legroom, and the thing about crowds is that you can lose yourself within them.

                              <span>Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it&#x27;s refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.
But. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word &quot;Mayan&quot; does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say &quot;the Yucatán peninsula&quot;, and sometimes &quot;the mystical land of Jukatan&quot;, which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn&#x27;t make me less sus. I&#x27;ve hedged my bets by saying &quot;Mayan-ish&quot; - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...

Seeing as you voted the seminal immersive sim your seventh-favourite RPG of all time, I thought you might like to see it too. It&#x27;s very good.

                              <span>I try to be open minded, you know. What usually happens is I give an adventure game a chance though they&#x27;re all terrible (all of them), and I try. I really do. I made it several hours into Stasis Colon Bone Totem before getting frustra-bored and giving up. That may sound damning, but it&#x27;s actually very good indeed, because usually that happens within about ten minutes. I can&#x27;t say it defied my hatred of the genre as much as a The Last Express or The Cat Lady, but it had a good enough run to deserve talking about. Not least as I&#x27;m still curious about its setting.

                              <span>Ahhh, fast travel: the opinion generator. Speaking to IGN, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 director Hideaki Itsuno threw his own hat into the ring, saying that he&#x27;s keen to avoid fast travel in DD2 and would prefer that &quot;players travel normally and experience the world around them&quot;. If you&#x27;re someone who argues all games should let you teleport to the objective, then Itsuno thinks you&#x27;re wrong. Hey, he doesn&#x27;t mess about, and I don&#x27;t disagree with him, as long as the game isn&#x27;t actually wasting my time.

                              <span>Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a brilliant foray into turn-based chaos, but some of its RPG elements didn&#x27;t quite lead anywhere. Well, in swaggers the frankly ginormous Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth to tie off the loose ends and give us a follow-up that links all the best bits of Yakuza into a far more satisfying reward loop. Some of the refinements make for superb silliness, while others are a bit eh - not everything is perfect. But spending time with Ichiban and his pals in the sun-soaked Hawaii and beyond is the real treat. It&#x27;s a wonderful, happy JRPG and it will never fail to brighten my day. Thank goodness for Yakuza.

                              <span>For such a ma-bloody-hoosive RPG, it turns out Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can fit rather snugly in the diminutive Steam Deck. Developers RGG Studio revealed, a full two weeks before launch, that Valve had awarded it coveted Verified status – a mark of honour for games that run, control, and generally operate well on the handheld.
What that golden sticker doesn’t explain is that to keep above a suitable 30fps, Infinite Wealth does demand that you swing the stolen bicycle of quality reductions directly into the soft skull of its graphical settings. It’s perfectly doable, mind, so if LADding around Hawaii sounds like as much fun to you as Ed’s review makes it seem, read on to find out how Infinite Wealth gets on with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.

                              <span>When I am faced with Death, and that grim skeletal mouth asks me to choose the game we play to decide my fate, I have long believed I will pick Tekken. I&#x27;m not confident I will best the reaper in Iron Fist combat. But I cannot pass up the adrenally depraved possibility of successfully performing a ten-button airborne combo on mortality made manifest. It would be rad. It would be absurd and beautiful and I know, for a fact, that Death will play as Panda. 
But will we play Tekken 8? Or roll back to Tekken 7? Hmmm. Let&#x27;s find out.

                              <span>Obsidian&#x27;s Avowed is a game for the more indecisive or changeable RPG player, with no &quot;enforced&quot; classes and an emphasis on easily respeccing and experimenting with different combinations of weapons and abilities. Or at least, that&#x27;s my overall takeaway from a new Xbox podcast interview featuring game director Carrie Patel and gameplay director Gabe Paramo. In the video, the pair delve a little deeper into last week&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct showcase and how the game compares to their previous Pillars of Eternity games, which are set in the same world.

Last night, I reached a part of the game&#x27;s Technology tree that sent an actual shiver down my spine, it was that awful and morbid.

                              <span>Half Mermaid, led by Sam Barlow, is known for making video games using FMV, and they often require the player to sort through footage to solve mysteries. But for the studio&#x27;s next projects, it seems the mystery will begin before the games are even announced – today, two Steam listings were posted on Half Mermaid&#x27;s developer page, but most of their information is redacted.
The games, currently called &quot;Project C&quot; and &quot;Project D,&quot; have very few concrete details listed. White text blocks give the page a redacted look, so only a few words in each sentence are legible, and the images and videos in their galleries are surreal and vague. Obscure details are still details, however, so here&#x27;s a breakdown of what we know about each game so far.

Dubbed Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete, this expanded version of the 2005 CG film is 26 minutes longer than the original. Square Enix states it features “roughly a thousand revised scenes with expanded themes and improved visuals.”

                              <span>Blake Hester is hard at work on Game Informer’s full review of the exceptionally long Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but while he is gathering his final thoughts, I wanted to share my impressions so far.
Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth can be deathly serious when it wants to be. A character with a negative first encounter with the game’s protagonist, Ichiban, soon reveals he is in over his head with the local Yakuza and spent time in jail, leading to heartbreaking difficulties with his significant other. Ichiban is sympathetic and builds him up with his unique and often excessive brand of optimism. The moment is well-written and genuinely moving. Those moments (at least in the first 11 hours) are rare and hit hard as a result.

Fittingly, these new Joy-Con are pastel pink, just like Peach&#x27;s signature dress. They will be available for purchase at select retailers and Nintendo&#x27;s online store for a limited time, although Nintendo did not mention exactly when players can buy them. 
And speaking of Princess Peach: Showtime, in the latest gameplay trailer for it released today, we get a glimpse at several new iterations of the titular character, including Ninja Peach, Cowgirl Peach, and Kung-Fu Peach, as well as new looks at others like Patissiere Peach, Detective Peach, and Swordfighter Peach. 
Check them out for yourself in the new Princess Peach: Showtime gameplay trailer below:

                              <span>Listen up: this is one of the simplest and most effective upgrades you can give your mechanical keyboard, and right now it&#x27;s 50% off, just $12. 
I&#x27;m talking about a full set of 104 double-shot PBT pudding keycaps from HyperX, which combine the excellent legibility of a black backlit keycap tops with frosted semi-transparent sides. This is the perfect pairing for RGB wave fanatics, but it looks just as nice with a tastefully chosen single-colour or other effects. I am a huge fan of these keycaps, and at $12 they&#x27;re an almost essential purchase for mechanical keyboard owners.

                              <span>Double-wide 32:9 gaming monitors are becoming increasingly affordable, which is brilliant for anyone that prefers an ultra-wide aspect ratio but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with the relatively limited desktop real estate of your standard 21:9 ultrawide. 
Right now you can pick up LG&#x27;s 45-inch 45GR65DC, which essentially combines two 24-inch 1440p 200Hz screens into a single titanic panel, for just $550 - rather than the usual $700. That $150 discount turns this into a great alternative to a traditional two monitor setup, letting you have tons of space for getting work done as well as a super-immersive ultrawide gaming experience - just lovely.

Nvidia&#x27;s RTX Remix tech lets people fancify old games by injecting fancy modern lighting, new models, textures &#x27;remastered&#x27; by AI, new environmental decoration, and other such fanciness, even if the game doesn&#x27;t have mod support. I&#x27;ll be curious to see what people make with this, though I am wary of artlessly pumping new tech into old games.

                              <span>Pocketpair&#x27;s monster-collecting survival game Palworld has rekindled the eternal debate over what exactly constitutes a breach of copyright. While the game&#x27;s mechanics are more reminiscent of Ark: Survival Evolved and other tree-punching, template-arranging wilderness sims, its monsters owe obvious debts to Nintendo and Game Freaks&#x27; Pokémon games. 
The developers have something of a track record on this front, with their older early access release Craftopia freely stirring in nods to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But what separates copyright infringement from a flagrant, but perfectly legal rip-off? Given that a lot of people are making the case for Palworld being copyright theft online, I thought it might be useful to seek insight from (ominous roll of thunder) an actual lawyer.

Each member of the RPS Treehouse is getting involved this year as well, so read on below to find out what&#x27;s on the Club docket.

                              <span>The next Cyberpunk game from CD Projekt - currently codenamed &quot;Orion&quot; - might have multiplayer in it, according to co-CEO Michal Nowakowski. Please let it be some kind of deckhead &#x27;passenger-seat-driver&#x27; mode, where you get to play a crusty celeb uploaded to another character&#x27;s brain implants, who strolls around the landscape as a hologram, offering passive-aggressive commentary. Watch those corners, samurai! Hey, you missed an ammo pack. SAMURAI ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME.
It&#x27;ll be a while till we find out for sure: Orion is still in the conceptual phase, with CD Projekt expecting to have about 80 people working on it by the end of this year. The higher priority in 2024, it seems, is the next big steaming helping of The Witcher.

Piranha Bytes, who are one of well over a hundred studios that Embracer bought up in recent years, today posted a statement on Xitter saying &quot;Don&#x27;t write us off yet!&quot;. The statement goes on to say that they&#x27;re &quot;convinced they will succeed&quot;. Succeed at what, you might ask? Not being shut down by Embracer.

                              <span>For a series that&#x27;s defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom&#x27;s beloved lawyer &#x27;em up. Except poor old Apollo isn&#x27;t really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still the series&#x27; original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo&#x27;s debut game rolls its credits. What&#x27;s more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.
The result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom&#x27;s first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series&#x27; best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye was caught by dozens upon dozens of spam accounts hijacking the tag to promote cryptocurrency garbage. Twitter&#x27;s journey to uselessness continues. But after reporting dozens of accounts in the vain hope that Twitter might at least knock these particular bots offline (knowing it&#x27;ll never actually address the wider problem), I was delighted to admire a great many attractive and interesting indie games. Check out this week&#x27;s pick!

                              <span>“Most of videogame history is alive and well due to the ability to pirate old video games,” Frank Cifaldi, founder of the Video Game History Foundation, tells me over a call. Last year, the preservation and archival non-profit put out a study revealing that 87% of games made before 2010 are out of print. “There&#x27;s no way to access them without either pirating them or buying antiques from vendors. That&#x27;s a scary place to be.”

                              <span>When Edwin popped the reveal trailer for new Metroidvania Deviator into The Maw this morning, he really wasn&#x27;t kidding about it looking a heck of a lot like Hollow Knight. You&#x27;ve got a small, diminutive hero with a nasty little blade up his sleeve, a haunting and melancholy piano score, a beautiful hand-drawn animation style, and lots of mean-looking creatures to fight. Then again, the trailer also makes it clear there are lots and lots of spikes and traps to navigate here, which puts me more in the mind of Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Either way, I&#x27;m well up for another platforming-Metroidy hybrid, and developers Gami Studio have announced that there&#x27;s Steam demo coming in February.

                              <span>When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it&#x27;s among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it&#x27;s doing almost twice the numbers of Steam&#x27;s usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo&#x27;s monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck beta client update is out, and it’s made a pretty neat addition to the quick-access performance menu. A tap of the Y button now brings up a brief explainer for whichever individual setting is currently highlighted, a handy lil’ reference for anyone who wants to customise how their Deck (or Steam Deck OLED) runs without knowing exactly how things like TDP limits and half-rate shading affect performance. Clearly it’s also a brutal attack on the livelihoods of honest hardware editors who write guides to this sort of thing, but whatever, Valve.

                              <span>Developer Rocksteady Studios has pulled back the curtains on the free seasonal content coming to Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League after the game&#x27;s launch on February 2. Season 1 will kick off in March and includes the most famous villain in the DC roster: The Joker. Not only is The Joker joining the game, but he&#x27;ll be a new playable member of the Suicide Squad. 
Notably, this take on The Joker is not the Mark Hamill-voiced character from the Batman: Arkham series. Instead, Brainiac is pulling Elseworlds together in an attempt to merge them into a unified multiverse. This is how The Joker in Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League joins the roster. In his universe, he was already a member of the Suicide Squad. His playstyle is fast and dynamic and requires players to stay moving, accor…</span>

                              <span>Palworld first captured the attention of gamers (and their internet sphere) when it was revealed back in 2021. While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it&#x27;s smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. 
Following various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely&#x27;s Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…</span>

Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He&#x27;s second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there&#x27;s not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo&#x27;s courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.
The collection includes three games: Apollo …</span>

                              <span>Last week, the internet began to speculate that Gothic and Elex II developer Piranha Bytes was being shut down after fans noticed the studio&#x27;s website was essentially defunct. Many speculated Piranha Bytes was another casualty in owner Embracer Group&#x27;s purge of studios that began last year after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.


Studio closures at the hands of Embracer include Saints Row developer Volition Games and reformed TeamSplitters team Free Radical Design. Game Informer reached out to Piranha Bytes following last week&#x27;s speculation to see if it was, indeed, another closure at the hands of Embracer, and today, studio CEO Michael Rüve responded, stating the studio&#x27;s situation right now is difficult but that people shouldn&#x27;t w…</span>

                              <span>During the full Xbox Developer Direct, we saw glimpses of the offices of developer MachineGames. As spotted by eagle-eyed viewers, there was a shot of a whiteboard at one point that appeared to have a Quake logo drawn on it underneath writing that seems to say &quot;Quake 6.&quot;

In an interview with Lucasfilm.com, game director Jerk Gustafsson said first-person was &quot;part of MachineGames&#x27; DNA&quot;, and that the perspective &quot;separates our game from many other action-adventure titles.&quot;

                              <span>After saying last weekend that I was aching for the cruelty of snow, I found it. When weather warnings popped up this week, I tracked forecasts and cloud movements for hours before booking a day off work to chase potential snow. When I woke up, it looked bad. Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really.

Sure, that old Phillips screwdriver your dad gave you does the job most of the time, but wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to put it somewhere safe and get something a little more adaptable? 
Walmart are doing a good deal on a Hyper Tough 77-piece screwdriver set, which is $10 versus its regular $16 - a good deal for a set that includes everything you&#x27;d need for PC building and maintenance and has attracted a 4.5/5.0 star average after 245 reviews.

                              <span>Earlier this week I reported on a great deal for the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240, a 240mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon US. Today I&#x27;m back with a confusingly similar deal: an all-time low price on the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280, a 280mm AiO with excellent reviews, over on Amazon UK. It&#x27;s down to £70 following a 26% reduction, a great price for an AiO that regularly beats less powerful 360mm alternatives.

                              <span>Russian telecoms watchdog Roskomnadzor is reporting a huge increase in the amount of infringing content it either blocked or deleted in 2023. The finger of blame for the 100%+ uplift over figures reported in 2022 can be found pointing towards Western companies no longer operating in the Russian market, but still producing desirable content. According to the head of a local anti-piracy company, Western companies have &#x27;legalized&#x27; piracy in Russia.

                              <span>Game Informer asked Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&#x27;s game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, 129 rapid-fire questions about the party&#x27;s next adventure while visiting Creative Business Unit I during our recent cover story trip in Tokyo. During our chat, we inquired about the original Final Fantasy 7&#x27;s rumored N64 version, Zack&#x27;s importance in the remake, whether mainline entries will ever return to Nintendo consoles, and 126 other burning questions. Oh, and we also try to guess the next game&#x27;s subtitle. My money is on &quot;Reloaded.&quot;

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved. Archived episodes will be uploaded each Saturday on our second YouTube channel Game Informer Shows, which you can watch both above and by clicking the links below.

                              <span>After years of excitement and skeptism, the Pokémon-like survival game Palworld is now available in early access. The game drops player into a collection of tropical islands inhabited by monsters called Pals that you can catch as your own. Pals can be used in battle or put to work, building structures and mining resources. You can also mow them down with guns. Yes, this game features realistic guns. It&#x27;s a very strange but, thus far, entertaining experience.
Watch Marcus Stewart and Alex Van Aken dive into the Xbox version of Palworld from the beginning to see how the game performs in its first incarnation. For more on Palworld, check out our recent feature in which we spoke to developer Pocketpair about the studios&#x27; origins and Palworld&#x27;s creation and features.

                              <span>Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. 
Although Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn&#x27;t make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. 


Ed joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too. For more, check out Game Informer&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 review and see where it ranked in our Top 10 Games of 2023.</span>

                              <span>Last Epoch is gunning for the action-RPG crown long held by Diablo (and recently contested by the likes of Path of Exile and Grim Dawn). With the power of time travel - and a flash-looking launch trailer - on its side, the indie hopeful certainly looks set to put up a decent fight when it exits Early Access in just over a month.

                              <span>For a game that&#x27;s been repeatedly described as &quot;Pokémon with machineguns&quot;, the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn&#x27;t already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you&#x27;ll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. 
For underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak&#x27;s catch &#x27;em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can&#x27;t-believe-Nintendo&#x27;s-lawyers-haven&#x27;t-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that&#x27;s not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it&#x27;s a Pokémon game on PC you&#x27;re after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this.

                              <span>Palworld was obviously destined for success the moment a million games journalists and Twitter users wrote “Pokémon with machine guns”. (Acceptable alternate nicknames include “Eevees with uzis” and “Abras who’ll stab-ya”.) Having finally launched into Early Access on Steam and Game Pass this week, that prophecy has rung true as the monster-catching survival game has caught (ha, ha) so many players that its servers are struggling to handle the load.

                              <span>It always breaks my heart a bit when a game I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a while absolutely biffs it on arrival. Having quite enjoyed Golf Club Wasteland a few years ago (now called Golf Club Nostalgia for, I don&#x27;t know, reasons), I was quite pumped when developers Demagog Studios announced not one, but two further games set in the same post-apocalyptic universe. The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it&#x27;s the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. 
I&#x27;ve been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it&#x27;s trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all. I was looking forward to any excuse I could get to have the soothing sounds of Golf Club&#x27;s dystopian Radio Nostalgia From Mars show back in my ear drums, but alas. I simply cannot hear it over the sound of my own screams of frustration.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve known about Moonlighter devs&#x27; upcoming RTS tower defence hybrid Cataclismo for a little while now. But now we know a couple more things. It&#x27;s set to release in Q2 of this year, and there&#x27;s a demo on Steam right now if you&#x27;d like to give it a try. Expect to make nice fortresses out of Lego-style bricks, then defend them from hordes of horrors. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a recipe for a good time.

Even as a keen viewer of Leverage: Redemption, I was leery of the heist-o-rama tackling esports. And sure, its fake video game is baffling, but I was surprised by how many notes the esports episode hit right. With an Illumatrons team overworked to breaking point by an egotistical owner hawking dangerous supplements, it&#x27;ll take a con, a frame, fisticuffs, and powerful cheat software to save the day.

                              <span>I disliked turn-based RPG Kingsvein at first. Quite a bit, in fact. An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I&#x27;ve since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.
It could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it&#x27;s grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it&#x27;s an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.

                              <span>The phrase &quot;best foot forwards&quot; implies the second foot will never be as good as the first, and that&#x27;s unfortunately the case with Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned For Danger. It has a 10/10 pun name and introduces/strengthens concepts that I expect will become series mainstays as we continue with this project, but this is definitely in &quot;difficult second album&quot; territory. I don&#x27;t hate it! But it&#x27;s no Secrets Can Kill, and I think that&#x27;s in part down to increased ambition, as our Nance is called upon to solve a poison pen puzzle at a TV studio.

                              <span>Last summer, Sky TV obtained a somewhat mysterious pirate IPTV blocking injunction at the High Court in London. In the months up to November 2023, that led to UK ISPs blocking at least 400 IPTV domains/subdomains, potentially many more. Available data today suggests a perpetual war of attrition on an unprecedented scale. In the last four weeks alone, Sky blocked almost 4,200 IPTV service URLs; the pirates&#x27; response is simple: churn out more.

While that could act as a deterrent, the shadow library remains online today. Hoping to make it less accessible, publishers are now turning to Google, which has received millions of takedown notices for the site&#x27;s domain names.

                              <span>The revival of this long-dormant franchise moves into the gear-and-power-gated family of games colloquially termed Metroidvanias, thanks to its similarity to early classics like Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. 
The Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics. While not everything on this list is brand new, these features combine to make Ubisoft’s new adventure one of the most rewarding, approachable, and satisfying releases in the genre, …</span>

                              <span>Whether you call them Metroid-likes, exploration-based action platformers, big map adventures, or simply Metroidvanias, this sub-genre has exploded in popularity. What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity. Here are 10 great modern Metroidvanias, in reverse chronological release order, that you’ll have a great time getting lost in.

We also learned that it’s launching later this year. EW.com also confirmed that though Harrison Ford&#x27;s likeness will appear in the game, he will be performed by Troy Baker (The Last of Us, Bioshock Infinite).
The adventure is called Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and stars Indy in his prime doing what he does best: solve puzzles, explore tombs, and pummel Nazis. Set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, Indy is chasing a stolen relic to solve an ancient, globe-trotting mystery. 
Like Machine Games’ modern Wolfenstein games, The Great Circle is a first-person experience. Expect to engage in shootouts and fist fights in…</span>

                              <span>Today, during the most recent Xbox Developer Direct, Ara: History Untold, a new strategy game from Oxide Games, got a deep dive revealing gameplay and more. The game was first announced in 2022. 
Oxide talked up its &quot;living world,&quot; a procedurally generated map for players to create the society they want in Ara. As the developers say, it will change over time based on players&#x27; decisions. You can watch the presentation starting at the 25:00 minute mark. 


Ara&#x27;s Prestige System pits players to build a nation better than opponents&#x27;. The game&#x27;s score system awards points based on what kind of leader a specific player wants to be. An example, as detailed during today&#x27;s live stream, is building &quot;Triumphs,&quot; or famous buildings throughout history that give large Prestige bonuses.
Oxide is a Maryland-based studio founded in 2013 by former Firaxis developers. Its previous games include 2016&#x27;s Ashes of the Singularity and Star Swarm. 
Ara: History Untold is expected to be released on PC and PC Game Pass in the fall of this year. However, Oxide plans to keep its &quot;Insider Program&quot; after release, implementing player feedback.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct, Square Enix made a surprise appearance to pull back the curtains on Visions of Mana, the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.
Executive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise&#x27;s history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. 


Mana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. 
Notably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix&#x27;s excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. 
Visions of Mana&#x27;s combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it&#x27;s due out sometime this summer. 

While waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month.

Unlike the isometric styling of those titles, Avowed is a first-person adventure more in the vein of something like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or The Outer Worlds.
Today’s Xbox Developer Direct offered a deeper dive into several important aspects of the game, but the standout feature was an explanation of combat, which aims to be action-oriented but still tactically complex. Players are allowed to use customizable loadouts, including selecting different weapons or other tools for each hand. We saw combinations of swords, shields, wands, and spell usage, and pistols.

                              <span>Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.
The developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge&#x27;s Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.


There are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.
Combat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.
Ninja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to &quot;craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.&quot; We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.</span>

                              <span>Last year was a fantastic year for games, with standout triple-A releases like Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, and great independent games like Jusant, Sea of Stars, and countless others. But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. 
Now, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report. Its data was collected from 3000 developers surveyed back in October of last year…</span>

                              <span>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now available, and if you’re a fan of games like Metroid, Castlevania, or Hollow Knight, and you don’t have it on your radar, that’s probably a mistake. The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story. If you want to prove your mastery of The Lost Crown, it’s the sequence you’ll want to tackle.

The publication says its sources pointed to laid-off staff posting about the job cuts on LinkedIn, but has since received confirmation from CI Games.
It&#x27;s currently unclear how many people 10 percent of the company translates, too, considering CI Games is a publisher that also owns studios like Lords of the Fallen developer Hexworks and Sniper Ghost Warrior developer Underdog Studio.

The publication says those with knowledge of the situation at the studio said the layoffs only affected people at Behaviour&#x27;s Montreal, Canada studio, with those 45 affected let go last week, between January 9 and 11. 
However, Kotaku notes it was also told layoffs at the company began in December. The layoffs reportedly included cuts in various departments at the studio. Last month, Behaviour Interactive announced it was working with Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games on The Casting of Frank Stone, a new single player game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.

                              <span>Another Code: Recollection is perhaps the best kind of remake. It takes two well-liked yet obscure graphic puzzle adventures in 2005&#x27;s Trace Memory for DS, and 2009&#x27;s Another Code: R - Journey Into Lost Memories for Wii (which never launched in the U.S.) and gives them a graphical and mechanical overhaul to make them readily available to a new audience.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off Recollection&#x27;s improvements and additions compared to the originals and discuss why you may not want to sleep on these adventures this time around.

                              <span>A poor test subject is doomed to repeat an hour over and over again. Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.
The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn&#x27;t have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn&#x27;t do properly.
Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game&#x27;s logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.
Now, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.
