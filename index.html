It’s a community wiki of every feature in the game from your races and side effects to gameplay mechanics. Here’s the official Project Trigger Trello and Discord.


Project Trigger Trello and Discord Guide


Image via Project Trigger!


Here are all the community hubs you’ll need for Project Trigger:



Official Project Trigger Trello Board


Project Trigger Discord Server


Project Trigger Community Page


Roblox Game Page



I highly recommend checking out the Trello board first as a beginner because it almost acts as a starter guide. It explains the important opening mechanics like how to get your started Trigger and then dives into the details of all features. You can find info on:



Basic mechanics and tips


All Trion colors


All Races and their stats


All side effects


All stats and details


All attachments


All quests and NPCs


All enemies sorted by rank


All gun hitboxes


All armor



The list goes on but it’s just an objective and wiki-like way to have a categorized overview of everything. That said, if you need more specific or subjective information from experienced Project Trigger players, then check out the Discord server. It’s where you can ask about community opinions on everything and get a better and more informed picture of the game.


It’s also where you can find the latest codes and tier lists. Also, it’s excellent for tracking announcements and updates. I often browse around sneak peeks and patch notes for the latest buffs, nerfs, and new content being added. The game is always growing so giveaways and special events are always mentioned in the Discord first as well.


And that’s how to access the official Project Trigger Trello and Discord. Stay tuned to Destructoid for more Project Trigger and Roblox guides.

                              <span>Destiny 2 has a unique new Exotic weapon for Episode: Heresy: the Barrow-Dyad. The circular sub-machine gun certainly has a fun look, but beyond that, it&#x27;s a force to be reckoned with. Guardians will want to hunt down the Barrow-Dyad for themselves, but they&#x27;ll need to know how first.


While Destiny 2 players may be a bit spoiled after the ease of obtaining the Lodestar Exotic in this Episode, Barrow Dyad will take a bit more work. A multi-part Exotic Quest will take players across the system, into The Nether, and beyond to earn the chic new gun. However, before Guardians start worrying about how to get the new Exotic weapon, the first question should be how to gain access to its Exotic Quest.

                              <span>A new Exotic mission is hitting Destiny 2 a bit sooner than most players expected. The Derealize Exotic mission is here, arriving after only a week into Episode: Heresy. But the mission won&#x27;t give up its secrets or rewards easily -- and opening its doors is a whole other matter.


Destiny 2 has fallen into some comfortable habits, but it&#x27;s refreshing to see Episode: Heresy shake some of those up. Exotic missions typically launch toward the end of a Season or Episode, as seen with Encore in Episode: Echo and the Kell&#x27;s Fall Exotic mission in Episode: Revenant. 


That&#x27;s not the case with Drealize, as players won&#x27;t have to wait to jump into the new outing. That said, Guardians must accomplish some steps and prerequisites before the Exotic mission becomes available.

We have already had some fun rumors about possible new cards.

Server maintenance has been routine in the past, but the frequency has gone down in recent times.

Ahead of the maintenance, EA Sports has shared details about the maintenance timings, allowing players to plan accordingly.


When will the EA FC 25 Server Maintenance (February 12) begin?


The server maintenance will begin at 7 a.m. UTC/11 p.m. PST (February 11)/2 a.m. EST. The scheduled maintenance will be going live simultaneously across all affected platforms, and matchmaking will be paused 30 m…</span>

Where is Katherine during the For Victory quest


One of the side quests for the For Victory! quest tells you to Go into the kitchen for wine to give to Lord Hans Capon for his journey. Unfortunately, if you look all around the castle and specifically the castle kitchen where the quest tells you to look, it turns out Katherine isn&#x27;t actually there!


If you&#x27;re like me, you might think your quest is bugged. But it&#x27;s not! You cannot actually find Katherine at this point in the quest, despite it tel…</span>

All that is about to change, however, as developer CipSoft has revealed that sometime this year the classic MMORPG will receive its first-ever new playable vocation: the Monk. Just the fifth class featured in the nearly three-decade-old MMO, the Monk will join existing vocations Druid, Knight, Paladin, and Sorcerer.


According to CipSoft, the Monk vocation is a melee fighter capable of supporting and healing allies while using martial arts and mystical abilities to defeat its enemies. The Monk class will also wield exclusive speci…</span>

The Sundered Doctrine Dungeon was released on Friday, February 7, kicking off Destiny 2&#x27;s second-ever Dungeon race. Like a Raid race, the last two Dungeons have been released with a Contest mode, massively increasing difficulty and offering some sweet rewards to the brave Fireteams who overcome its challenge. However, PlayStation players didn&#x27;t have as easy of an experience, with lengthy interruptions draining away precious time.

The upcoming sequel to the Mortal Kombat movie reboot from 2021 had been silent for too long. The studio knew it had to break the silence in the most hype way possible, and it sure did. We&#x27;d known Karl Urban would be playing Johnny Cage in the new movie for a while, but this is the first time we get a look at the character, and he looks just right.

After being swamped by a tsunami of &quot;negative feedback, &quot; the rising star hero-shooter has pulled the plug on what many fans have labeled its first big misstep.


Word that Marvel Rivals players would lose their hard-won competitive ranks came in a Dev Diary Post about the big mid-season patch set to drop on February 21, 2025. In its defense, the post wasn&#x27;t all bad news: it confirmed that the patch will add Human Torch and The Thing to the game&#x27;s roster, finally uniting all members of the Fantastic Four together as playable heroes.


However, most Marvel Rivals players (myself included) were far more interested in the news that the patch would also sha…</span>

However, Sigil Shards aren&#x27;t explained very well to players, and you&#x27;ll want to know how to make the most out of the currency.


Destiny 2 will often feature specific resources or currencies tied to an Episode or Season. For Episode: Heresy, that has been Metastasized Essentia scattered around the Dreadnaught, Essence of Desire, best earned from refining Metastasized Essentia, and Sigil Shards. However, after earning the resources themselves, even more important is that players know what to do with them.

                              <span>The Jess Park Future Stars SBC is now live in EA FC 25, and you can complete the challenge to earn a promo item for your Ultimate Team squad.


Park is the latest addition to the promo, and everyone has an equal chance to play with the card as it&#x27;s part of a SBC. To do so, you&#x27;ll need to complete all the tasks before the SBC expires. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can complete the challenge, and if it&#x27;s worth doing so at all. 


EA FC 25 Jess Park Future Stars SBC tasks


The Jess Park Future Stars SBC has only one task, and here are its requirements. 


Task - Jess Park Future Stars SBC



Min. 1 Players from: England


Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Jess Park Future Stars SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a solution you can use to complete the latest Future Stars SBC in EA FC 25. 



Any 87-rated TOTW item


Cancelo 86


Palmer 85


Simons 83


de Ligt 84


Cuthbert 83


White 84


Romagnoli 83


Grimaldo 86


Goretzka 83


Acerbi 84



The only decent part of the SBC is its completion cost, for the card is extremely underpowered. It doesn&#x27;t have two playstyles+, and the stats are mediocre at best. Trickster+ as a single playstyle+ isn&#x27;t effective in the current meta (unless it&#x27;s the Mbappe POTM card we are talking about). She also has only 4* Weak Foot and 4* Skills, making her slightly limited in front of the goal.


Park has decent roles, and 90 Pace and 92 Dribbling is decent. However, you&#x27;ll have to place her in a future evolution if you want to use her in a competitive fashion. The Morgan Rogers Future Stars SBC, in comparison, offers far more value in terms of the fodder used to complete it.

Minimum System Requirements for Avowed


If you&#x27;re looking to just get in and be able and run Avowed on lower settings, you&#x27;ll want to pay attention to these minimum system requirements. It looks like Avowed will be pretty well optimized, as the minimum requirements don&#x27;t require anything taxing at all. In fact, the minimum recommended GPU is a GTX 1070 or equivalent which released almost a decade ago back in 2016. Here are the full minimum system requirements for Avowed:

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 6, Season 1 storyline has you running around the map and hunting down demons. Using a Forecast Tower is among your weekly objectives, but you won&#x27;t find any quest markers for them. Instead, you&#x27;ll have to wait until a few storm circles pass.


Where to find Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Forecast Towers spawn around your Fortnite map just before the third storm circle is announced. They&#x27;ll appear as satellite dish icons on your map, giving you their exact locations. You&#x27;ll usually find two or three during each match.

However, these locations change per round. While the buildings will stay in the same spots, only certain ones will activate during your match. In other words, even if you camp a forecast tower, it may not necessarily turn on, forcing you to find a new one.


How to use Forecast Towers in Fortnite


Once you approach an active forecast tower, you&#x27;ll find a large tower and a small building with a terminal inside. However, you won&#x27;t be able to unlock the terminal without obtaining an access key. It&#x27;s time to fight some enemies.


Screenshot by Destructoid


More specifically, you&#x27;ll have to defeat enemies guarding the forecast tower. They&#x27;ll either spawn right outside the tower or patrol nearby, as shown by a face map icon. They don&#x27;t have much health, but they can still deal some solid damage if you fight them for a while.


Screenshot by Destructoid


The guards you encounter will depend on the current Fortnite season. While some seasons had Latverian henchmen, others, like Chapter 6: Season 1, have demon grunts and lieutenants. Upon defeating a guard, they&#x27;ll drop a Forecast Tower Access Card, which you can use on the terminal to use the forecast tower and finish Fortnite&#x27;s story and weekly quests.

Will the graphics hold up to the stunning promises, or will they crumble under the weight of expectation? Thankfully, my experience in South of Midnight left me in complete awe with its mesmerizing stop-motion visuals, each frame oozing with charm and life.


Initially, I was skeptical about how the animation from its reveal trailer would translate into the gaming world. But with Compulsion Games behind the wheel, the creators of the intriguing We Happy Few, I was more than willing to dive in. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to realize just how brilliantly the stop-motion came to life, almost like stepping into a living, breathing folklore novel. Sure, there were a few minor …</span>

Length-wise, this puts tomorrow&#x27;s State of Play about on par with Sony&#x27;s most recent State of Play from September which ran just shy of 40 minutes and ended with the reveal of Ghost of Yotei. Other notable announcements from the September State of Play included the Monster Hunter Wilds release date which is now just around the corner on February 28, Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered which turned out quite good, the reveal of a Lunar Remastered Collection and a non…</span>

When it comes to playing board games with the younger generation, it can be pretty hard to keep their attention focused on the task at hand, especially if you want to play something that sneaks in some educational value hidden beneath the layer of family fun time that’s more obvious to young eyes. 


As a mother, I’ve spent a lot of time cultivating a board game selection that isn’t just fun, but also educational. I honestly believe that learning is best done when the learner doesn’t notice that they’re learning anything at all. It reduces p…</span>

This quest takes place in the Trosky region after the wedding when you&#x27;re taken to the castle. First, you&#x27;ll have to find Thomas, which is already a tough task. Then you&#x27;ll have to cure him of his infection. So here&#x27;s how to do that.

                              <span>One of the main parts of Hello Kitty Island Adventure is deepening your connections and friendships with the many Sanrio characters who inhabit Friendship Island alongside you. These friendships unlock quests and reward rare resources, but what happens when you become Best Friends?


Becoming Best Friends with a character happens when you reach maximum friendship with them. This could be at level 15, 20, or 25, depending on the character. Once you reach this point, they’ll stop giving you their basic resource return gifts and start giving Character Gift Boxes instead. 


If you’re working your way up to Best Friends with any of the characters, we have a useful gift guide that can take you through the entire process.

What’s weirder is that I’ve found it thoroughly enjoyable, and I don’t even have a no-good, pig-stealing, great-great grandfather who cursed my life to get me here. 


Yes, that’s a reference to Louis Sachar’s Holes, because the book has been freshly brought to mind in light of A Game About Digging a Hole, which lets you live out your childhood inner demon&#x27;s deepest desire, and absolutely destroy the back garden of a house while looking for treasure.


Since this bizarre little game was released on February 7, I’ve been channeling my inner Stanley Yelnats and getting to grips with the mechanics involved in digging a hole. The process is a lot more complicated th…</span>

Just like in the Antiquity Age, there are different civilizations available in the two latter ages. But to play them, you&#x27;ll first have to fulfill certain unlock requirements.


How to unlock all Exploration Age civilizations in Civilization 7


The Exploration Age is the first after Antiquity, and you&#x27;ll be able to choose how you want to proceed with your save. Your selection will depend on your actions during the first age, and you can only choose civilizations that you&#x27;ve unlocked.


Here&#x27;s how to unlock the Exploration Age civilizations.

Thankfully, there are ways you can speed up this process, and we&#x27;re going to tell you how.

There are actually quite a few methods for leveling up fast in DBOG, and we&#x27;re going to list our favorites from least effective to most effective. However, we recommend you try all of them and see which one works best for you.

Every week, a fresh new Snorlax will appear, giving you the chance to boost its Drowsy Power with recipes that can be cooked up and fed to it at regular intervals throughout the day. Increasing this Drowsy Power (and cultivating good sleeping habits) is definitely worth it, because the higher the power, the more Pokémon will be drawn in for you to capture and befriend, including some rare ones with potentially new Sleep Styles.

Fantasy is about losing yourself in a world that doesn&#x27;t play by the same dull rules as ours. By adding a layer of sound to the reading experience, a fantasy audiobook can turn the people and places we&#x27;re reading about into breathing, moving pictures that play out in the mind like a film beamed onto a diamond screen.

U každého vydání jsem jen hlásil, že je vše přeložené, poslední roky to platilo i pro drtivou většinu dokumentace. Poslední rok se to ale začalo zadrhávat. Přispěvatelé, kteří to dlouhé roky táhli, odešli a není nikdo, kdo by to po nich převzal. Proto jsme se rozhodli jít s pravdou ven: GNOME momentálně nemá české překladatele a pokud se toho neujme někdo nový, překlady začnou postupně upadat.&quot;</span>

                              <span>How Sony is helping us LCDeal with it.
The reveal of Switch 2 back in January answered some burning questions but mainly it confirmed rumoured details and leaked info regarding the size, shape, and magnetic Joy-Con of Nintendo&#x27;s next console. Annoyingly, there are still a lot of unanswered questions and the platform holder is keeping shtum until 2nd April.
One big question is about the screen: Will Switch 2 have an LCD display like the original Switch or a gloriously vibrant OLED panel like the boring-but-appropriately-named Switch OLED Model?

Thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds&#x27; recent beta tests and ever-closer release date (28th Feb), all eyes are on what&#x27;s next for the series. Importantly, this is a next-gen entry and, despite the wishes of Capcom&#x27;s investors, that means it&#x27;s not scheduled to come to Switch.
But what about Switch 2? That&#x27;s what series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and director Yuya Tokuda were asked in a recent interview with Spanish outlet Gamereactor. While the pair obviously didn&#x27;t spill the beans on any kind of Switch 2 confirmation, Tsujimoto did share some insight into the team&#x27;s thoughts on the upcoming hardware: namely, they want more info too.

                              <span>And it&#x27;s stunning.
Nintendo and Lego have already dipped their toes into the Mario Kart series with some official sets, but if we&#x27;re being honest, we&#x27;re not overly keen on the output so far. It&#x27;s just lacking some of that signature Nintendo ingenuity, y&#x27;know?
So, we were absolutely thrilled when we stumbled across this stunning Lego Mario Kart concept – built by user Bbeethoven99 – on Reddit that utilises a conveyor belt mechanism to simulate the feeling of movement. Essentially, the rainbow road track rotates around the conveyor belt, while the kart in the centre shifts left and right according to the steering wheel on the front.

A new Kickstarter campaign is now up and running for a proposed new adventure game serving as a spiritual successor to the LucasArts classic Maniac Mansion.
Developed by Spanish team Straynus, Cronela&#x27;s Mansion is earmarked for NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and of course, the Nintendo Switch. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s currently sailing past the 50% mark of its €125,000 goal with 22 days remaining.

                              <span>It hurt itself in its confusion.
GAME staff have accused the UK retailer of &quot;scalping&quot; Pokémon cards after the company began hitching massive shipping costs to the online sale of &#x27;Prismatic Evolutions&#x27; mini tins (thanks, Eurogamer).
These mini tins are no novelty for a TCG expansion. They contain two booster packs and a collectible coin and retail for £10.99, tidy. The problem is that GAME is adding a bulky £19.99 &quot;Oversized delivery&quot; fee on top of that, making the overall purchase a little less &#x27;mini&#x27; than the name suggests.

With the Lunar Remastered Collection just over two months away, RPG fans will be able to get their hands on two beloved turn-based adventures from the Sega Saturn and PlayStation era. Today, ahead of the game&#x27;s release, publisher GungHo Online Entertainment has shared some details about the game regarding the North American release.
In a fleshed-out FAQ section on the official website, GungHo reconfirms that the game will be launching both physically and digitally, exclusively on Amazon in North America. Store pages are even up. However, you won&#x27;t be able to pre-order the game ahead of its release, and instead, you&#x27;ll have to buy it on release day.

Looking back on 2011&#x27;s Fortune Street (or &#x27;Boom Street&#x27; for those in Europe) today feels like a fever dream. A Wii board game starring Mario &amp; co. that isn&#x27;t Mario Party? One that&#x27;s published by Nintendo but developed by Square Enix? And also features a handful of familiar faces from the Dragon Quest series? Sounds like something you&#x27;d find in a nasty AI-generated mash-up, no?
Fortunately (heh), Fortune Street was anything but. Sure, the crossover never quite reached the heights of the Mario Party series, but the bonkers board game has still managed to build up quite the following in the years since — even grabbing the attention of some rather talented modders.

                              <span>Your move, Nintendo.
Sony has seemingly finally made a move against some of the so-called &#x27;eSlop&#x27; plaguing digital storefronts in recent years.
According to True Trophies (thanks Push Square), the company has removed a whole bunch of titles from the PSN store, mostly from developer RandomSpin Games. This comes after an extensive investigation from IGN, numerous complaints from developers, and our own coverage on the issue.

                              <span>It could be a big year for Nintendo&#x27;s racer.
Nintendo-related LEGO leaks have been quite accurate in the past - with perhaps the biggest one of the lot so far being The Legend of Zelda Deku Tree set. Now, new rumours have surfaced online about another &quot;massive&quot; Nintendo-themed set.
According to multiple reports, the next major Nintendo set could be a Mario Kart one valued at $169.99 and launching in July 2025. (thanks, Brick Fanatics). Multiple Lego leakers have apparently shared evidence of listings for this new set including the product code 72037.

In case you missed it, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered was released on the Switch at the end of last year.
A new physical retail version has now surfaced and it&#x27;s being distributed by Aspyr - the same team behind this modern rerelease. It&#x27;s priced at $29.99 USD or you can grab a deluxe edition for $49.99 USD (or your reigional equivalent). Pre-orders are now live on Amazon, with a release scheduled to take place in June 2025.

Capcom last week confirmed the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 would be arriving on the Switch and multiple other platforms in May 2025.
Ahead of the launch of this new collection, the first batch of previews and impressions have gone live - starting with fighting game enthusiast Maximillian Dood, who went hands-on with select titles including Capcom vs. SNK 2, Project Justice and Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper during a Capcom event. Here are his thoughts:

The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw &quot;Lala Barina&quot; out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki&#x27;s subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

Yes, what would you do, with an infinite shoe?
Would you melt it to make yourself infinite glue?
Or to infinite dogs &#x27;pon which to infinitely chew?
Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I&#x27;m very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me rhyming cancer. Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there&#x27;s usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game&#x27;s Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

And that decision to build small is going to be the plan from now on. No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.

                              <span>It is I, the guy who has only played Mechabellum playing his second autobattler, and getting strong Mechabellum vibes from it. Except, actually no, not at all. He Is Coming, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike RPG. You&#x27;ll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You&#x27;re actually on the clock: the &#x27;he&#x27; of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

In what can only be described as a bizarre finale,  GoTech now promotes Nagra as its partner.

After a handful of delays, we are slowly creeping up on the April 2025 release window for Level-5&#x27;s much-anticipated Fantasy Life follow-up, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. With the countdown officially on (assuming it isn&#x27;t pushed again, of course), Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino has taken to Twitter to share a fresh look at the game — and it&#x27;s looking really rather swell.
Translated via Google, Hino prefaced the screenshot drop by stating that major information reveals for the game have been slightly delayed by issues with &quot;compatible models and new hardware&quot; (what could he possibly be referring to there, eh?), but the visuals and content have developed to make the upcoming title &quot;one of the best RPGs out there&quot;. No pressure there, then.

Before Kirby and the Forgotten Land swooped in with its excellent 3D take on the classic Kirby formula, Kirby: Planet Robobot for 3DS was widely regarded as the best entry in the series.
Now, according to reliable leaker Nate the Hate, the 2016 platformer may be getting a similar treatment to Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD with an upcoming port on Switch.

Two clamshell OLED monitors that promised Switch connectivity for on-the-go multiplayer mayhem obviously brought the potential for big-screen DS play to mind, but would the Duoone OLED actually live up to these lofty goals? That&#x27;s what our Alex has been investigating.
The Duoone OLED cuts a pretty sweet-looking figure, we&#x27;ll admit. Alex got his hands on the two main models, the &#x27;Span&#x27; and the &#x27;Fold&#x27;, both of which consist of two additional screens that you can plug your Switch into for... well, more screens.

If you, like us, have been eagerly waiting for new information on Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate, then you&#x27;re just going to have to be patient and wait a bit longer.
However, given that next to nothing has been shared regarding the game since its initial teaser trailer in 2021, it&#x27;s understandable if you&#x27;re feeling somewhat anxious about its development. Thankfully, in a new livestream (thanks, Automaton), creator Yuji Horii has stated that the development team is &quot;working hard on Dragon Quest XII&quot;.

If you&#x27;d have told us five years ago that Batman: Arkham Knight would make its way to the Nintendo Switch, we would have laughed in your face and waddled off back to the Iceberg Lounge.
Alas, alongside its predecessors, Arkham Knight arrived on Switch in December 2023, and though it wasn&#x27;t particularly very good in terms of performance (in fact, we&#x27;d say it was incredibly poor), it was nevertheless a surprising addition to the Switch library of games.

                              <span>Cheery mom-and-pop computer game business Valve have created a new Steamworks page for their policy about in-game adverts and advertising in general, with a troubleshooter&#x27;s list of dos and don&#x27;ts for developers.
As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve&#x27;s handling of such things hasn&#x27;t really changed over the past few years, but I can&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can&#x27;t bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

Good news for people who enjoy sniping fascists from across the map while commanding a barrel-armed Irishmen to simultaneously slit a throat. And equally good news for those who lament the loss of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun developer Mimimi Games.

                              <span>The RPS review of Firaxis&#x27; grand strategy Civilisation 7 is currently in progress. We didn&#x27;t get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it&#x27;s coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that &quot;its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable&quot;. Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game&#x27;s advanced access period.

                              <span>Would you like the good or the bad news first? Obviously I can&#x27;t actually respond to that, so I&#x27;ll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media&#x27;s Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of &#x27;digital piracy&#x27;. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

                              <span>This week is the week of Valentine&#x27;s Day, and therefore theoretically the most romantic week of the year even though it&#x27;s still winter here and the drizzle feels like it&#x27;s falling inside my bones and the thought of another human&#x27;s touch makes me want to wipe myself with sandpaper.
Some trivia from a person who&#x27;s been in a relationship for decades: Valentine&#x27;s Day comes less than a month after &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week&#x27;s new PC games likely won&#x27;t help, assuming you aren&#x27;t especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well. Let&#x27;s commence feeding the Maw and hope that we strike a few sparks of amore from the creature&#x27;s heaving flanks.

                              <span>God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don&#x27;t have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

                              <span>Roguelike deckbuilders need to do something pretty special to stand out nowadays, what with the Slay The Spileup of bangers over the past few years. Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

                              <span>After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels are &quot;looking to return to Batman for a single-player game&quot;, according to a report by Bloomberg. Rocksteady Studios haven&#x27;t said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims &quot;the new project is years away from landing&quot;, so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio&#x27;s open world Batman games.

                              <span>Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that Grand Theft Auto 6 is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA&#x27;s arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

                              <span>The Nvidia RTX 5080 is out! Kind of. In theory. If you can find one. But here’s the thing: it&#x27;s basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.

The fancy-schmancy MGS3 remake is coming out in August, according to the store page. And you can also catch sight of a camouflaged trailer if you go looking under the right rocks.

It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they&#x27;re being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

Football Manager 25 has been cancelled because it has not met a high enough standard in time for its intended release next month, according to developers Sports Interactive. Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be given a refund, they say.

The move follows similar orders obtained last year against DNS resolvers.

                              <span>Earlier this week, a plastic bag blowing in the wind made me question all I knew about the world, but in whatever way the opposite of life-affirming is. Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other&#x27;s crotches for eternity.
I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here&#x27;s a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

                              <span>True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

                              <span>The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer Duskers are making a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the 2016 space game. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they&#x27;re currently working on. The working title for this one is &quot;Humanity 2.0&quot; and it&#x27;ll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you&#x27;ll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer &quot;fun personality quirks&quot; when you install upgrades, &quot;like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it&#x27;s now claustrophobic&quot;. 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I&#x27;m interested.

                              <span>Sci-fi battle royale Apex Legends is due a &quot;meaningful update&quot; , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he&#x27;s called &quot;Apex 2.0&quot;. To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game&#x27;s name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it&#x27;s not clear if that&#x27;s exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they&#x27;re prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

                              <span>In 2024 the Motion Picture Association and the Premier League celebrated notable anti-piracy wins in Vietnam. The collapse of the Fmovies empire and the conviction of a person linked to a major IPTV provider, marked rare progress in a difficult region. Yet, increasing doubts over what happens next in Vietnam has sparked concerns that not even the biggest wins offer guaranteed progression.

                              <span>When I’ve had enough of fighting the dogs in a respectable, straightforward manner, I pick them up with my mind and - with a casualness that has to be extremely insulting if you’re a dog - drop them directly off a cliff. This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. 

In Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a &quot;weaver band&quot;, a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong.

                              <span>Hark, or whatever that is in Czech. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has earned Playable status on the Steam Deck, and it’s a shrewd assessment on Valve’s part: there are some shortcomings that keep the coveted Verified badge out of Deliverance 2’s reach, most notably its cramped UI, but I’ve been bumbling around the medieval RPG for hours now and it is indeed plenty functional in handheld mode. Despite its system requirements arguably suggesting otherwise, it can even manage some decent 40fps-plus performance without dumping all the quality settings to their lowest.

                              <span>The first wave of Nvidia 50 series GPUs have arrived. Now they&#x27;re gone. So, if you need an RTX 5080-prebuilt gaming PCs are currently your best bet of securing. While Dell has got some overpriced $5000+ Alienware 51 desktops up for preorder, there other (considerably cheaper, but not necessarily affordable) options up for grabs right now.

                              <span>Vendrán Las Aves - &quot;The Birds Will Come&quot; - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a &quot;slice of life tamagotchi&quot; and available in Spanish and English, it&#x27;s a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.
It&#x27;s free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody&#x27;s one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.

Wreckfest 2 is the follow-up to smashing racer Wreckfest, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our best racing games. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have &quot;overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem.&quot; We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t end up covering as many classic point and click adventures as I&#x27;d like on RPS. That&#x27;s a real shame, because every time I play a good one, I&#x27;m reminded how much magic the genre still has. Developer Blyts (Kelvin And The Infamous Machine) was kind enough to send me over a key for Slender Threads, which is out this Friday. My opinion as a complete non-expert on the genre? Yep, this one&#x27;s absolutely worth a look.

It&#x27;s the sort of boast most demon swordsman like to trot out, in my experience. And yet! I have to admit that this Gogandantess lad has a real flourish to him. He&#x27;s going places, I reckon. Chief among those places being PC at some point in 2025, and he&#x27;s bringing the rest of Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny with him. Catch him showing off in the below trailer.

                              <span>Warhorse&#x27;s medieval muck-o-rama Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launches today. It&#x27;s an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra&#x27;s tendency to throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns. Also, a relatively bug-free one. 


In the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I&#x27;ve encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2&#x27;s eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.

                              <span>Several hours in, it’s become apparent that I lack the patience for much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s much-publicised historical accuracies, like needing to bathe yourself every six minutes or how 15th century Bohemians can take several consecutive sword swings to the neck without dying. Ah well! If you’re going to play it, know that it’s also a decent performer on PC – despite the almost threatening tone of its recommended system requirements – and, as far as I can see, isn’t anywhere near as bug-prone as the infamously unstable original.

Terry Cavanagh, also the maker of VVVVVV and Dicey Dungeons, is releasing a collection of his freeware bits and bobs on Steam next week, called simply Terry&#x27;s Other Games. Looking at the games included, it summons a nostalgic giggle just to see just how many of Terry&#x27;s short games have been intriguing enough to grab the eye of an RPS writer over the years. I mean it literally. One game is called Grab Them By The Eyes.

                              <span>Peter Akemann - co-founder of Call Of Duty&#x27;s Treyarch and recent president of The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners studio Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to crashing a drone into a firefighting plane assisting with the recent LA wildfires. The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I&#x27;m not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.
The drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That&#x27;s a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he&#x27;s &quot;hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,&quot; write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.

                              <span>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) covered the announcement for Forgotlings back in 2023. It&#x27;s a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind Forgotton Anne - one of my favourites from 2018. Forgotlings, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a Steam demo. This is such good news I&#x27;ve basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.

                              <span>I was initially sceptical that we&#x27;d be seeing dark fantasy strategy RPG Whispers Of The Eyeless any time soon. I follow the game&#x27;s creator Venris on YouTube. He&#x27;s co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the Total War: Warhammer III overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me he mods for around &quot;eight to 12 hours a day&quot;, though, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in Steam early access. Edwin described it as &quot;Darkest Dungeon, but you&#x27;re running the dungeon&quot;. That&#x27;s better than anything I could come up with, so let&#x27;s stick with that.

This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt&#x27;s taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM&#x27;s collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They&#x27;ve previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsuragi&#x27;s jacket. I&#x27;m not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.
As the man who couldn&#x27;t afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let&#x27;s try and keep an open mind about this. The bag&#x27;s Dyneema fabric &quot;is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials&quot;.

                              <span>I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was Roots Devour - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.

The insights arrive just few days after a new site blocking bill was introduced in the United States. Not surprisingly, the MPA&#x27;s &#x27;best practices&#x27; for site blocking largely align with proposed legislative amendments.

                              <span>After several hours of battles, sieges, imprisonment and torture in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a groggy Henry of Skalitz is woken by a servant girl in a castle outside Kuttenberg. She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He&#x27;s a blacksmith&#x27;s son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn&#x27;t have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn&#x27;t be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it&#x27;s more than her job&#x27;s worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she&#x27;s dismissed in a manner befitting her station.

                              <span>Minecraft recently dropped pig variants into beta, giving porkly variants in cold and warm climates. The other barnyard animals were presumably breighing and neighing from the neglect, but here comes a solution: cows are getting cold cow and warm cow variants, too.

                              <span>There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called &quot;the piss filter&quot; and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there&#x27;s at least one developer who is reviving &quot;smeared dirt&quot; as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.

But the calm times are coming to an end. The big releases now march towards us in droves. But they do not know what lies waiting for them in the moat. The slick scales of the Maw surface in the moonlight, groaning, waiting, sick with hunger for fresh releases. The battle is yet to start, but we will upturn the chumbucket of news into the water below. Feed it, for heavens sake. FEED THE MAW!

                              <span>Russia&#x27;s campaign to block access to content deemed illegal by the state is continuously monitored by digital rights group Roskomsvoboda. In 2024, over 500,000 websites were subjected to blocking measures, pushing the all-time site blocking total to more than 1.8 million. While VPNs also face blocking, the task isn&#x27;t always straightforward. The data shows that sales sites in Russia prefer to expose IP addresses owned by foreign companies, located outside Russia.

Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA&#x27;s export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.

                              <span>The future of AI innovation may hinge on the outcome of a global copyright debate.  In the U.S., rightsholders are taking a hard line, pursuing legal action against AI companies that utilize copyrighted works without permission.  However, other countries are adopting more lenient approaches, allowing AI models to learn from the vast troves of data found in &#x27;pirate&#x27; libraries. This &#x27;copyright schism&#x27; could have far-reaching consequences.

A California federal court denied a request for a preliminary injunction, ruling that Apple did not act unreasonably or in bad faith when it removed the app following complaints from music industry players and YouTube. The court found that Musi’s proposed injunction would not serve the public interest.

                              <span>As rumoured, The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 have returned to (official) PC stores. Kindly Uncle EA has taken a break from his busy layoff schedule to rustle up a pair of Legacy collections that include a bunch of old expansions. It&#x27;s the very first time the original Sims has graced a digital retail platform, I believe - it was first released in 2000, back when people used to access the internet using smoke signals and semaphore. Anyway, here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>Nvidia DLSS 4 has launched under not-terribly-happy circumstances. It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.
However, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.
Here, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.

It&#x27;ll be pulled from Steam, the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation and Xbox stores at the end of its next season, though you&#x27;ll still be able to get your fill of Bugs Bunny bashing offline against either friends or bots.

                              <span>The post-launch update and DLC schedule for Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII slightly discombobulates me, because the image above is weirdly reminiscent of Civ 7&#x27;s own historical Age progression screens. But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke &quot;all roadmaps lead to Rome&quot;.* 


In case you missed it, the new 4X strategy jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.

                              <span>The creator of frying pan simulator Arctic Eggs is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from Animal Crossing, Sega Bass Fishing, and Webfishing, says developer The Water Museum in a post on Bluesky. It may have a splash of Dredge when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, a strange man might imply you are &quot;disappointing someone&quot;. Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not turn completely red. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.

                              <span>Hidden away on NASA&#x27;s Golden Record, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, Élévation, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out &quot;the vast sorrows and all the vexations&quot; of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.

                              <span>Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I&#x27;m well aware that &quot;2.5D&quot; and &quot;Soulsvania&quot; are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every &#x27;vania yet coined.
But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here&#x27;s a trailer.

                              <span>Don&#x27;t get too comfortable. As an RPG that puts you in the synthetic boots of an escaped robo-person, Citizen Sleeper 2 often has you on the run. It&#x27;s a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can&#x27;t - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game&#x27;s compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next. But it has a good time trying.

                              <span>Bioware released a statement yesterday. It talked of &quot;turning towards the future&quot;. It dreamed of &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;. Nowhere in the post did the word &quot;layoffs&quot; appear. But this is what the post was actually about. The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: &quot;we don’t require support from the full studio.&quot; 
It&#x27;s one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of our &quot;favourite&quot; mealy-mouthed press releases in which people have their jobs poetically &quot;sunsetted&quot; rather than, say, dropkicked out the window.

                              <span>The last Minesweeperalike I wrote up was a sparkling slurry of mind-altering pop-ups and resinous AI cleavage. It was David Cronenberg&#x27;s Minesweeper: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I&#x27;d put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It&#x27;s Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.

                              <span>The layoff train has come for BioWare. A number of Dragon Age: The Veilguard staff are leaving the celebrated RPG company in the course of plans to become &quot;a more agile, focused studio&quot;, as BioWare move ahead with the next Mass Effect game. Posting on Bluesky, senior systems designer Michelle Flamm, producer Jen Cheverie, editor Karin West-Weekes, lead writer Trick Weekes and narrative designer Ryan Cormier have all announced that they&#x27;re looking for work.


All of which feels like it warrants a mention in general manager Gary McKay&#x27;s recent blog about BioWare&#x27;s future, but he comments only that they&#x27;re &quot;taking the opportunity to reimagine&quot; how BioWare operate between projects, and &quot;have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit.&quot; Which is a very slippery way to say that you&#x27;re making a load of people redundant.

                              <span>Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.
Granted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.

                              <span>Looks like they finally got the message. &quot;An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC,&quot; said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It&#x27;s been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn&#x27;t seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they&#x27;ve now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.

That said, this is the precise extent of the things you can do in the game so far. Build &#x27;n&#x27; crash. Every feature fits in this opening paragraph. There&#x27;s good reason to trust the developers&#x27; ability to deliver the rest of this crafting and survival game. But right now, it&#x27;s all core, no loop.

                              <span>Open world spec op gun-brandisher Phantom Line takes place during a paranormal crisis of such intensity that the outbreak of nuclear war gets relegated to bullet point five on the latest press email. Atomic apocalypse? Ehhh. That&#x27;s a roadside picnic compared to what S.T.A.L.K.S this alternately Lynchian and Tarkovskian battlefield. You&#x27;ll wish you&#x27;d been dusted by nuclear fire when you&#x27;re being torn open by some kind of demon puppet in a labyrinth of red curtains.


If you do get torn open by a demon puppet, the good news is that players have a range of artificial bodies to choose from. Among Phantom Line&#x27;s headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners. If all this sounds appealing, the even-gooder news is that there&#x27;s now a demo available via the developer Discord.

In brief, it&#x27;s a VR collaboration between D&amp;D traffickers Wizards Of The Coast and Demeo studio Resolution Games that aims to simulate a tactical co-op tabletop experience without any of the boring bits, like seeing your mates&#x27; genuine reactions to things or having your frigid digitised soul warmed at the hearth of human kinship.

                              <span>Nic says that RPG remake sequel Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is &quot;uneven, unfocused, and unmissable&quot;. You also can’t miss its regular performance hiccups, which most often manifest as little but frequent stutters that occur as you’re moseying around its poorly planet. 
Or can you? News comes via Nic himself that modder FrancisLouis, whose previous works include performance-enhancing rejigs of various games (and one that turns the Silent Hill 2 remake’s pipe weapon into a rigid, A-posing wife), has produced Fantasy Optimizer: an overhaul of how FF7 Rebirth handles shaders and streamed visuals. Both Nic and myself have tried it out on our respective rigs, and it works! Mostly.

                              <span>Has any genus of graphics card been as dramatically storied as the GeForce XX80s? The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.
It isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.

                              <span>I cherish my fairly sharp memories of the 2016 launch version of No Man&#x27;s Sky, inasmuch as the contrast renders the latest additions to the wistful space game all the more dazzling. Dazzling and exhausting. What was once a relatively (and to some extent unintentionally) lean procgen exploration sim has swelled into a game of mechs, fishing, fickle weather systems, intricate asteroid engagements, starbases, nautiloids and capes. It is far bigger than it reasonably needs to be, and it&#x27;s only getting more and more, er, infinite.

                              <span>Friend, I regret to inform you that ant nests are computers now. Which is to say, somebody&#x27;s finally made a video game version of Hex, the sentient glass hive from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Unseen University. In spooky automation-driven strategy sim Microtopia, you manage a swarm of what could either be ants who&#x27;ve been to the ripperdoc, or PC components who&#x27;ve grown legs and antennae. Your goal is to expand an insect colony that is also a motherboard, where glittering pheromone trails double as silicon circuits.
The developers Cordyceps Collective have just announced a release date - February 18th - and what&#x27;s this, there&#x27;s a demo as well? Catch the trailer below.

                              <span>Sniper At Work is the work of Cherrypick Games, hitherto known for &quot;soothing merge-2 experiences&quot; featuring puppy-eyed princes. The only &quot;twos&quot; you shall be &quot;merging&quot; in Sniper At Work are bullets and faces. The only &quot;cherries&quot; you shall be &quot;picking&quot; are hoodlums in sore need of a skullful of lead. The only princes you shall acknowledge are their royal highnesses Distance, Wind, and Timing.
You may or may not find all that &quot;soothing&quot; - I won&#x27;t judge. I will only repeat Nic&#x27;s observation from the Maw that Sniper At Work look &quot;a bit like Commandos, a bit like Hitman&quot;, which I would translate to &quot;my comrade in PC gaming, if historic audience trends are any indication you shall do well here&quot;. Right, that&#x27;s enough quotation marks for one article. There won&#x27;t be any left for the next interview feature at this rate. Here&#x27;s the trailer.

Unwelcoming but oddly comfortable in its rusty soviet Ozymandism. The first sign of sentient life this immersive sim offers me is the greeting of a gasmasked freakdroid as I leave a warehouse. Tinny propaganda songs play from TVs too big to comfortably fit in anyone&#x27;s car. The warehouse is so huge I thought it was outside until I looked up and there was writing on the sky and I realised it was a roof. I&#x27;m still messed up about it, honestly.

                              <span>In regular Darkest Dungeon 2, your mind, body and soul are fixed upon the points of a horrible mountain, looming over the inn at the end of every foetid wagon ride. It&#x27;s sort of Journey for plague doctors, or possibly The Hobbit: Cosmodick Turpin Edition. I enjoy feeling the weight of those distant peaks upon my brain and eyeballs, but it&#x27;s nice to fire up Kingdoms, the new free DD2 game mode that&#x27;s launched just today, and have a choice of disasters to trundle toward.  


Over here is an inn being overrun by slathering beastmen. Over there is another, safer inn, but it&#x27;s inconveniently perched behind a nest of tentacular cultists. In the middle there is you, with the customary DD party of half-dead, half-mad adventurers, equipped with an exciting smorgasbord of sharp edges, cursed artefacts, phobias and diseases. Let us proceed laughing and wailing to the launch trailer.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They&#x27;re letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of Star Wars Outlaws and Skull And Bones. All this less than two months after jettisoning the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

                              <span>Look up, planet-lubber. Space Engineers 2 launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It&#x27;s the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second.

                              <span>Today I learned about balut, a street food of the Philippines. It&#x27;s a fertilized duck egg, boiled or steamed, in which you can still see the duck embryo as you munch. I&#x27;m too old to discover this acquired taste on a gap year, but I&#x27;m not too old to waltz down the horror aisle in Itch.io, throwing retro jumpscarers into my basket. Which is where first-person Filipino suspense game Hapunan can be found. You play a young street food vendor hawking the eggs on a quiet corner late at night. Naturally, something alarming is afoot. There is talk on the radio of dangerous folk out at night...

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Then Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release. Now, we&#x27;re getting Team Ninja&#x27;s Rise Of The Ronin this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I&#x27;d do a bit about stealth drops but I&#x27;m at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here&#x27;s a trailer:

                              <span>I reckon you&#x27;re likely to be in one of two camps with precision platformer Bauhaus Bonk - which I instantly appreciate for giving me an excuse to use the word &quot;bopping&quot; -  either finding it so easy you wonder what the point is, or getting genuinely sucked in by its deceptive trickiness. It&#x27;s a single-button affair, having you navigate levels by alternating a pivot-point on a shape I don&#x27;t know the name of so I&#x27;m just going to call a spinny stick.
There are moving background elements in some stages - in others, you make your own pace. Except I can&#x27;t really make my own pace, can I Bauhaus Bonk? Because the swing soundtrack makes me feel like a plodding buffoon if I&#x27;m not responding with appropriate gusto. This is entrapment, game. I am devilishly compelled by swing, like a Reefer Madness extra.

Like the 2000&#x27;s themselves, it feels both alive with promise and liable to turn bad at any moment.

                              <span>Měl jsem z toho převládající WTF pocit, který byl víceméně příjemný, protože něco takového se hned tak nevidí a bylo jasné, že tvůrci měli nějakou jasnou dramatickou vizi - i když jsem ji nepochopil. Mělo to mít nějakou jinou &quot;message&quot; než &quot;když jsi psychopatický gangster, špatně dopadneš&quot;? Ale docela to uteklo. Jednoznačné mínus a nechtěný (zřejmě?) humor tkví ve skutečnosti, že hlavní hrdinka (t.j. žena) pořád vypadá jako nabušený chlap v paruce a během celého filmu to žádné jiné postavě nepřijde divné.

                              <span>Z &quot;Párty Hárd&quot; jsem byl nadšen, ale tohle jako kdyby natočil (a především napsal) někdo úplně jiný. Ano, vizuálně to vypadá o něco profesionálněji, ale jaksi se vytratila většina chytřejšího humoru a zůstaly jen &quot;věci na jistotu&quot; jako sprostá mluva, zvracení a fekálie. Ve filmu je mnoho víceminutových scén, při kterých se NIKDO v plném sále ani neuchechtl, a to je tohoto typu snímku na pováženou. (Ilča 40 %)</span>
