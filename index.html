                    <span>It&#x27;s all been building to this. The Game Awards 2021 promises to be a night to remember, featuring a massive slate of announcements, the crowning of a new Game of the Year winner, and even a musical performance by Sting (what the gamers are really here for). To celebrate the evening&#x27;s festivities, we&#x27;re going live and covering it all over on Twitch starting at 6:15 p.m. CT!

We know you&#x27;ll be there watching along with us, but what else will happen during the biggest award show of the year? For starters, we already know who has a chance at the big prizes such as Best Performance, Best Game Direction, and the highly sought-after Game of the Year award. Deathloop, Metroid Dread, Psychonauts 2, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and Resident Evil Village have a shot at the big prize, and without a clear-cut favorite like The Last of Us Part II in 2020, it could be anyone&#x27;s award this year.
On top of the array of award winners, The Game Awards 2021 is set to have a metric ton of announcements and reveals featuring some of the biggest titles in the industry. We already know Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderworld, and whatever the next Sonic game is will make an appearance, but what else does host Geoff Keighley and company have up their sleeves? Will Elden Ring be making another appearance? Will we hear from early-2022 juggernauts such as Pokémon Legends: Arceus or Horizon Forbidden West? Only time will tell.
On the Game Informer side, your hosts for the evening will be none other than Alex Stadnik and Prima Games editor Jesse Vitelli. The official show kicks off at 7 p.m. CT, but we&#x27;ll be starting things early at 6:15 p.m. CT to cover some predictions we have and watch the preshow along with you!

                    <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is getting quite a bit smaller with a new update next week. Not content-wise, that&#x27;s all staying put, but rather the file size of the game will shrink on all platforms thanks to a data restructure. 
Not only will your hard drive or SSD have some spare room after the 1.4.1., Valhalla will feature &quot;faster loading screen times, improved world data streaming, and overall runtime performance&quot; compared to previous versions. 
If you notice that the download sizes are huge, they are! This update requires the full base game to be redownloaded, so plan accordingly to not unexpectedly fly over your data cap. Your DLC, luckily, will not factor into the updating process.
Here&#x27;s the data straight from Ubisoft&#x27;s forum post:
Download size from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1:
PC ~78 GB
PS4 ~67 GB
PS5 ~40 GB
X1 ~62 GB
XS ~71 GB
Disc space used after installing 1.4.1:
PC ~77 GB
PS4 ~75 GB
PS5 ~77 GB
X1 ~63 GB
XS ~72 GB
Disc space saved after rebase:
PC ~34 GB
PS4 ~30 GB
PS5 ~13 GB
X1 ~30 GB
XS ~44 GB
It&#x27;s a little strange to see a complete data restructure pushed to a game that&#x27;s been available for a year, but it&#x27;s also a welcome sight with the ballooning sizes of games. Potentially shrinking a game by a third of its size is a commendable feat, and one I hope is considered much earlier in the development process for future games.
Will you be redownloading AC Valhalla to check out this new update next week? I guess you may not have a choice if you want to play the game with any online connectivity. But let us know in the comments anyway!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s campaign launched today, meaning that the game is more or less out in its entirety. If you’ve enjoyed the orchestral music while playing either the story or in multiplayer, you can listen to those tunes anywhere with the release of the game’s soundtrack. 
The original score for Halo Infinite’s campaign and its multiplayer is now available to listen to on major streaming services. These are two separate albums, courtesy of Skill Tree Records, a host of composers including Gareth Coker and Curtis Schweizer, all organized by 343’s music supervisor, Joel Yarger. You can also purchase and download each album digitally for $9.99 from Skill Tree directly at the following links.

                    <span>The Nintendo Switch has an incredibly strong library of games, with many worth recommending. For our 10 absolute favorite games, however, you can check out the list below. It&#x27;s a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release. We will kick games off and add new ones as the Switch&#x27;s library grows.
Please note that while the list below contains 10 entries, we aren’t actually ranking them – if a game has made it this far (and managed to stay here), it’s a must-play, period. As such, we’ll be listing entries in reverse chronological order. Also, you’ll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list. While those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences, they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if you’re alread…</span>

                    <span>It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on &quot;violations of the state&#x27;s civil rights and equal pay laws,&quot; specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.

                    <span>Halo Infinite’s campaign is finally out, as are the day one release notes. 
These notes detail install sizes, which don’t exceed 49 GB and could be much smaller if you already have multiplayer installed, and how to purchase and download the campaign if you haven’t yet already. It also lists out resolved issues, too, including the following: 
Local Area Network (LAN) multiplayer is now available, but one known issue is that match settings changed in the Mode Editor still show as default. However, once a match begins, the implemented settings will go into effect. 
Players with AMD Radeon RX 500 Series GPUs will no longer experience crashes as a result of having Async Compute turned on in Video Settings.

                    <span>Boy – you’re going to need a really powerful PC to run God of War at 4K/60FPS. 
Sony Santa Monica has released the specifications and requirements needed to play its 2018 hit title, God of War, on PC, and as expected, you’ll need quite a beefy machine. To even hit 4K/60FPS on PC, SMS recommends an Nvidia RTX 3080, which is the highly sought-after GPU that’s basically impossible to purchase at the moment. However, the recommended PC specs for God of War are a lot less taxing, needing only an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU and an Intel i5-6600K, amongst the usual requirements such as Windows 10. 
Here’s a full look at what you’ll need in your machine to play God of War at various visual fidelities, including minimum, recommended, high, performance, and ultra. 
The studio also released a new trailer showcasing some of what players can expect in the PC version of God of War, too.

Some PC-specific features include Nvidia DLSS AI Performance Boost, Nvidia Reflex, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, enhanced graphics, and more. 
“Higher-resolution shadows, improved screen space reflections, enhanced Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO) and Screen Space Directional Occlusion (SSDO), alongside highly detailed assets and rendering solutions means God of War on PC will be a beautiful, crisp visual experience,” SMS’ blog post reads. 
The PC version of God of War was announced in October, just over half a year after the PlayStation 5 update for God of War was revealed. That update brought 60 FPS, 4K Checkerboard Resolution, and 2160p resolutions to the game, and if you aren’t able to play it there, you can get similar performances soon when it hits PC on January 14 next year. For more, read about how God of War Ragnarok was delayed to 2022 earlier this year and then check out Game Informer’s God of War review after that.

                    <span>Super Smash Bros. series creator and Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai says that if he were to return to work on another game in the series, the roster would need to shrink and depend less on his vision for the franchise. 
Sakurai told The Verge this in a new post-Ultimate interview when asked if he could be convinced to come back for another Smash Bros. game. In November, Sakurai revealed that he’s not actively thinking about a sequel but that he wouldn’t rule one out. Sakurai still seems to be torn on whether or not a return to Smash Bros. is the right move for him, too, in The Verge’s interview with the famed director. 
“I think we’ve reached a limit, at least in terms of volume of content and fighters,” Sakurai said. “Basically, if I were to have the opportunity to work on another Sup…</span>

                    <span>Cue the gregorian chant. Tell your boss you’re sick. It’s finally time. Halo Infinite’s campaign is here, and to celebrate the momentous event, we’re streaming the first two hours of the game live on Twitch starting at 12:30 CT!

The return of Master Chief has long been both anticipated and given fans of the series anxiety after a controversial first showing and a subsequent delay. But those fearful of whether or not Infinite will be a return for form should rest easy. According to our very own Matt Miller, the latest Halo game sticks the landing. In his review, he says: 
Halo Infinite walks a narrow line between old and new and does it with as much success as I’ve seen from a game. As one of the most recognizable “feels” of play, it’s confidently nostalgic and rooted in an established legacy, ably recalling the earliest games in the series. Whether it’s the satisfying stick of a plasma grenade, the haughty cries of a sword-wielding stealth Elite, or the gradual discovery of a mysterious Halo ring, Infinite is an homage to Combat Evolved, 20 years after that first release. Simultaneously, 343 Industries’ new game charts its own course. Equipment like the incredibly satisfying grappleshot, open-world elements that inject increased opportunities for exploration, and freeform base assaults that challenge players to think creatively – all of these and more help the formula stay fresh and relevant. The balancing act works, and this is the best a Halo game has felt in over a decade.

Today we’ll be showing off the very first levels and playing for about two hours. We’ll be taking requests in chat and exploring the semi-open-world of the Zeta Halo, so be sure to swing by! If you’re stuck at work and can’t play the campaign right now, we have you covered. We got to go behind the scenes with 343 to learn a ton about multiplayer and campaign, and you can find all that excellent information in our vast cover hub!</span>

                    <span>A new poster for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie has been released, and as you might expect, it features Sonic, Tails, and Doctor Robotnik.
Jim Carrey’s Robotnik looks decidedly eggier compared to what we saw throughout most of the first Sonic movie. The official Sonic Movie Twitter account released this new poster, and it did so as a tease for what’s to come: the first trailer during tomorrow’s Game Awards show.

                    <span>Pokémon Unite will soon get into the holiday spirit when a new winter-themed event starts next week. 
Running from December 15 through January 16, this holiday festivities event will bring all sorts of gifts, limited licenses, trainer fashion items, and one new Pokémon to the game. Tsareena joined the roster today, and on December 20, Dragonite will enter the fray. Like Tsareena, the grass-type Pokémon introduced in Pokemon Sun and Moon, Dragonite will be a Melee All-Rounder character that “harnesses its impressive heft and draconic might to dole out maximum damage,” according to a new Pokémon Unite blog post.

The Contract is a free update that takes place a few years after the events of GTA V. After knocking over the Union Depository, Franklin has founded his own “celebrity solutions agency”: F. Clinton and Partner. His business aims to help Vinewood’s rich and famous solve their first-world problems, and Franklin needs a partner and a major client to get it off the ground.

                    <span>Paramount has released a new teaser for its upcoming Halo TV series. 
Released on Twitter, the teaser is just 15 seconds long, but only about half of it features footage from the actual show. The rest of the teaser is logos and title cards revealing more information, such as a “first look trailer” that’ll be shown during The Game Awards 2021 tomorrow. 
Gear up, Spartans. We’ll see you at @thegameawards on Thursday. #HaloTheSeries pic.twitter.com/QzWcp971Em
December 7, 2021
As you can see in the trailer above, we get brief glimpses of some Spartans and UNSC soldiers. It looks like some are carrying Battle Rifles, Snipers, and maybe even Assault Rifles. We also spotted the iconic Pelican vehicle in the background of that first hangar bay shot and a couple of Warthogs in the third shot of actual footage. 
While there’s still no word on what we can genuinely expect in this Halo TV series, it’s clear the production team behind it is putting extra care into everything. However, the showrunner has revealed that the team “want[s] to do something new” with the series, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect a retelling of the campaigns we’ve already played through in the Halo series. 
While waiting to see the full trailer during tomorrow’s Game Awards show, catch up on all of the teasers released so far. In November of last year, a small Master Chief helmet teaser was released, and then another teaser – the first official one – was released just last month during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Showcase. After watching those, read about how this series has cast Jen Taylor, the voice of Cortana in the video games, to voice Cortana. 
Halo will launch on Paramount+ in 2022.

                    <span>Fortnite Chapter 3 launched a few days ago and it introduced Spider-Man, a newly redesigned island, sliding and swinging mechanics, camps, and more. One more thing related to Chapter 3 has now been revealed, a couple of days later: Fornite is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. 
Announced on Twitter by the official Unreal Engine Twitter account, Epic Games is flipping from Unreal Engine 4 to 5 with the arrival of Chapter 3.
With the arrival of Chapter 3, @FortniteGame development has flipped to Unreal Engine 5.
December 7, 2021
As for right now, this change shouldn’t mean much – what you’re playing today is Fortnite, through and through. However, through Unreal Engine 5, we might one day see a massive graphical boost in the battle royale. Plus, as Epic devs learn the upgraded engine, other substantial technical changes might come to Fortnite. 
If Unreal Engine 5 sounds unfamiliar to you, there’s a chance you might be more familiar with last year’s stunning PlayStation 5 real-time demo that ran using the engine. You can watch it below.

Theoretically, Fortnite could look as great as that demo one day. Of course, Fortnite has its own art style so it likely won’t look like that demo, but it serves as a showcase for what developers can do with Unreal Engine 5 and if that’s just a taste, we’re excited to see what Epic Games does with its battle royale. 
If you’re especially excited about that demo, you can buy a Fortnite skin for the character shown in it. We’ll all get a taste of Unreal Engine 5 tomorrow thanks to the upcoming Matrix Awakens experience that’s now available to pre-load on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and if you don’t own one of those consoles, don’t sweat it – more information about it will be released at tomorrow’s Game Awards show.

                    <span>&quot;What games should I get for my PlayStation 5?&quot; This is the question we&#x27;ve been asked the most since Sony&#x27;s new generation of gaming arrived last November. People want to see what games are the best showpieces of PlayStation 5&#x27;s power, and also which ones take their beloved medium to new heights. Although the PlayStation 5 is still young, it has already amassed a nice library of games, including a few titles that you can&#x27;t play anywhere else.
The Game Informer staff has selected 10 games that we consider to be the PlayStation 5&#x27;s absolute best. Over time, this article will be updated with the latest releases that we think crack the top 10.

                    <span>Git gud games.
When Dark Souls launched back in 2011, it ushered in a new era of lore-filled and inscrutable combat-focused games that gave players the freedom to follow their own path and play style, but steadfastly refused to &#x27;go easy&#x27; on them. Every encounter in FromSoftware&#x27;s series, no matter how minor, has the potential to end in tears; if you blunder in mindlessly mashing buttons, you will be punished.

What defines a &#x27;Soulslike&#x27;, though? It&#x27;s not just difficulty, although that&#x27;s a part of it. Games that exhibit Dark Souls-style elements demand concentration and intent if you want to overcome the challenges they present. They can be 3D or 2D (side-on or top-down), but they typically include exacting combat against unforgiving enemies, large boss fights, the loss of reclaimable &#x27;essence&#x27; or similar currency on death, and the freedom to explore different areas of the map — with your skill often being the only gate to progress down a specific path. Bonfires — or equivalent &#x27;safe&#x27; zones that offer respite and restoration — are another key part of the Souls experience; that tension of risk vs. reward while inching through an enemy-filled environment on just a sliver of health, desperately hoping to find a bonfire around the next corner.

                    <span>Switch: The Final Frontier.
Astroneer is a brilliant little base-building space exploration game with literal hidden depths, as you explore the network of procedurally-generated caves beneath your base, and harvest minerals with your handy terraforming gun.
Once you&#x27;ve managed to settle your home planet, it&#x27;s time to build a rocket and blast off to new planets, with more dangerous flora, harsher climates, and — to make it all worth it — rare new elements to harvest.

                    <span>For you physical collectors.
Among Us emerged as a smash hit in 2020 and has continued that momentum this year, with frequent updates and releases on more platforms - including Switch in late 2020, of course. Considering its humble origins it&#x27;s had a rapid expansion of merchandise, too, and the first of the collector&#x27;s physical editions is also rolling out soon.
Among Us: Crewmate Edition has always been pegged for 14th December in Europe, but was expected in North America in January. The good news is that developer Innersloth, along with its partners at Maximum Games and Dual Wield Studio, has been able to bring the North American release forward to 21st December, so pre-orders should arrive in time for Christmas.

                    <span>I know how you feel.
It’s hard to believe that we’re now on the fourth Life is Strange game in just six years (fifth if you include the short introductory installment for Life is Strange 2). That’s a lot of content within a relatively short space of time, so there’s an undeniable danger of the series running out of steam. Thankfully, however, Life is Strange: True Colors is confidently the most accomplished game of the series so far, showcasing a likable cast of characters, a well-written narrative, and a fantastic soundtrack.
Life is Strange: True Colors stars Alex Chen (played marvelously by Erika Mori) who moves to the quaint mining town of Haven Springs after a lengthy stint in foster care. Reuniting with her brother Gabe, it soon becomes evident that Alex harbors a secret ability to sense strong emotions in others, thus causing the same emotion — whether it be happiness, fear, or anger — to manifest in Alex herself.

                    <span>&quot;I’ve been doing too much of the work myself&quot;.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with its &#x27;everyone is here&#x27; approach, concluded with an enormous roster and amount of content. It was already a huge game on release, but a DLC program that rolled out over the course of three years expanded it further, in addition to the various free updates and mode additions.
As has been well recorded, series lead and figurehead Masahiro Sakurai has been enjoying a well-earned rest since development concluded, but the topic of &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; is still following him around. In an interview with The Verge, Sakurai-san talked about his recent opportunities to unwind, the amount of work and depth that was applied to each DLC addition, and of course the future.

We&#x27;ve written about Arcade Paradise a few times this year, and now publisher Wired Productions - along with developer Nosebleed Interactive - has released a new trailer and confirmed more details. For one thing it&#x27;s due in Spring 2022, having at one point been planned for late this year.
It&#x27;s a game that leans heavily on &#x27;90s arcade culture - which could definitely be rather fun - as you try to run a laundromat while simultaneously converting it into a rad arcade. A big part of the game, seemingly, is that you&#x27;ll be able to play the 30+ arcades, which will be games riffing on that era.

Mai Shiranui is one of the most famous characters to emerge from SNK&#x27;s Fatal Fury and King of Fighters series, for reasons we&#x27;re still a bit fuzzy on, even after all these years.
Perhaps it&#x27;s her winning smile? Or that lovely, flowing hair? Maybe it&#x27;s her boundless enthusiasm for the cooling powers of the traditional paper fan? Whatever the reason for her seemingly timeless appeal with the male of the species, we&#x27;re stumped. Your guess is as good as ours!

Following on from recent news that Tails voice actor Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey will be once again voicing Miles Prower in the upcoming Sonic movie, the poster for sequel has been revealed, and it appropriately references another Sonic the Hedgehog 2 — some might say the real Sonic 2.
Unveiled on Twitter, the new poster (below) features Sonic, Tails and Robotnik — as played by the returning Jim Carrey — flying high above the land in Sonic&#x27;s biplane, the Tornado, first seen in the original Mega Drive / Genesis sequel. You can see a few Eggman&#x27;s drones giving chase as the sun rises in the East... or perhaps the shot is pointing south and the sun&#x27;s setting in the West? Either way, it&#x27;s nice-looking.

Notable for being one of the first arcade games to fuse RPG elements with the ability to select your level based on a world map, Dragon Buster followed in the footsteps of Namco&#x27;s similarly influential coin-op Tower of Druaga and includes many other innovations, such as the ability to dash and double-jump.

As you&#x27;re no doubt aware, Christina Aguilera has been giving Nintendo a bit of publicity recently, starring in a commercial with her family and talking about the topic in an interview with Elle (which admittedly got ignored in gaming circles for a good while). We learned that being famous can get you an early look at Pokémon Legends: Arceus, for example.
But we couldn&#x27;t let that interview drift fully into the internet distant past without highlighting one more section — Christina Aguilera shows the love for Wario and Waluigi. She was asked about her favourite characters and made the correct call:

For a good while Nintendo has been producing &#x27;Monthly Rewind&#x27; videos in which a very energetic voice-over walks us through key releases and moments from the last month. The November iteration has arrived and serves as a reminder that it was a pretty notable month for the Switch (and mobile gets a mention too).
Of course Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a major headline, along with Pokémon Unite&#x27;s updates, and it also highlights that we had substantial updates to existing games - both free and paid - that gave them extra life. We were big fans of Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Happy Home Paradise in particular. Some pretty decent eShop titles get shown off too, from high profile IPs to the distinctly bonkers DEEEER Simulator: Your Average Everyday Deer Game.

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have been the tentpole Switch releases for the Holiday shopping season, with early sales data in countries like Japan and the UK pointing to positive results. Now it&#x27;s been reported by Gamebiz.jp that the releases passed six million sales globally in their launch week, which is hugely impressive.
As a broad number that&#x27;s in the same ballpark as Sword and Shield&#x27;s equivalent results, which suggests that the remakes have held a similar appeal to the previous new-gen releases. That&#x27;s notable, considering that this figure is a good bit above (about double) the equivalent launch sales for Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu! and Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!.

                    <span>Breeding virtual monsters to fight for fun and profit.
Name the first classic game series that centres around collecting, training, and battling monsters against other trainers around the continent that comes into your head. No, we’re not talking about Pokémon — instead we’re looking at Monster Rancher, a series which started in 1997 on the PlayStation and turns 25 next year. So what better way to celebrate that quarter-century than to catch the first two games re-released for Switch? Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX is certainly one of the more unusual games on Switch eShop.
Monster Rancher, like many series coming out of Japan in the &#x27;90s, has a somewhat spotty localisation history. In fact, this is the first time that the original game has ever reached Europe, with the sequel marking the series&#x27; debut in that territory (dropping the titular &#x27;2&#x27; so as not to confuse Europeans). Monster Rancher 1 &amp; 2 DX is a pretty faithful port of the first two games, adding in a few quality of life improvements that weren’t a part of the original Western release — such as more save slots and monsters to raise — while keeping the gameplay, sound, and graphics straight out of the PS1 era.

The Switch has a handful of excellent music rhythm games with various hooks and game styles that shake things up. Overpass: Rhythm Roadtrip - published by Quantum Astrophysicists Guild and developed by Studio Bean - is aiming to make its own mark on the genre, targeting a release on Switch and other platforms in 2022.
As you can see in the trailer it goes for a slightly different approach, with the viewpoint dreamily gazing out of the window of a car - it&#x27;s all in the name, to be fair. Symbols for inputs are blended into the environment, which will hopefully be easy to parse and see when actually playing, though that is also part of the challenge; you can see some official details below.

                    <span>Believes a Game Awards appearance is perhaps too soon.
Over the past few weeks, some Nintendo fans on social media have convinced themselves that one &quot;world premiere&quot; we&#x27;ll be getting at this year&#x27;s Game Awards is tied to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel.
It all stems from a tweet by the host and organiser Geoff Keighley - mentioning how &quot;honored&quot; he was to reveal a project that he&#x27;s been working on with a developer for 2.5 years. The &quot;hype&quot; has since snowballed, but before you get too excited, you might want to read on...

It&#x27;s been a while since we got an update about the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie, but today we&#x27;ve got some exciting news.
Tails&#x27; voice actor has been officially confirmed as Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey. The talent has already been voicing the character for many years and will now also be voicing him in Sonic&#x27;s second movie outing. She&#x27;ll join Ben Schwartz as Sonic, and Idris Elba as Knuckles.

                    <span>The next patch for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is a big one: 78GB big. Ubisoft today announced that next week&#x27;s patch &quot;will &quot;will require players to re-download the entire game as part of a data restructuring.&quot; The whole base game, downloaded all over again. It&#x27;s for a good cause, at least. This should make the game load faster and generally run better, which is a nice change for a game to still have the motivation to deliver a year after launch, but maybe not such welcome news if you&#x27;re on a slow, throttled, or metered connection.

Well, they still haven&#x27;t announced more singleplayer GTAV, but today they did announce one of the singleplayer stars will return in multiplayer. The next GTA Online update, named The Contract, will focus on campaign co-star Franklin, now running a &#x27;fixer&#x27; agency and needs our help dealing with a big client, Dr. Dre. Yup, it&#x27;s the D-R-E, and he&#x27;s bringing unreleased new music with him.

The servers have been overwhelmed since early access began last week and the thirst for furry friends in maid outfits simply won’t abate. Not only do the long login queues persist now it&#x27;s out properly, but there are plenty of errors plaguing the process which makes the wait even more frustrating. Thankfully, an update is being deployed today that should fix those server errors, increase server capacity, and make the login process a bit smoother.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t agree that being mean is always the funniest joke, but it is often the easiest joke, and let&#x27;s keep that in mind as we talk about next year&#x27;s Mario movie. You know, the one where Mario will be played by Chris Pratt. In the event that the film turns out to be good, I will enjoy it - like how the Sonic film was actually pretty decent, especially James Marsden&#x27;s star turn. But for now, Untitled Chris Pratt Mario Movie is bad, and a guilt-free laugh.

One of the square on the bingo card is &quot;Jump by Kriss Kross plays&quot; and someone else says they think it&#x27;s &quot;50/50 they choose Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot; over Kriss Kross&quot;, which leads yet a third person to bring up House Of Pain. From this exchange I am 100% sure that a jump-themed song will feature in this film - but the question is which?

                    <span>Ahead of God of War coming to PC on January 14th, an Nvidia blog post has laid bare the enhancements you can expect from the port, as well as the PC system requirements. In fairness it looks like a pretty comprehensive effort, combining expected tweaks like 21:9 ultrawide monitor support with performance-boosting Nvidia DLSS upscaling and even some general graphical upgrades. There’s a PC features trailer, too.

                    <span>Watch out if you&#x27;re looking forward to playing Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign tonight - you&#x27;ll need to install the game after it goes live. Unlike most other big games this year, Infinite has no preload option, so you won&#x27;t be able to have it downloaded and ready to go by the time it launches. Though, developers 343 Industries say you can make the download a little smaller by having the FPS&#x27;s multiplayer beta installed.

                    <span>Back when erstwhile PlayStation exclusive Horizon Zero Dawn launched on PC last year, it was a bit of a lucky dip whether you got a smooth-running port or a constantly crashing mess. These days, though, the PC version is in far better shape, and has just today received a major upgrade in the form of support for Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super-Sampling) and AMD FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution).

Ricochet Anti-Cheat&#x27;s kernel-level driver also arrives to further combat those pesky cheats.

                    <span>Halo Infinite comes out today! That&#x27;s fun. What&#x27;s slightly less fun, however, is that you won&#x27;t be able to replay story missions. Microsoft have said that, while you can keep exploring the game&#x27;s open world after you finish it, main campaign missions won&#x27;t be available to repeat. Fortunately, this shouldn&#x27;t be the case forever, because 343 Industries say that replayability is &quot;being worked on&quot;, though they don&#x27;t have a date for it just yet. (Mild spoilers for Infinite&#x27;s campaign below).

                    <span>There once was a time when buying a new gaming monitor was all about pushing toward a higher resolution. But priorities have shifted over the years, and while yes, it&#x27;s nice to play a game at a crisp 1440p or 4K, what&#x27;s equally important is that your game looks smooth and feels responsive. This is where refresh rates and response times come in, making your games flow better and feel more reactive. This is especially important in fast-paced multiplayer games, where a slick and accurate display can mean this between hitting your target and missing them.

It&#x27;s always nice to be pleasantly surprised by new games I didn&#x27;t expect to play (or had no plans to buy outright). Microsoft have detailed a bunch more games I&#x27;ll likely be surprised by coming to Xbox Game Pass for PC when they launch over the next year or so - from epic space RPG Starfield, to Arkane&#x27;s vampire hunting adventure Redfall. It looks like they&#x27;re revealing more later this week too.

O&#x27;Shaughnessey revealed the casting news on Twitter this afternoon saying, &quot;Taking my old pal Tails for another adventure. Thrilled to announce I’m the voice of Miles “Tails” Prower in #SonicMovie2! Can’t wait for y&#x27;all to see him on the big screen.&quot;

December 7, 2021
She joins stars Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Jim Carrey (Dr. Ivo Robotnik), and James Marsden (Donut Lord... ahem. I mean Tom Wachowski), who will reprise their roles from the first film. Idris Elba is, of course voicing Knuckles the Echidna to round out the trio of animated characters we know of so far. O&#x27;Shaughnessey also played Tails in the brief stinger featured at the end 2020&#x27;s adaptation.
Colleen has been the voice of Tails for quite a few years, first stepping into the flying fox&#x27;s shoes since 2013 games Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystals. Prior to that, she was the voice of Knuckles Chaotix alum Charmy Bee before also taking on the role of Sonic&#x27;s stalwart partner.
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is slated to hit theaters on April, 8 2022.
We&#x27;re coming up on the end of Sonic&#x27;s 30th anniversary, and while we know a new game is in the works, there&#x27;s not much info out about it.

                    <span>When The Last Night premiered during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 2017 presentation, its cyberpunk-flavored blend of 3D graphics and pixel art dazzled audiences. Unfortunately, developer Odd Tales has hit a lot of roadblocks since then, including losing its publishing partner and raising funding on its own. The Last Night has since occupied the “whatever happened to that game?” bingo card, but it appears Odd Tale is busy prepping to reintroduce the game in the foreseeable future. 
PC Gamer spoke with The Last Night’s creator, Tim Soret, via email last week regarding rumors that the game will appear during The Game Awards on December 9. Soret dismissed these rumors as just that, saying “...The Last Night will be shown next year, not before.&quot; He doesn’t commit to saying the game will launch in 2022, explaining that he wants to avoid putting pressure on his small team and that they’re carefully building The Last Night “brick by brick” to adapt the game’s visuals for current-gen as well as implementing a suite of accessibility options.
&quot;What we know is that for The Last Night comeback in 2022, we make it our mission to blow everyone away by the strength &amp; originality of our proposition.&quot; says Soret. You can watch the original debut trailer for a reminder of why people really want The Last Night to release.

The Last Night was originally intended to launch in 2018, but Odd Tales split from publisher Raw Fury. Although Odd Tales regained full publishing rights to the game, the divorce seemingly triggered an avalanche of funding and legal issues the team stated it couldn’t publically speak on. Odd Tales even said it had to cancel a trailer intended for the 2018 Game Awards. The Last Night has clearly been through the wringer, but it’s refreshing to hear that it may be climbing out of development hell sooner rather than later.
The Last Night is slated to launch on Xbox One and PC.

Final Fantasy XIV is teaming up with GrubHub to offer a new “Eat Pizza” emote for those that use Grubhub’s delivery service from December 9 to December 15. And with all that time you spend waiting in queue to play, you’re sure to work up a powerful appetite! The first 20,000 orders that redeem the code ENDWALKER at checkout not only get the emote, but they also get free delivery on the order (up to $6).
All participants get the Eat Pizza emote on December 17th, which can then be redeemed on a Final Fantasy XIV account. You could probably get a code and give it to a friend for the holidays or something, given how this works after you order food. Even though the emote is pizza-related, you can order anything (as long as the order is over $15) for the purposes of scoring the emote code. As you may be playing Final Fantasy XIV, I’d recommend something that won’t get your controller or mouse greasy. The emote itself is sure to be the height of fashion in all those new Endwalker dungeons and raids. You can check out the full promotion details here.
Have you been playing Endwalker? Are you trying out the Reaper or the Sage? Is a pizza emote an awesome addition to the cool actions you can do in-game, a sign of the apocalypse, or just something to do between feeding your Chocobo? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop updates every Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT with new items that players can purchase with credits. Since the launch of the free-to-play multiplayer component, 343 Industries has updated the shop four times. The latest rotation brings a pricey legendary bundle, as well as the goofiest item yet: a flower to fasten to your Spartans helmet.
The biggest bundle this week is the Soldier Armor Set for the Mark VII. In the bundle, you will find the epic Tac/Liberty Rig, Tahuna Sands armor coating, sleek soldier helmet design, a variety of attachments including the Mithril visor, and last but not least, the Rocket Rescue stance. This set retails for 2,000 credits, which players can purchase for $17.99.
If you don&#x27;t want your Spartan to look overly serious, you can purchase the Daisy Delights bundle to add a small stuffed bear to the chest plate and a flower to the helmet. If you want to wear two flowers at once, you can swap out the bear for a yellow rose. This bundle is 1,500 credits.
And who doesn&#x27;t like pickles? The final bundle called Special Delivery offers a Space Pickle charm, a gold Legend visor (which looks a lot like Master Chief&#x27;s), and the Into the Breach stance. The final item offered this week is the Chibi Chieftain bundle, which adds cute decals of alien characters to your vehicles, nameplate, weapons, and armor.</span>

                    <span>Everyone&#x27;s favorite grumpy orange cartoon cat Garfield is coming to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl on December 9. He&#x27;ll be available for free on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC this week, with his addition to the Switch version coming later this month (also for free), according to IGN.

Garfield, known for taking naps and loving Italian food, is bringing a move list inspired by his comic strip and cartoons. The reveal trailer shows him donning a top hat and cane, scarfing lasagna, and going feral with some wild cat scratches. He&#x27;s also showing an appropriate amount of sass, which I appreciate. We&#x27;ll have to wait for the full character breakdown for his release this week to find out if he&#x27;s any good. Though, Garfield has to be at least ready for this type of game since he&#x27;s been edgeguarding Odie for 40 years.
I reviewed Nick Brawl in October, where I found it to be a solid yet flawed platform fighter. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the review: 
Garfield looks to be the first of two free characters coming to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, with another unknown combatant coming sometime in the future. Developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs are also planning paid DLC fighters down the road. 
Are you looking forward to taking control of Garfield and terrorizing the competition? Who is your favorite voice for the feline, and why is the rendition from Garfield and Friends? Tell us in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Update, 12/7/2021:
Nick Offerman has been cast as Bill in HBO&#x27;s upcoming The Last of Us TV series, which is an adaptation of the PlayStation-exclusive game of the same name.
Previously, it was revealed that Con O&#x27;Neill had been cast as Bill, leading to widespread circulation yesterday as for who Offerman might be playing (many thought he&#x27;d make a good Bill but the role was already cast). However, a new report from Variety reveals that Offerman will, in fact, play Bill in HBO&#x27;s series after O&#x27;Neill had to drop out from the show due to a scheduling conflict.

                    <span>Yesterday, employees at Raven Software staged a walk-out protesting last week&#x27;s surprise layoffs of a dozen of its QA department contractors. The terminations created an uproar within the Call of Duty support studio, as the firings affected a reported third of its entire QA team. Furthermore, several terminated employees had recently been hired and relocated to the studio’s Madison, Wisconsin office – in some instances, out of their own pockets. The protests continue today, and workers at other Activision Blizzard offices have joined in.
 It is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is …</span>

                    <span>Playdead has seemingly released a new image from its third game in development, which goes by the name Game 3 as it does not yet have a formal title. 
Playdead is one of the most intriguing developers in games and in no small part due to the mystery around their games. It isn’t a very public studio, opting to tease out an image here or there rather than a full blog post with trailers and more like many others in the industry. And it’s seemingly not beholden to any kind of timelines...because the studio just releases games when it wants to, and it works – both Limbo and Inside reviewed really well, especially here at Game Informer. 
That mystique around Playdead remains with the studio&#x27;s third game in development. The latest look at Game 3 comes by way of a tweet advertising jobs available …</span>

                    <span>Bungie’s 30th Anniversary Event in Destiny 2 has begun and a new trailer released today showcases some of the loot inspired by the studio’s history that will be available in-game. 
When you think of Bungie, there’s a good chance either Destiny pops into your head or Halo, and rightfully so – it’s the two properties the studio is best known for creating. Bungie split from Microsoft back in 2007 to become independent, something Xbox head Phil Spencer doesn’t think would have happened in today’s Xbox ecosystem, and after over half a decade, it released Destiny.
A sequel was released in 2017, aptly titled Destiny 2, and that’s the studio’s main bread and butter at this point.

                    <span>Ubisoft has announced its first step into bringing NFTs and blockchain technology into its games with the beta release of the Ubisoft Quartz platform. Starting on December 9, 12, and 15, Ghost Recon Breakpoint for PC will receive the first round of Digits, Ubisoft&#x27;s name for playable, in-game NFTs.
Quartz is a mobile app that will facilitate the connection between the goods in your digital wallets and Ubisoft&#x27;s games that will use the NFT cosmetics called Digits. It&#x27;s considered a test of the technology right now, but eventually, Ubisoft&#x27;s goal is to have these Digits move from game to game, allowing players to use and show off their unique gear outside of Breakpoint.

                    <span>Spiritfarer is getting the final batch of content from its 2021 roadmap, and developer Thunder Lotus bills it as the most significant addition yet. Jackie and Daria are two new spirits joining the fray alongside an uncharted island to explore and a new event. 
The free update arrives on December 13 for all versions of the game. The story sees Stella visit a rundown hospital situated on an unknown island. She meets Jackie, a caretaker and spirit in the form of a hyena, and Daria, a bat and Jackie’s patient. By befriending these two lovable spirits, you’ll help them get the hospital up and running again. As seen in the trailer below, the update adds a new platforming-focused event, and you outfit your ferry with new upgrades.

As previously noted, the Jackie &amp; Daria update will be the game’s last. Two previous add-ons introduced two other spirits, Lily and Beverly, and their respective stories. Now that Spiritfaer is wrapped up, we look forward to seeing what Thunder Lotus has up its sleeve next. 
Spiritfarer is available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. You can read our review here to find out why it’s a gem you shouldn’t overlook.</span>

                    <span>You should really savor and enjoy the campaign missions you play in Halo Infinite when 343 Industries’ latest sci-fi shooter goes live tomorrow because it’ll be the only time you can play them on that save file. 
That’s because you won’t be able to replay campaign story missions in Halo Infinite on a save file where you’ve already played said campaign story missions. In order to replay campaign missions, you’ll need to start a fresh save. This might be frustrating for completionists as the campaign missions feature collectibles that are easy to miss. If you miss one, you won’t be able to go back and get it after you beat the mission. However, 343 Industries told The Verge that it’s looking to change that.

“We haven’t announced a date but that is being worked on,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker told The Verge. “We want to have replay that works well, and when you have a more open game, it gets a lot trickier. So we made a decision to improve the quality of the single-player campaign to ensure that, as a foundation, that it’s as strong as it possibly could be so that we could then add the other features back in.” 
If you’re looking to 100% Halo Infinite and unlock all of the campaign-related achievements in your first playthrough, it sounds like you might want to keep a guide handy just in case.

This collection, which bundles together remastered versions of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy for PlayStation 5, will launch on January 28, according to a new PlayStation Blog post. The collection is also coming to PC but PlayStation said more details about the release date for that version will come at a later date. To celebrate news of the collection’s release date, PlayStation has released a new trailer showcasing some of the new and beautiful visuals coming to Lost Legacy and A Thief’s End.

                    <span>Final Fantasy XIV’s growth doesn’t seem to be slowing down as more people are actively registered to play it than ever before. 
What started as a failure, causing the team at Square Enix to completely revamp and relaunch the game, has grown to become one of the most successful MMOs on the market. Final Fantasy XIV’s growth has led to 25 million registered players, up from 24 million back in October, as reported by Eurogamer.

This number could rise even more today as the latest expansion, Endwalker, is finally out after launching into early access last week. Hopefully, those players have been paying attention to the information the team behind Final Fantasy XIV has been releasing because the MMO’s servers are currently congested, with some players hitting queue lines as long as 5000-plus players. 
The team is giving all registered players and those who own Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for all of the server congestion. The onset of Endwalker has also led to Final Fantasy XIV garnering its largest concurrent player base ever. As noted by Eurogamer, the peak concurrent for the MMO hit an all-time high two days ago, reaching 95,000 concurrent players, according to SteamDB. The previous record happened in July, and it was nearly 30,000 less at 67,000. With Endwalker’s launch happening today, we wouldn’t be surprised if a new concurrent record is reached (assuming the servers can keep up). 
While waiting to queue into Endwalker, check out Game Informer’s Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker New Gameplay Today, and then check out this new trailer for the expansion. Read about how the team is still working to bring Final Fantasy XIV to Xbox after that.

Eurogamer noted the release times for Halo Infinite’s launch tomorrow, and due to the global launch nature, the latest sci-fi shooter from 343 Industries will launch early in the day in some places and much later in the day in others. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect:

Just when I thought I&#x27;d seen everything Star Wars had to offer, Zynga introduces one of the strangest ideas yet: a Jawa standing on his brother&#x27;s shoulders to create a tall fighter named Utooni. This puzzling creation is just one of the many combatants in Zynga&#x27;s Star Wars: Hunters, a Switch and mobile game that is slated to release next year.
Star Wars: Hunters is a free-to-play multiplayer game that takes some real chances with its roster. You won&#x27;t see recognizable characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, or Boba Fett battling to the death. Zynga is instead making its own lineup of warriors from the Outer Rim. Another odd one is named Slingshot, which just happens to be a droideka piloted by an Ugnaught. There&#x27;s also a droid named J-3DI, which t…</span>

                    <span>Also you have to actually play Ring Fit.
Nintendo&#x27;s been ramping up the adverts in preparation for the Christmas rush, but what about the post-Christmas &quot;oh no, I ate too many mince pies&quot; slim-down? Well, we have Ring Fit Adventure, of course, which is available again after that early pandemic rush.
But the advert for &quot;Buy Ring Fit To Work Off Those Christmas Calories&quot; isn&#x27;t filmed yet. Casting agency Kate And Lou + Ro Casting is currently looking for &quot;people who enjoy incorporating Ring Fit into their at home exercise routine, and from families who enjoy playing and exercising together using Ring Fit&quot; to film an advert at their own house.

                    <span>An hour of Animal Crossing chat!
It&#x27;s been a month since Animal Crossing: New Horizons got that stonking big update, plus the double stonking Happy Home Paradise DLC that none of us could have predicted. When the game first came out, albeit in much weirder pandemic-beginning-times than the update, most of us were guzzling it up for at least the first month or two — so what happened this time?
We smushed together Zion from the video team and Kate from the writing team to discuss their thoughts, feelings, and discoveries made while playing the update and the DLC. Also, because both of them are very chatty and easily distracted, they also discuss hats, chocolate, and secret toilets.

                    <span>Here are some Nowimages.
There are a lot of 2D &#x27;Metroidvanias&#x27; kicking around, but there&#x27;s a reason for that - they&#x27;re often enjoyable and the better entries in the genre can be top-notch experiences. Another that&#x27;s heading to Switch in late 2022 is Afterimage, which is the work of developer Aurogon Shanghai.
It has some extremely handsome hand-drawn visuals, with the hope being that it&#x27;ll optimise well for Nintendo&#x27;s system - we do have some gorgeous 2D titles on the Switch already. The concept and setting look rather promising, and you can see some of the official details and screens below.

                    <span>And what a wild ride it&#x27;s been.
Three years ago today, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched worldwide on Nintendo Switch. And what a game it turned out to be, huh?
With its constant character reveals, Nintendo Direct showcases, and internet memes aplenty, few games have had quite the impact on the gaming community that Ultimate has in recent times. While the game itself is brilliant fun, and objectively an impressive piece of work from a development and licensing point of view, we can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s everything surrounding the game – all of the hype, rumours, &quot;leaks&quot;, and discussion – that will really help Ultimate to stand out in the years to come.

After diving deep into the new Minecraft Caves and Cliffs Part II update (all the way down to Y-64), our resident Minecraft expert Kate Gray is ready to declare her verdict on the whole thing. Do new caves and cliffs make that much of a difference to a game that&#x27;s all about caves and cliffs? Read on to find out...

There&#x27;s an interesting phenomenon that I&#x27;ve observed with Minecraft. I keep dragging my friends into the game to build little towns with me, and every time, they can&#x27;t help remarking that &quot;things have changed so much&quot; since they last played. Everyone seems to have had a Minecraft phase, and that phase was often a few years back — before the Nether was added, or before axolotls — so, when they come to the game in 2021, everything is glorious, new, and incredibly confusing.

Lasagne-lovin&#x27;, Monday-hatin&#x27; orange cat Garfield has been confirmed as the latest edition to the Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl character roster.
Arriving as a free update for anybody who bought the game, Garfield joins the likes of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, Nigel Thornberry, Ren &amp; Stimpy and more.

                    <span>I fell mushy, gooey, sweaty in love with Thirty Flights Of Loving from the first time I played it. It&#x27;s a rapid-fire, magical realistic heist game, which tells its short story using smash cuts, flashbacks, and no dialogue.

It is now nine years old, and so of course it&#x27;s received a 9th anniversary update. It has been &quot;updated for modern operating systems&quot;, with menu, HUD and UI fixes, and Mac and Linux ports. Lovely.

Earlier this year, Nvidia began enabling Resizable BAR on their GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs and laptops, with the promise of faster frame rates for no additional expense. But what exactly is Resizable BAR, and assuming you have compatible hardware, is it really worth switching on?

The fourth expansion pack for Square Enix&#x27;s fantasy MMORPG continues the story with new quests, adds two new player classes, takes us to new areas to fight new enemies, and, most importantly, opens a male option for the Viera race so you can play as a bunnyboy in a maid costume. Yeah, thirst for those bunnyboys will only make the queues longer.

                    <span>More than 60 developers at Call Of Duty: Warzone studio Raven Software reportedly held a walkout yesterday to protest Activision laying off quality assurance testers. On Friday, the studio let 12 contractors go due to restructuring, which is said to be around a third of the QA team.


&quot;This has not only destroyed the morale of our workforce, but obliterated trust in the company that has been routinely asking us for patience in improving our work lives,&quot; said employee group ABetterABK.

The team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S. As more games come out, we&#x27;ll update this list with the latest releases that we feel deserve to crack the top 10.

                    <span>Solar Ash is a great game that cherry-picks ideas from Jet Set Radio, Shadow of the Colossus, and Super Mario Galaxy. However, only one series came to mind as I skated across its teal clouds: Sonic the Hedgehog. More specifically, the 3D entries, which are the oft-maligned titles responsible for decades of headaches for the Blue Blur. 
I’ll admit that I’m a Sonic traditionalist. My love of Sonic, like many other 30-somethings, began on the Sega Genesis, so I firmly believe the character is at his best in 2D. Sonic 2 is my favorite in the series and Sonic Mania, the 2017 throwback developed by a team of fans rather than Sonic Team proper, is the best entry in years. 
The 3D installments have never gotten Sonic right. Yes, even the Adventure series, which I respect but still maintain are bad…</span>

The statement can be read below:
&quot;Activision Publishing is growing its overall investment in its development and operations resources. We are converting approximately 500 temporary workers to full-time employees in the coming months.

                    <span>The first game from Embark Studios, a veteran team led by former EA and Dice head Patrick Söderlund, is set to be revealed this week. The game is called Arc Raiders, and we got a glimpse of what to expect in a cryptic teaser video.
The video is one of those “trailer for the trailer” as it states a full reveal is slated for Thursday, December 9. Hey, that’s the same day as The Game Awards — what a funny coincidence. The video shows some third-person shooting, a woman calling for volunteers, and an “Enlist. Resist” tagline. You can watch the teaser in the tweet below.

December 6, 2021
We first caught wind of Embark’s new game last November, when the studio began hiring for a PvP team-based shooter and shared concept art of the project. It seems safe to assume that Arc Raiders is this project, but we’ll find out for sure soon enough. Embark was formed in 2018 after Söderlund departed EA earlier that same year. The team is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and boasts roughly 200 employees as of November 2020. The company’s mission statement, according to its website, is “to blur the line between playing and making,” and many of the posts have centered on showcasing development tools.
What do you think about this first tease for Arc Raiders? Any guesses as to what kind of game it could be? Share your thoughts in the comments!</span>

                    <span>With the world&#x27;s return to The Matrix franchise a couple of weeks away (the time it would take to download a movie on Limewire in the early 2000s), Epic Games is releasing a new experience built on its new engine. Partnering with the cast and crew from the upcoming film, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will show off what the new software can do.

The Matrix Resurrections director Lana Wachowski is involved in bringing this tech showcase to life, and so are the film&#x27;s stars, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who provide performances for Awakens. The trailer for the Unreal experience is exceptionally short, only providing a couple of seconds of Reeves doing what&#x27;s demanded of him in a bright white void: questioning existence, asking, &quot;How do we know what is real,&quot; which is a question that&#x27;s probably pointed at his own physical being in the trailer, a near-lifelike recreation of the well-known actor. Or else he&#x27;s messing with us, and that is actually Keanu on film. To that, I say, kudos for making me question three seconds of footage all day.
The Matrix Awakens is available now to pre-load on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stay tuned for more info on the experience at The Game Awards this Thursday.

                    <span>A senior executive at Sony was fired after being caught in an alleged pedophile sting video posted online. 
George Cacioppo was a senior vice president of engineering for Sony for over eight years, having worked on products such as the PlayStation Store and more. Over the weekend, the amateur pedophile-busting YouTube channel People v. Preds posted a video online that accused him of trying to meet with a 15-year-old boy. After the video began to pick up steam, Sony told CNET that Cacioppo had been fired. 
“We are aware of the situation and the employee in question has been terminated from employment,” Sony told CNET in a statement on Sunday. 
CNET attempted to contact Cacioppo via his LinkedIn profile but did not receive a comment. At the time of this writing, the former vice president of engineering has not publicly commented on the video or his subsequent termination from Sony. 
People v. Preds told Kotaku that its videos are posted online publicly rather than turned into police for an official investigation, because “the police department doesn’t work with ‘Cyber groups’ like us,” and that “that’s when the internet takes over.” However, People v. Preds also told Kotaku that “evidence has been turned into the authorities.” 
The video, which is still publicly available for viewing, shows Cacioppo in a PlayStation 5 shirt being accused by People v. Preds of trying to meet with a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. CNET says Cacioppo told the 15-year-old that his name was “Jeff” and that “Jeff” gave the teen an address for the two to meet and have sex. 
The San Diego Police Department has received People v. Preds’ evidence, but police have released no public information regarding this incident. It’s still unclear if this will develop into a case, but regardless, Cacioppo is no longer a Sony employee.

                    <span>Spider-Man: No Way Home premieres in theaters this month. If you’ve kept up with any marketing or merchandise, you already know that Peter Parker will rock a pair of new suits in the film. And when new Spidey costumes swing in, Insomniac is right there to put them into its game, Marvel’s Spider-Man, as quickly as possible. 
On December 10, Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is getting the &quot;Black &amp; Gold&quot; suit (yes, that’s its official name, according to Marvel) and the Iron Spider-like “Integrated Suit” that seemingly has ties to Doctor Strange. Once again, these suits are only coming to the Remastered edition, the PlayStation 5 version of the 2018 game that is only available as part of Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. You can catch some quick looks at the suits in the trailer below.

While not surprising to see, new costumes are always cool and this expands Marvel’s Spider-Man roster of movie suits. It already has Tom Holland’s suits from Spider-Man: Homecoming, Far From Home, and Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, as well as the costumes worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in their respective film series. 
Spider-Man: No Way Home hits theaters on December 17. You can watch the latest trailer here.

                    <span>The Marvel Cinematic Universe finally has a Daredevil and fans of the character will likely recognize the actor behind the mask. 
That’s because the performer is Charlie Cox, who portrayed the hero across three seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil series, which is technically canon to the MCU. Marvel boss Kevin Feige finally announced the news, long-rumored to be in the works, in an interview with CinemaBlend and in it, he revealed that while Cox’s casting has been announced, where we’ll first see him remains a secret. 
“If you were to see Daredevil in upcoming things, Charlie Cox, yes, would be the actor playing Daredevil,” Feige said. “Where we see that, how we see that, when we see that, remains to be seen.” 
Fans have long speculated that Cox would be returning to the role in the MCU, with some hoping he makes a more lawyer-related appearance in Marvel and Sony’s upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter Parker is in need of a lawyer, after all, considering he’s been accused of killing Quentin Beck aka Mysterio). Perhaps that’s what Feige is alluding to – it’s also possible that the MCU hasn’t quite figured out Daredevil’s first outing, meaning Feige wouldn’t have much to say on Cox’s role in the universe just yet. 
Only time will tell, but for those who have watched Daredevil, today’s news is sure to be welcome. Daredevil is largely viewed as Netflix’s best Marvel series, in no small part due to Cox’s role as the vigilante. If you haven’t yet seen Cox as Daredevil, the entire Netflix series is worth watching. Plus, some have speculated that Kingpin, the villain throughout the Daredevil series, might be making an appearance in Marvel’s ongoing Disney+ show, Hawkeye.

                    <span>Xbox head Phil Spencer has revealed that he believes today’s Microsoft could have kept Bungie around. 
This news comes by way of Axios, which reports that Spencer understands why Bungie left Microsoft to become independent in a new interview. He also said that in today’s Xbox ecosystem, Bungie might have stayed with Microsoft. 
“Could we [keep Bungie around] today? I think we could,” Spencer told Axios when asked if Bungie’s departure was inevitable. 
Spencer said that since Bungie’s departure, Xbox has learned a lot but understands why the studio left. 
“At the time, they had big ambitions,” Spencer said. “They had sold their business for a certain amount of money. They saw what Halo turned into. And it’s like, ‘Okay, Microsoft benefited more than Bungie did from the success of Halo.’ There’s no other story that can be written there.” 
Spencer continued and said he understands the appeal of becoming independent, citing that Bungie probably felt like it had another Halo-like franchise in them. 
“If you’re saying, ‘Hey, I think I’ve got another one of those in me. I want to really take another chance,’ I can understand the allure of doing that as an independent company,” the Xbox head said.
Bungie formally split from Microsoft, with whom it had made multiple Halo games, in 2007. On October 5 of that year, Bungie announced the split and said it had become an independent company. In the division, though, Microsoft retained all rights to Halo, a franchise now developed primarily by 343 Industries.
Nearly three years later, Bungie signed onto a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, with which its popular Destiny franchise would begin. In January of 2019, the studio announced that it had ended this publishing deal early, meaning Bungie was independent once more. It seems that Bungie intends to retain its independence for now.

He also revealed that the team will give all active players and owners of Final Fantasy XIV seven days of game time for free to make up for the current queue times and congestion. This news comes after the early access release of Endwalker, which has seen players waiting hours to queue into the game. Many find themselves in the thousands in terms of their spot in queue lines, meaning there’s a large number of people that players must wait in line behind before they’re able to enter the MMO.

This news comes by way of a new blog post recently released by BioWare, as reported by GameSpot, and in it, the team reveals that it’s excited to talk about Dragon Age 4 again next year. Seeing as how The Game Awards 2021 is happening on December 9, it seems another Dragon Age 4 appearance at the annual awards show is not in the cards.

“Speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore, we want to let you all know that we’re still hard at work on building the next single-player focused experience for Dragon Age,” the blog post reads. “We’re excited for next year when we can talk more about what we’re working on.”
However, the blog post continues and says that BioWare has released two new short stories from the world of Dragon Age for fans to read in the meantime. Elsewhere in the blog post, the team thanked its fans for their continued support and discussed plans for Dragon Age Day, which includes new merch, a charity auction, and more. Check out the full blog post for more information about all of that.

Well, now there&#x27;s even more Titan Quest. The Eternal Embers expansion is out now, with Asian-inspired locations and loads of new things to hack and slash.

So as you venture through procedural levels, slashing at inky monsters, you&#x27;re also solving shape-shifting puzzles and using their movement to confuse and avoid enemies.

Now it has a demo up on Steam.

When the first few dilemmas you face in an RPG aren&#x27;t ethical or character ones, but about whether it would be more tedious to continue with this character or to play through the introduction again, you know there&#x27;s a problem. By my third restart I&#x27;d abandoned all interest in playing any character I wanted, and started trying to estimate whatever would get this over with sooner. Mechajammer is a disaster. And not only because of the bugs.

You don&#x27;t want to be cramping up your fingers trying to grip a mouse that&#x27;s too small or big, or struggling with a shape that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t designed for your dominant hand. The feel of a mouse is as important as the fit, too. You&#x27;re obviously going to be touching it a lot, so you want something with a comfortable texture and a click that feels right beneath your precious little fingers.

                    <span>The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I&#x27;ve been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.
I was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: &quot;Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.&quot; This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn&#x27;t not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.

Whether you want lightning fast keystrokes to get the edge in multiplayer gaming, a fantastic-feeling keypress for a more tactile experience, or an RGB lightshow that makes your desk look like it&#x27;s hosting a tiny rock concert, there&#x27;s are many different factors to consider when investing in a new letter-rectangle.

                    <span>Epic Games ended Chapter 2 of Fortnite over the weekend with a live in-game event which a live in-game event which involved a hole in reality, a UFO invasion, a sexy babe, and a new character played by Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson. The game&#x27;s island flipped over too, revealing a whole new map for players to explore in Chapter 3 Season 1. And I find myself being lured in by two new features I usually adore in games: sliding on your knees while shooting, and swinging around like Spider-Man.

                    <span>Since 2018, Dragon Age fans have celebrated an unofficial Dragon Age Day on December 4th, highlighting all sorts of community work and events. This year, BioWare got involved too, releasing new short stories and hosting charity streams. They also took the opportunity to remind fans that Dragon Age 4 is still on the way, confirming that it&#x27;ll be singleplayer. Don&#x27;t get your hopes up for Game Awards news though, because it sounds like we won&#x27;t hear any more about it until 2022.

                    <span>The breakout novelty simulator this year for me is Powerwash Simulator, a game about methodically moving your mouse over the surface of objects to blast away grime and rust with a murderously strong stream of water. It&#x27;s not a chaotic system like Viscera Cleanup Detail, it&#x27;s just a game where you slowly make something dirty all sparkling clean. Very chill. Now you can unwind with your pals and clean cars, toilets, fairground rides, and the rest together, thanks to the online co-op added in a recent update.

                    <span>Driving around with three snipers in the back of your jeep is overkill. But the shiny soldier boy of the Halo games has never cared less. This is the prime indulgence of Halo Infinite, the latest of the venerable sci-fi shootybangs. Sweet moments where it&#x27;s just you, an open country of undulating hillsides, and a truck full of trigger-happy marines. The developers have taken the eponymous second level of the first Halo, in which the big tin fella had to drive about helping his marooned space crew, and they&#x27;ve used it as a mood board for an entire game. Aside from a few gripes, it has worked splendidly.

                    <span>Fortnite changes faster and more dynamically than any other ongoing game. Yesterday&#x27;s epic finale to the two-year-long Chapter 2 event was again met with a radical shakeup to Fortnite&#x27;s core gameplay formula. For the start of Chapter 3 – which begins today – developer Epic Games introduces a new gameplay movement through a character who knows it better than anyone.
Spider-Man is joining the Battle Royale, and he&#x27;s bringing his web-swinging techniques with him. Players can play as the Wall Crawler in three suits: his classic red and blue comic-book look, the white Future Foundation suit, or his symbiotic black alternate. One of the new locations on the redesigned map is the Daily Bugle, a tall building that should hold a few Spider-Man easter eggs for fans.

Update 12/4/21 4:00 p.m. Central: *SPOILERS AHEAD* Fortnite&#x27;s Chapter 2 finale titled &quot;The End&quot; has come and passed. Watch the video above to see the exciting climax featuring Jonesy and The Foundation. The island as we all know it has changed forever. Well, it&#x27;s still there, just flipped or rotated. In the meantime, we&#x27;re stranded in the ocean, left to await whatever adventures lie on the newly-inverted landmass, and what role The Foundation (now double confirmed to be Dwayne Johnson!) will play moving forward.
Original Story: Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.

What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. This week, we&#x27;re tackling the franchise&#x27;s most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. 
Released for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We&#x27;ll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M&#x27;s blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M. Is it as lousy as history has led us to believe? Tune in to get our takes.

                    <span>A side effect of fatherhood is that I now see everything through my five-year-old&#x27;s eyes. Hot Wheels Unleashed is, to me, most likely a middling racing game and lesser Trackmania - but then, if I think about it, I know my kid would love it.

Hot Wheels Unleashed&#x27;s Batman expansion, featuring a handful of cars and a Batcave? To me, meaningless licensed tie-in. But my kid... My kid must never know this exists.

                    <span>It feels at times as if, over a long enough timeline, all first-person shooters trend towards becoming the same game by cribbing modes from one another. Case in point: Quake now has a horde mode. It comes as part of a new update for Quake Remastered, Bethesda&#x27;s recent spit-and-polish of the classic 3D shooter. The horde mode is made by MachineGames for 1-4 players - and the update also includes a new (or &quot;new&quot;) singleplayer add-on.

When I do decide to head down Mexico way, I&#x27;ll get a better experience for having waited. Playground Games&#x27; second patch for the game went live this week, bringing tons of fixes.

Are you big hard-drived enough to let A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build, Old Man&#x27;s Journey, Lieve Oma, A Normal Lost Phone, Secrets Of Raetikon, Cosmic Express, Fugl, Botanicula, Hacknet, The Stillness Of The Wind, The Hex - *deep breath* - Art Sqool, Hidden Folks, Cloud Gardens, Signs Of The Sojourner, Wide Ocean Big Jacket, Coffee Talk, Ynglet and many more onto your computer?

Go on, have a heart. It&#x27;ll cost $5 and 100% of the money goes to the World Land Trust.

They&#x27;re now sending out a new wave of dev kits to creators, and as part of that they&#x27;re also testing their final packaging. That includes the neat-looking case pictured above.

                    <span>Friday comes around once again, dear reader, and on this particular Friday you find us a much diminished team, since by hook, crook, or coincidence almost all the rooms in the treehouse are empty. A shock indeed. There are at least a few of us left, walking up and down the halls looking for something to do. Maybe we&#x27;ll find some games to play! Who knows? It is my eternal hope, at least.

                    <span>After playing around with cards and mechanics exclusive to Magic: The Gathering Arena, Wizards of the Coast is expanding into supporting a new digital-only format called Alchemy. This new format and everything that comes with it will launch on December 9. 
Alchemy is built on the Standard format and its yearly rotation of sets. That means when the time comes for a year&#x27;s worth of cards to drop out of Standard, they will lose legality in Alchemy as well. However, a pool of new, Arena exclusive cards will be added a few weeks after each Standard-legal set launches, meaning we&#x27;ll see new batches of digital cards every few months. Players will find these via Alchemy booster packs or by cashing in wildcards like any other card in Arena. Our first Alchemy infusion will play off of the most recen…</span>

                    <span>343 Industries is preparing for the launch of the Halo Infinite campaign next week, but it’s also kept multiplayer feedback and improvements as one of its top priorities. 
The team recently updated its multiplayer progression system to give players increased XP for the first six matches of any given day in response to calls from the community for battle pass progression to be sped up. Another popular ask from the community involves playlists, or specifically, the lack of dedicated free-for-all and SWAT playlists, amongst others such as a Slayer playlist.

Halo community manager John Junyszek released an update on Twitter today in regards to playlists, and he said some highly-requested ones are on the way.

                    <span>It&#x27;s the launch of a new MMO expansion, and you know what that means: queues. Early access to Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s Endwalker expansion kicked off today and players are reporting hours-long waits, frequent errors and more while trying to join servers.

In a forum post, Endwalker&#x27;s developers say that the game&#x27;s surge in popularity over the past year means that they&#x27;re expecting &quot;a number of logins that is yet to be seen since the launch of FFXIV,&quot; but that the global semiconductor shortage means they can&#x27;t fix the issue.

                    <span>The Last Night was announced at E3 2017 to great excitement, before that excitement was cut short the same day by the re-emergence of pro-Gamergate tweets made by creator Tim Soret in 2014.

The cinematic pixel art platformer has been quiet almost ever since, but rumours began circling this week that it would resurface at the Game Awards later this month. Not so, says Soret. &quot;It will be shown next year, not before,&quot; he told PC Gamer.

                    <span>Electronic Arts have announced plans to build a &quot;connected Battlefield universe&quot;, as part of sweeping changes to the development teams behind the military shooter. As part of the changes, Vince Zampella - co-founder of Respawn, developers of Apex Legends - is now overseeing the Battlefield franchise, and Marcus Lehto (best known for Halo) is building a new studio to create narrative experiences within the series.

                    <span>It’s been a little over 9 months since Fights In Tight Spaces first released on to Steam Early Access, and as of December 2nd, it’s kicked open the door and walked into a full release. It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. 


  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game&#x27;s multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.

                    <span>I hate to caveat a recommendation with “it gets good later” but unfortunately, the first hour of Chorus (despite the title stylisation, promotional materials do not write it out as Chorvs, cowards) is not good. Yet beyond that lacklustre start is a surprisingly tight arcade space fighter wrapped up in a wonderful bundle of pompous space magic.

It&#x27;s a game I have very fond memories of, and publisher Dotemu&#x27;s latest dev diary about the soundtrack for the upcoming remake has cast me right back to those glorious, if rather futile afternoons spent staring at my parent&#x27;s living room computer. Musician Louis Godart is recreating the original game&#x27;s music from scratch for Pharaoh: A New Era, but he&#x27;s also adding some authentic touches of his own to help do those classic tunes justice.

                    <span>If you weren’t satisfied with only three DLC packs to play with in the hybrid metroidvania roguelike Dead Cells, don’t worry. The teams over at Motion Twin and Evil Empire have got your back. The latest DLC, The Queen And The Sea, has been teased with a tiny new trailer.
The Queen And The Sea is currently planned for a release early next year. It&#x27;s described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.

                    <span>Neon Giant&#x27;s first DLC update for The Ascent is out now. They say the Cybersec Pack’s contents include “two new weapons, a new tactical, four new pieces of armor and four new animated weapon skins.” They’ve also put together a new trailer showing off these features, which you can take a look at below.


That&#x27;s pretty much it when it comes to the DLC pack, but along with it, Neon Giant have also dropped a new patch for The Ascent too. This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. 


The patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.

                    <span>As much as I enjoy your Call Of Dutys and Valorants, I just don’t think any multiplayer shooter will eclipse Gears Of War. For me, at least, it comes down to movement. The way the beefy boys slide into cover and bounce off it with ease. The side-steps and strafes in those tight-knit shotgun battles.
Recently, I wondered if there was more to my connection with Gears and its lovely movement. And then it struck me: badminton. Yes, the racquet sport I’ve played for 19 years and consider an immensely important aspect of my life. Turns out they have quite a lot in common, actually.

                    <span>The release of the new live-action Cowboy Bebop reminded me just how much I love the show, and how hard it is to find anything remotely like it. I think it’s just because of how eclectic the show is. It’s got so many different influences, ranging from Chinese action films to space operas to even the Western. It’s rare to see something with the same tone, because of how many things compose its DNA.

Mea culpa. But that glaring mistake aside, we do have a bit of a chat about Forza Horizon 5, and other good cars in games and car games in general. I balance out not talking about the Regalia by not mentioning any vehicles from the Mass Effect games.
We also have a very good Cyberpunk-themed Cavern Of Lies courtesy of Matthew, who has no updates on his Olympic feud this week, but does reaveal (during a long digression about whether or not we, personally, can drive) that it took him nine goes to pass his driving test. Nine honestly seems a bit excessive.

                    <span>If you fancy some cyberpunk ninja action to spice up your new year, Ghostrunner is getting a new DLC on January 27th. Project_Hel will let players take control of Hel, one of the game&#x27;s original bosses, as she heads out on her own quest. I hope it&#x27;s evil. I like seeing what antagonists get up to in their free time.

                    <span>Hey you, do you want a crystal replica of John Master Chief&#x27;s helmet and energy sword? No, me neither, but it&#x27;s something you can get now for some reason. To celebrate Halo Infinite&#x27;s release, as well as Halo&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Xbox have collaborated with Swarovski to make the Halo-themed crystals that fans can win via a sweepstakes or charity campaign. You can&#x27;t buy them. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d want to? They look very expensive.

                    <span>Another month, another batch of games arriving (and leaving) Xbox Game Pass. Are there interesting games coming to the subscription service this month? Yes, but this is true so often that I&#x27;ve grown blasé. I am a hedonistic king and I have grown weary of pleasure. Stardew Valley, Halo Infinite and Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator cannot rouse me out of ennui.

                    <span>&quot;Titanfall is part of our DNA,&quot; says the latest announcement from Respawn Entertainment, before going on to reveal that they&#x27;re having gene therapy. Titanfall 1, the studio&#x27;s first game, is being removed from sale today and will disappear from subscription services on March 1st, 2022. It&#x27;s the inevitable end for the wall-running mech battler, a multiplayer experiment that started cutting bits out of itself mere months after release.

Version 1.5.5 was released today, and while it adds no new content it makes &quot;some important technical changes for modders, some quality of life changes, and some bug fixes&quot; for the farming simulator.

                    <span>The folks over at Heart Machine have slid back into the fold with a game set in the same universe as their action-adventure debut Hyper Light Drifter. Except this time it’s not a top-down hack-and-slasher, but a stylish skate to save a civilisation on the brink of collapse. Solar Ash sees you flipping onto the backs of massive monsters and felling them like you’re performing athletic acupuncture. So yes, it does retain something from its predecessor, and that’s the element of cool. This is a cool game. One that excels when it lets you off the leash, only, that doesn’t happen as often as I’d have liked.

On December 15th, players will be able to jump into a fresh set of campaign missions in the looter shooter, but instead of playing as your usual Warframe, you&#x27;ll hop into the shoes of a bunch of different characters. The devs call it a &quot;cinematic expansion&quot; that&#x27;s  chock-full of story stuff answering &quot;long-standing questions&quot; about the game&#x27;s universe.

                    <span>Last year, Overwatch introduced an experimental mode that Blizzard have mostly used to test potential balance changes, and show players what the devs have been messing around with internally. They tend to be fairly minor tweaks, and there hasn&#x27;t been an experimental update in a little while. But last night we finally got a new one, and from what I&#x27;ve played it&#x27;s full of daft and fun tweaks. Prepare yourselves for flying Roadhogs and Genjis, nanoboosted Anas, and a handful of wonderfully-timed voicelines.

The co-op shooter will also introduce new guns, challenge cards and a place for you to see your alien-bashing stats. What&#x27;s more,  it&#x27;s coming to Xbox Game Pass too. I was never going to buy this game, but I&#x27;d love to try it out. Thanks for that one, Game Pass.

                    <span>One of the most impressive mods going is the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, a full retexture and visual polish of Capcom&#x27;s horror shooter, and it&#x27;s finally nearing fruition. The developers have announced plans to release version 1.0 on the 2nd of February, 2022. The care and attention to detail of this mod is stunning, looking so much nicer than both Capcom&#x27;s official makeover and the recent Resident Evil 4 VR, and I can hardly wait to play RE4 again with it.

                    <span>Halo Infinite surprise-launched its multiplayer a couple of weeks ago. People seem to like it a lot, grindy and unrewarding battle pass aside. If you, like me, are more interested in the game for its singleplayer, then have a gander below for the launch trailer put together ahead of the campaign&#x27;s December 8th release.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t much envy Bethesda. All game development seems like a bunfight with the impossible, but following in the footsteps of Skyrim is surely cursed. Starfield, the team&#x27;s sci-fi open-world game, needs to be the same and different and better than Skyrim, a game that has been consistently popular for ten years.

In the latest, teasing, behind-the-scenes Into The Starfield video, the development team discuss some of the values that remain the same between Starfield and Bethesda&#x27;s other games. It maybe starts with the cups.

                    <span>The Grand Theft Auto games are full of jokes - or, as I like to call them, &quot;jokes&quot;. I&#x27;m referring to the series&#x27; habit of replacing words in signs and company names with rude soundalikes or double entendres.

These jokes have been restored by GTA: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition&#x27;s latest patch, which corrects spelling on signage, puts the hard angles back on the Tuff Nut logo, and stops it raining indoors quite so often.

Released on PC today following Apple Arcade and Switch versions, it&#x27;s made by a team including two heavy-hitting murdergame veterans: the director of the Zero Escape series, and the writer of Danganronpa. It&#x27;s about a group of schoolchildren who find themselves in an undersea theme park and are forced by a clown to- oh for, what is it with these cheery mascots who have one jacked-up eye and a propensity for violence?

Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 arrived today, bringing with it deeper underground layers, taller mountains, and a couple of new biomes to explore. I&#x27;ve been really eager for the 1.18 update specifically so I can build a nice home in the new Lush Cave biomes. Underground houses are the best! And now I can live near pretty cave plants!

Atari are releasing Sid Meier&#x27;s classic Command series on Steam tonight, so you&#x27;ll be able to get your hands on Decision In The Desert, Crusade In Europe, and Conflict In Vietnam. They&#x27;re a vintage bunch of RTS games that make you a commander in various wars, you know, if wars were about controlling tiny little blocky tanks in a bright blue desert.

                    <span>In the last few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time looking through scopes. Red dots and ACOGs and telescopic ones. From one FPS to the other, I put my eye up to a lens and I press triggers. Sometimes I’m a sniper dropping Nazis to protect my father, sometimes I’m a soldier surrounded by 127 other players. Lately, I’m a chunky spartan with crunchy crayon armour.
All this time with the three big FPSes of the year, each packaged in their own ways, has left me wondering what’s important nowadays. Do they need campaigns, or is multiplayer-only the way to go? How about introducing one a bit later than the other?

                    <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s tactical FPS Rainbow Six Siege ushered in Year 6 Season 4 today. Named High Calibre, it introduces new defensive operator Thorn, who&#x27;s special gadget is a sticky grenade that explodes into razors when it detects an enemy. Ouch. The other big change with this season is a rework of the Outback map, which cleans up a lot of junk to improve sightlines, and help attackers strategise.

Tactical RPG Wartales gave me the opportunity to promote a wild boar to the captain of my troupe of wandering mercenaries. I did not. Instead, I fell back into stale, boring habits like “entrusting the lives of my comrades to someone with ambitions outside of ‘moar acorns plz’.” Not a moment goes by that I don’t wistfully consider what might have been.

Clarity Boost, as they call it, aims to make games look better through some client-side processing fanciness. The feature is currently only supported in a test version of the Microsoft Edge browser, planning to roll out to regular Edge soon.

                    <span>Though Halo Infinite launched in decent shape (our Ed called it &quot;the most stable FPS I&#x27;ve played all year&quot;), one bone of contention has been the slow pace to unlocking things on the battle pass. The developers, 343 Industries already boosted progression pace, but evidently that wasn&#x27;t enough, and now they&#x27;re coming round for another pass at the pass. From today, they&#x27;re planning to offer bonus XP for the first six matches you play every day.

They say the extra three months will help ensure their team keep a healthy work-life balance, while having more time to add polish and go through QA.

CDPR had previously said Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s next-gen console update would be out by then, but confirming another big patch for everyone then too is news. Not big news, but welcome news, especially considering how many new players the game has picked up since going half-price in Black Friday sales.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.
