Retro publisher Hamster just can&#x27;t get off of its Namco kick at the moment. This week&#x27;s entry to its classic-filled Arcade Archives is one of the developer&#x27;s lesser-known arcade releases. Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it&#x27;s Namco&#x27;s futuristic tank battler, Assault.
Released to the Japanese arcade scene in 1988 under the title &quot;Akeaka Assault,&quot; before trundling west under its simpler, localized title, Assault is a future-set top-down shooter that puts the player in the driving seat of an intergalactic tank, and tasks them with bringing down their planet&#x27;s colonizers in a uniquely dark narrative — and one that is surprisingly prescient to modern eyes... 
In Assault, you play a native warrior of a far-off planet, who starts out upon a one-man rebellion again…</span>

After two years in Early Access, it&#x27;s time to check back in with Grounded now that it&#x27;s been fleshed out with more bugs to battle and harvest, more impossibly large backyard sights to seek out, and a fully realized story — complete with an eventual ending — to uncover.
Having only dabbled in the early build, back when there were hardly any threads to follow, I&#x27;m surprised how far Grounded has come thanks to ongoing updates and a big final push for the 1.0 launch on PC and Xbox. Originally, the familiar yet creative-up-close shrunken world was its biggest asset — and it still is to this day. But now, the whole survival loop feels cohesive, with plenty of thoughtful touches you&#x27;d expect from a passion p…</span>

This weekend, I had the good fortune to sit down with Capcom&#x27;s upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6 for the second time in as many months. Having already spent some solid time with the flashy fighter at the VSFighting tournament just six weeks ago, FGC punching bag Chris Moyse was given the opportunity to spend a solid few hours at a brand new build — showcased at premier UK trade show EGX.
And this time was special. This time, there was 100% more Juri...

Good morning, my beauties, and welcome to this week&#x27;s edition of Whatcha Been Playing? I hope that you have a warm drink to hand this cold fall morning, and I thank you for taking time out from your weekend to check in with us. It&#x27;s getting colder out there for sure. Wish I was there to warm you up.
For now, however, it is the weekend, and I hope that yours is filled with happiness, joy, good food, good friends, and video games. And if you are working, then I hope you have a smooth shift, and are able to make the most of the time which you do have to yourself — perhaps later this evening, or tomorrow. Either way, treat yourself this weekend, whenever you are able to, and be kind to yourself, always.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a waiting game
Anyone who&#x27;s been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you&#x27;ll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we&#x27;ve been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft&#x27;s beloved classic. It&#x27;s been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.
The previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We&#x27;ve now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;ll be getting any updates any time soon.
Ubisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn&#x27;t considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IsoIUHDrPcg
Some Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.
Part of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it&#x27;s anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.

                              <span>Some fans are wondering what&#x27;s happened to it.
It&#x27;s officially October, and technically - we&#x27;re now out of the third quarter of 2022. While it might not seem like a big deal, it&#x27;s become quite a talking point for Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II fans who picked up the Switch version of the game.
Not long after the June 8th launch, Aspyr mentioned on its official website how the Sith Lord DLC for KOTOR II on Nintendo Switch would be released by Q3 2022:

                              <span>Double, double, toil and trouble.
Coming from developer MassHive Media, Potion Permit is a sweet little social sim-meets-adventure RPG. However, unlike the majority of life simulators currently dominating the eShop, Potion Permit presents no crops to cultivate and no farm animals to tend to, and instead relies on medicinal foraging to help those around the town, which may be a welcome change of pace for life sim fans who&#x27;ve had their fill of farming.
Potion Permit immediately thrusts you into the role of the village chemist. You&#x27;ve been called to Moonbury through a special request sent by the mayor, so you must accept. But upon arriving, the town&#x27;s citizens turn a cold shoulder toward you and won&#x27;t explain why. So even though you&#x27;re quickly whisked away to a private neck of the woods and instructed that it&#x27;s your sole purpose to heal the townsfolk of any number of unlikely illnesses, the game focuses on the distaste toward the capital and its chemists and requires you to prove yourself.

We did it folks! We made it through the barrage of game releases — more commonly known as &#x27;September&#x27; — and we live to write another day! Though October is looking just as packed... *gulp*
Here at Nintendo Life, we&#x27;ve played through the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 fan game made entirely in Super Mario Maker 2, gotten silly with life sims and lauded Lord of the Rings RPGs of old. It has also been an exciting week as we found out not only that Cuphead would be getting a physical release, but we got our first look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s newest &#x27;mon Wiglett — he&#x27;s quite the weird little fella!

One of the returning characters in the upcoming release Fire Emblem Engage is Marth. This character originally debuted in 1990 and has made multiple appearances since then even outside of the series. In the new mainline Fire Emblem, Marth returns as a legendary hero.
In the lead-up to the game&#x27;s Switch release earlier this year, Nintendo has been publishing more information about each of the characters. Here is a closer look at Marth, along with a description:

Earlier this week, the Switch received the Anniversary Edition of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. As amazing as it is to finally have this particular version of the game on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system, it seems some players are encountering performance issues.
A number of Skyrim Anniversary Switch users are reporting frame rate issues - including stuttering and frame rate drops. Others are supposedly experiencing crashes more regularly now, with a lot mentioning how they&#x27;ve been playing the game&#x27;s Survival Mode. Here&#x27;s a look at one of the videos blowing up on the Nintendo Switch subreddit at the moment:

September wasn&#x27;t a bad month at all with games like Splatoon 3 and Return to Monkey Island, but October is shaping up to be even better.

The Bayonetta series will also make its long-awaited return, and if that wasn&#x27;t enough Mario + Rabbids are back in a brand new adventure. Here&#x27;s what to be on the lookout for this month:

To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft na vedlejší kolej snížením ceny za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, čímž činí proces aktualizace mnohem dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, a tím ušetříte ještě více. A tady je, co můžete dostat.</span>

Národní úřad pro kybernetickou a informační bezpečnost (NÚKIB) představí svoje aktivity v oblasti ochrany utajovaných informací z hlediska problematiky TEMPEST a kompromitujícího vyzařování. V rámci přednášky budou vysvětlena rizika úniku informací formou parazitního elektromagnetického vyzařování. Součástí bude také oblast optických vláken a jejich využití například pro prostorový odposlechu hlasu. Možnosti útočníků a principy, na kterých jsou útoky založeny, posluchačům přiblíží praktické ukázky prokazující jejich funkčnost.</span>

                              <span>Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic&#x27;s aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. 
Those who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic&#x27;s image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.
You can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.

According to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company&#x27;s creations all hold important links to his personal life.
&quot;A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,&quot; he said in a press release. &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very &#x27;90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there&#x27;s a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn&#x27;t really very preppy, but that&#x27;s the fun of it.&quot;
The collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you&#x27;d like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.</span>

                              <span>The Steam Deck, Valve’s mini PC, is a wonderful gaming device with plenty of excellent titles to choose from. But as a straight-up handheld computer, the Deck isn’t too shabby for non-gaming computing needs. Whether it’s using the Deck as a dockable desktop computer, a portable coding station, or even a tool for game…

The team behind Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is giving fans a taste of the lore awaiting them in the new RPG. The writing team has shared a handful of codex entries from Dreadwolf, as part of a community update on the next Dragon Age.
In a BioWare blog post, the team behind Dreadwolf runs down the basics. As it says, stories and characters are at the core of BioWare games. Each person has their own motivations, and each entry has its own hero, molded by player decisions.
Creating a world that&#x27;s interesting to role-play in, then, is pretty important. And that&#x27;s what today&#x27;s codex entries tease out. Dreadwolf will set out for the Tevinter Imperium, an old and powerful region ruled by a host of mages.

NieR: Automata was first released in 2017, just close enough to the Switch launch date that it could have helped define the console&#x27;s larger identity. It&#x27;s definitely a &quot;Style over Horsepower&quot; game, and did little to tax the hardware of the now last-gen PS4. It&#x27;s also developed by PlatinumGames, who&#x27;ve done a lot to build their audience on Nintendo consoles in recent years. Between The Wonderful 101, the full Bayonetta franchise, and Astral Chain, the Switch is where the bulk of their character action games live now. That&#x27;s another reason why it&#x27;s felt a little weird to see NieR: Automata on every major platform but Switch for all these years, but then again, weird has always been Nier&#x27;s thing.
Now the game is finally headed to Switch on October 4, 2022, and I&#x27;…</span>

Boutique retailer Limited Run Games, not content with merely offering up physical games, toys, clothes, and soundtracks, has decided to get into the world of the printed word, with the announcement of a new book publishing arm, Limited Press Run.
The new endeavor, which is led by Limited Run writer Jared Petty and media researcher Jeremy Parish, will see Limited Press Run publish a range of books based on video games and game-adjacent topics. Hitting the ground running, the new outlet has already released its first three tomes, which focus on various aspects of retro gaming — a topic that is obviously close to Limited Run&#x27;s heart.

                              <span>To be this bad take AGES
Following up on its previous interest in the controversial and highly unstable blockchain market, Sega has announced that it is partnering with a Japanese developer to publish its first blockchain video game.
As reported by 4Gamer and VGC, the untitled release will be a new entry in Sega&#x27;s strategy series Sangokushi Taisen — a hybrid coin-op/card game franchise — based upon the legendary Romance of the Three Kingdoms folklore — is popular with Japanese arcade goers but is something of an anomaly on western soil. Sega is allowing studio Double Jump Games to license the Sangokushi Taisen IP for its new blockchain project, utilizing the company&#x27;s &quot;Oasys&quot; technology. Details are sketchy at this juncture as to what form the blockchain element will take, but characters and artwork from the series are likely to be part of the collectible process.
As you have likely read about, here and else, the blockchain and NFT market, allows for the creation of artwork, icons, items, and other tokens to be stored in an online capacity, with ownership rights to be bought, traded, and sold. While the past year has seen all manner of franchises and companies swiftly declare their love for the new tech, the market itself has proven incredibly unstable, leading to huge losses in revenue, stolen &quot;ownership&quot; of items, and artists&#x27; work stolen and &quot;resold&quot; in NFT format.
In addition, video game companies trying to implement blockchain/NFT technology into their titles have often backpedaled in the face of criticism and derision from their respective communities. For more information on how NFTs and blockchain technology is attempting to become part of the mainstream gaming market, you can check out our previous feature by Jonathan Holmes.

                              <span>More information on the labor complaint against Nintendo emerges
Earlier this year, a Nintendo worker filed a labor complaint against the company. Now, we&#x27;re getting more details on the allegation that Nintendo&#x27;s dismissal of the worker was over a labor inquiry.
The labor complaint was filed earlier this year against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter. It alleges the companies violated the legally protected right to discuss unionization without fear of retaliation.
In an interview with Axios, the worker is coming forward as Mackenzie Clifton. The tester alleges they were fired in February, over a question about unions during a Q&amp;A portion of a meeting.
In this company meeting for Nintendo testers, during a Q&amp;A with Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, Clifton says they ask…</span>

Ohhhhh. These are the same developers who made Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time.
Now, this all makes sense.

Valkyrie Elysium (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed])
Developer: Soleil
Publisher: Square Enix
Released: September 29, 2022 (PS5 &amp; PS4) / November 11, 2022 (PC)
MSRP: $59.99

Let’s not beat around the bush on this one: Valkyrie Elysium is not a good game. Outside of one specific enemy design, there isn’t a single thing I like about it. Not the characters, not the graphics, not the story, not the level design, not the world-building, and no, not even the combat. From top to bottom, this is about as mediocre of an action RPG title that you’re going to find on the market, one that would arguably be passable if it were rus…</span>

Today was supposed to see the release of the physical edition of Sega&#x27;s witchy classic Bayonetta on Nintendo Switch — But European fans of the lollipop-chomping gunslinger have come unstuck at the last minute, with Nintendo announcing, on launch day, that it is delaying the release in UK and Europe.
&quot;We are now aiming to release the physical edition of Bayonetta in the first half of October, exclusively on My Nintendo Store,&quot; reads a very succinct message from The Big N. &quot;Please stay tuned for more info. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.&quot;
While hardly the end of the world, the launch day delay for Bayonetta in Europe and the UK will no doubt further the ire of Nintendo fans in those territories, who are already smarting from another distribution problem earlier in the year, when fans were informed that the collector&#x27;s edition of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was delayed due to &quot;unforeseen logistical challenges&quot;. To date, said collector&#x27;s edition is still unavailable to order in both Europe and the UK.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited sequel, Bayonetta 3, will launch on Nintendo Switch October 28.

Publisher Krafton has released a brand new trailer for its incoming sci-fi horror title The Callisto Protocol, teasing up further gooey &#x27;n&#x27; gory action ahead of the title&#x27;s release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox this December.
As a quick refresher, The Callisto Protocol is developed by Striking Distance Studios and hopes to capture the unsettling terror and visceral horror of nerve-jangling franchises such as Alien and Dead Space. Set within the walls of a desolated, intergalactic prison complex — Black Iron — The Callisto Protocol follows the unenviable escapades of a party of investigators who find themselves lost within the aftermath of some terrible event, rendering the prison, and perhaps the entire planet itself, a viral, mutant-filled, living nightmare. What caused this whole abomination? It&#x27;s your job to find out.
Oh, and if you live to tell the tale, that would be useful too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8yf_mXDPAKw
As protagonist Jacob Lee, players will explore Black Iron and its surrounding, fending out a grotesque army of twisted guards and prisoners with an arsenal of melee and ranged weaponry. As Jacob picks his way through the cells, corridors, and execution chambers of space jail, he will slowly piece together the clues pointing to what exactly happened on Callisto moon and, with any luck, find a way to stop it. The Callisto Protocol is looking suitably creepy, incredibly gory, and worth a spot on the radar of any survival horror fan.
The Callisto Protocol launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms December 2.

&#x27;Tis Friday, and, like clockwork, Epic Games Store has revealed the identities of the next free titles that it will be rolling out to store users over the next week — And it looks like there&#x27;s something of a Very Metal theme to next week&#x27;s fare, with the arrival of pixel actioners Rising Hell and Slain: Back from Hell (no relation.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;B-2q0rB6f-g
First released in 2019 and developed by Indonesian developer Tahoe Games, Rising Hell is a Gothic rogue-lite dungeon crawler that places a heavy emphasis on platform traversal and verticality. Players embark upon a seemingly insurmountable challenge to literally climb out of Hell, starting at the very pit of oblivion and working their upwards, battling horribly unholy demons and monsters en route.

                              <span>Through the Dragon&#x27;s Eye
Activision Blizzard has announced a release date for Dragonflight, the newest expansion to its iconic fantasy MMO World of Warcraft — the new content will be made available to all players on November 28.
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, like the many, many WoW expansions that have come before it, will welcome players to a brand new locale — The Dragon Isles. This long forgotten continent will comprise or four new areas — The Waking Shores, The Azure Span, The Ohn&#x27;ahran Plains, and the opulent kingdom of Thaldraszus — each packed out with quests to be undertaken, dungeons to be raided, and loot to be gathered, providing hours upon hours of new adventure for the community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;UANuDDQTNKY
Alongside the new locations, Dragonflight will also play host to a metamorphic new class, the Dracthyr Evoker. These characters can switch between their human and dragon forms, and will represent the first-ever &quot;hybrid class&quot; in WoW&#x27;s long and storied history. In addition, as the expansion&#x27;s title suggests, Dragonflight will feature a brand new, fully overhauled flight system, allowing players to take to the air with the greatest of ease in more deliberately controlled, skill-based aviation. What&#x27;s that in the sky?
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will launch globally on Monday, November 28, for specific times for your chosen territory, check out the details over on the official Dragonflight website. Good luck, scalies!

                              <span>The Ed Sheeran x Pokémon love affair continues
I love a good pop star/video game crossover, and thankfully they&#x27;re pretty common these days. As part of the upcoming release of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, Pokémon teamed up with global pop sensation Ed Sheeran, whose new song will be featured in the game. It&#x27;s called &quot;Celestial,&quot; and the music video is out right now, featuring familiar faces like Squirtle, Pikachu, Machamp, and Snorlax, just to name a few. Fans are guessing that it might be used as an end credits song, or possibly as an upbeat opening to the game.
Believe it or not, this isn&#x27;t the first time that Ed Sheeran has collaborated with the Pokémon brand. Last year, he put on a virtual concert in Pokémon GO that players could watch in-game. The concert included performances of six of his most beloved songs, and players could find special Pokémon as part of the event, including a Squirtle wearing sunglasses. Rapper Post Malone also put on a virtual concert for Pokémon fans last year to celebrate the series&#x27; 25th anniversary.
https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1575504573909069827
Personally I&#x27;d love to see more songs written specifically for games. Movies license well-known artists for their projects all the time — that&#x27;s how we got bangers like &quot;Sunflower&quot; by Post Malone and Swae Lee for Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse or &quot;All the Stars&quot; by Kendrick Lamar and SZA for Black Panther.
That&#x27;s not to say this hasn&#x27;t been done already for games, though — the example that comes to mind is Florence + the Machine&#x27;s cover of &quot;Stand by Me,&quot; which served as the theme song for Final Fantasy XV. Then there&#x27;s &quot;Popstars&quot; by K/DA, which was the theme for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, which was a virtual girl group formed by members of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE as well as some western artists. Basically, I just want more songs like those, and this new Ed Sheeran number is a good start.

Let&#x27;s start with a question: Why are you here? Of all the many games launching in the latter third of 2022, this is perhaps the most dependably, dryly predictable in form and function: a Let&#x27;s Sing game featuring songs by Abba. Sure, you might be curious about the playlist or the various modes in this particular entry of the long-running karaoke series, but as video games go, this particular quantity is about as &#x27;known&#x27; as they come.
Perhaps you&#x27;re here for the same reason we said &#x27;yes&#x27; to review code: sometimes you just need something reliable and restorative. Times are tumultuous and the unexpected offer of a night in belting out some bangers with friends and family in a no-stakes, low-stress environment sounds like just what the doctor ordered. For hardened gamers, there&#x27;s no worrying about avoiding spoilers online or impaling yourself on a difficulty spike with Let&#x27;s Sing Abba; it&#x27;s as wonderfully low-maintenance and uplifting as you expect it to be.

What is it with Animal Crossing: New Horizons and surprise nudity? Whether it&#x27;s the accurate portrayal of classical statues (junk and all!) or the weird glitch that made villagers lose their clothes, we&#x27;re starting to wonder if this is some plot of Tom Nook&#x27;s to generate interest in some kind of nudist vacation spot.
Anyway, there&#x27;s more nudity to come, and this time it&#x27;s in the form of everyone&#x27;s favourite purple cat villager, Bob:

Most video games are either two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Most... but not all. Today, we&#x27;re celebrating the games that dip their toes into the underappreciated and underexplored fourth dimension: Time.
Unfortunately for us 3D peasants, we are forced to experience time in a linear fashion, going from Tuesday to Wednesday like utter plebs, unable to revisit the salad days of the previous Monday and make sure that we didn&#x27;t make that terrible joke at the dining table, or spill spaghetti sauce all over our nice new jumper. But hey! At least we play video games, a medium in which nothing is set in stone and everything is save-scummable — and the Time Loop sub-genre exists as a narrative framing device. Hooray!

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition has sneaked its way onto the Switch eShop, giving players the option to purchase a full version or, if you already own Skyrim, a less expensive DLC upgrade alternative. But what in the Todd Howard are we getting for our money this time around?

A GameCube development kit has been found in an early build of the Wii&#x27;s menu. Shared by Forest of Illusion and provided to them by an anonymous community member, it&#x27;s possible that this was discovered on the very first Wii menu — the one used during E3 2006.
Our friends over at Time Extension reached out to Forest of Illusion for more details on this discovery, which is apparently the TDEV dev kit. And, according to the Nintendo preservation site, there&#x27;s a chance this was the model that showcased a number of games at E3 2006, the year the Wii came out, including Zelda: Twilight Princess — which launched on both the GameCube and the Wii.

                              <span>Another day in the life.
At this point, it seems almost certain that Square Enix is using an AI to randomly generate new titles in its “Underlined Serif Title” RPG series. Triangle Strategy already felt like it was pushing the limits, but we’ve now been graced with the delightful Various Daylife. After an initial exclusive launch on the Apple Arcade subscription service, this new, low-key RPG from Team Asano has made the jump to Switch for the low (but still kinda high…) price of thirty bucks. Offering up a bite-sized take on the kind of gameplay that catapulted titles like Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler to success, Various Daylife proves itself to be a decently fun experience, but it also demonstrates that the phrase “less is more” applies to playtime, too.
The story of Various Daylife begins with your character arriving in the city of Erebia on a new continent. As part of an ongoing colonization effort, Erebia is full of opportunity and promise, and there is still quite a bit of untamed land and mysteries beyond the city&#x27;s borders. To help in the effort of expanding the city, your character joins an expedition team and begins fulfilling various odd jobs between excursions, making friends and allies along the way. The narrative, then, is not defined by a larger plotline as such; rather, it’s the mosaic of smaller intersecting stories that comprises the bulk of the Various Daylife experience.

Fans of the Bullet Witch Bayonetta will have to wait for physical copies of the game&#x27;s Switch release for just a bit longer in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has announced that the My Nintendo Store exclusive has been pushed back to &quot;the first half of October&quot;.
The physical launch was originally due out today, and Nintendo UK (and its numerous European branches including Nintendo DE, España, and France) have confirmed that the boxed version has been pushed back.

Yesterday, the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope story trailer dropped and gave us a bunch more footage of all the characters we are going to be able to see when the game releases for Switch on October 20th. On top of the classic team, the Rabbid Lumas and the newly-introduced Bowser, the trailer looks like it&#x27;s teasing the presence of another Mario all-star (if you&#x27;ll pardon the pun) and she may not be quite as friendly as we&#x27;ve seen her in the past.
If you couldn&#x27;t guess from our stellar hint above (or, indeed, from the title), many seem to think that Rosalina may have a part to play in the latest tactics game, but not as a hero.

San Diego Comic Con had a pretty monstrous-sized Koopa built all out of LEGO bricks to deal with back in July. We were stunned by this 14-foot tall LEGO Bowser back when it was first shown off, and now LEGO has decided to share some behind-the-scenes footage of just how dear Bowser was put together.
Using the 2,807-piece Bowser set as a reference, this ginormous structure took 3,290 hours to build — that&#x27;s over 137 days. And if you thought over 2,800 bricks was a lot, try 663,900. It&#x27;s a LEGO fan&#x27;s dream.

There are a multitude of things that get left out of video games during development and are either hidden away in the finished code or wiped off the face of the earth before we can get our eager Nintendo-obsessed eyes on them. One extremely small detail removed from Super Mario World has recently been brought to our attention by @MarioBrothBlog, and, we don&#x27;t want to appear over-dramatic here, but we are heartbroken.
Deep within the game&#x27;s development files, a tiny green creature can be found, going by the name of either &quot;One-Character-kun&quot; or &quot;Mr. One Character&quot; in reference to his diminutive size being the equivalent of a single character of text.

While the company itself has a piracy history, today it&#x27;s one of the most protective copyright holders in the industry. With a sweeping court injunction, it hoped to take Daftsex.com and several related services offline. However, the court slammed the brakes on the request, at least for now.

                              <span>Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life&#x27;s biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren&#x27;t your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they&#x27;re all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station&#x27;s head clerk, you&#x27;ll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It&#x27;s certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.

There aren’t many details to go on just yet, but the game is in the early stages of development and will hold closed playtests on PC in Western Europe. If you’re of an inquiring mind, and like hanging out with mates in shooter lobbies, then all you can do for the moment is register your interest.

Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It&#x27;s not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google&#x27;s own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.

Imagine Nidhogg, cross it with Webbed, give it solid single player options, and throw in one of the sickest game soundtracks I&#x27;ve ever heard. I&#x27;d hoped Spiderheck would merely be as fun as it looks. It instead consumed me. Neverjam have united my love for Webbed with my love for chaos, and it&#x27;s more glorious than I dared to hope.

                              <span>Out now in early access, Slime Rancher 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Monomi Park’s charming farming sim. Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.
As a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn&#x27;t arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I&#x27;ve been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it&#x27;s put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.

                              <span>December’s a month known for its white-haired, bearded men in weird outfits and hats, so it seems a fitting time of year for Slitherine Games to launch their remake of 4X strategy classic Master Of Magic. Slitherine are referring to their take on Master Of Magic as a re-imagining rather than a remake or reboot, saying they’ve tried to be “faithful to the original in spirit and mood”. You’ll be able to Gandalf it up from December 13th.

                              <span>Out Of Hands is a fairly &quot;does what it says on the tin&quot; title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can&#x27;t say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill &quot;a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I&#x27;m pretty cut up about that&quot; story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?
But in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn&#x27;t find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin&#x27; plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.

                              <span>At this year&#x27;s Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio&#x27;s Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re able to fuse together any monsters you &#x27;catch&#x27;, but moreso because it&#x27;s a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.
I like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It&#x27;s looking mighty promising.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year&#x27;s Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn&#x27;t quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It&#x27;s the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other &#x27;deadly games&#x27; you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. 
For Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she&#x27;s teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you&#x27;ll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each &#x27;episode&#x27;. It&#x27;s a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I&#x27;ve been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. &quot;He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,&quot; creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. &quot;He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.&quot;

                              <span>Fedora již nějakou dobu zkoumá možnost akcelerovat knihovnu GnuTLS přes jaderný KTLS. Jednak jde využít HW akcelerace šifrování, ale i bez ní je KTLS rychlejší, protože umožní použití více vláken a méně přepínání kontextu. Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee ve středu schválil GnuTLS s KTLS pro Fedoru 38.</span>

The DioField Chronicle is an odd one among the cavalcade of tactics we’ve seen this year. It’s real-time, rather than turn-based; it’s about tight, compact skirmishes rather than drawn-out battles. DioField mixes wyvern and rifles, swords and sorcery, and even some airships for good measure.
Throughout the 20-ish hours it took me to finish The DioField Chronicle, there are some pretty cool concepts and ideas on display, though they’re not always framed the best. There’s a solid story, but some odd choices in direction. DioField is an interesting strategy game to play, even when it’s not at its best.

                              <span>Finally, some good news
It feels like these days, we hear of a game&#x27;s launch getting delayed at least once a week, but the developers behind the upcoming biopunk survival horror game Scorn have flipped the script. Instead of pushing back their release date, Ebb Software has announced that Scorn will be coming out on October 14 now, a week ahead of its previously planned October 21 date. They haven&#x27;t given a reason why the game got moved up, but I certainly don&#x27;t hear anyone complaining about it.
The game is inspired by the works of Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who is best known for his depictions of humans merged with machines. There&#x27;s definitely plenty of creepy uncanniness going on there, which makes it the perfect title to come out right before Halloween. According to IGN, who got to play the first hour of the game, it has a big focus on puzzles, with the most apt comparison being The Witness when it comes to gameplay. I love that Scorn leans into more of a heady, intellectual spookiness that has the player exploring the labyrinthian corridors with little to no direction at all.

As the game&#x27;s Steam page describes:
&quot;Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open — the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.&quot;
We haven&#x27;t seen a game fill the grotesque horror niche in quite a while, so here&#x27;s hoping that it lives up to the hype. I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but Scorn usually isn&#x27;t my kind of game, yet I feel really compelled to try it.

                              <span>A local village for local people
Anybody fancying a little bit of a slow burn scare this weekend would do to take a look at Cloak &amp; Dagger Games&#x27; latest release, The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, now available on PC via Steam and GOG.com.
Seeped in folk horror vibes and sporting an aesthetic reminiscent of the golden age of the Commodore Amiga, The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow is the tale of author and antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who is traveling the length and breadth of the countryside to explore the many barrows of Victorian England.
https://youtu.be/x-1C_9RQJb8
While her travels so far have brought about many interesting sights and characters, Bateman&#x27;s arrival in the little-known village of Bewlay sees her research expedition take a particularly dark turn — with our intrepid hero becoming mired in a world of unanswered questions, ancient cultures, and living nightmares, as she delves deeper into the village and its highly unnerving community.
Choosing atmosphere, mood, and impending dread over the genre&#x27;s well-worn trope of tired jump scares, The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow blends mystery, exploration, and a sense of ancient malevolence to weave its tale, beckoning the player in with its intriguing locale, creepy cast of characters, and plucky, daring protagonist. It looks to be a real sleeper hit of the year, and well worth checking out for those who like their ghostly goings-on a little on the psychological side.
The Excavation of Hob&#x27;s Barrow is available now on PC via Steam and GOG.com.

Vampire Survivors is gearing up for its v1.0 launch. Developer poncle has announced that v1.0 will go live on October 20, 2022.
This will mark the completion of the main content for Vampire Survivors, according to the developer update. And it sounds like there are some unforeseen changes in store. Since the official roadmap ended with 0.11.3, everything added in v1.0 is a surprise. Poncle says it should &quot;hopefully offer a little something for everyone&quot;.
Official language support is getting updated, with a bevy of languages getting official support. Custom patches will still work, and poncle will be keeping the names of fan localization creators in the credits as thanks.

Microids, in so many words, told us that they were on a mission to deliver a billion Smurfs video games, and they weren&#x27;t just whistlin&#x27; dixie. Following on from the release of platform adventure The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf in 2021, the French publisher has now dropped a release date for the next title in its horrifying oeuvre, Smurfs Kart.
Headed to Nintendo Switch on November 15, Smurfs Kart will see the garden-dwelling dopes take to the racetrack in a variety of ramshackle vehicles, all seemingly made from the shit they just had lying around, (although Smurfette seems to have built herself a pretty snazzy roadster, at least when compared to most of the abominations on display).

                              <span>Switch, PS4, and Xbox One editions announced
You might&#x27;ve already dipped in, but if not — or if you&#x27;re fine doubling up — then it&#x27;s good to know that a physical edition of Cuphead is on the way from iam8bit and Studio MDHR.
As shared on Twitter, the Cuphead physical edition is &quot;coming soon&quot; to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. The DLC, The Delicious Last Course, will be included on the disc, which isn&#x27;t always the case but would&#x27;ve been egregious in this situation — it&#x27;s so crucial.
As for regional releases, &quot;Cuphead will come to retail with ESRB, PEGI, USK, and ACB versions,&quot; according to iam8bit.
https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/1575470762235875329
The distributor is taking &quot;keep me in the loop&quot; email sign-ups today — but no word on release timing yet. With how widespread the Cuphead brand has become, I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of opportunities to snag a physical copy at a reasonable price.
An eventual spiffy collector&#x27;s edition would be great to see as well — there&#x27;s so much art to consider — but an all-inclusive standard physical release is a good step.
It&#x27;s truly one of my favorite games of the last decade, and for many of us, even folks who have moved mostly to digital, it&#x27;s worth adding to the physical collection.

                              <span>Ahead of the physical release of Bayonetta 1 on Switch
The two Bayonetta Switch games just got a version 1.1.0 patch (1, 2), mostly to shore things up language-wise (Korean, and traditional/simplified Chinese) ahead of the release of Bayonetta 3 in October — as well as the debut of the first Bayonetta on Switch in physical form.
Due out on September 30 (mine already shipped!), a $30 physical edition of the original game will be released, said to be &quot;limited in number&quot; by Nintendo directly. Interestingly enough, the Masquerade Edition of Bayonetta 3 will have three sleeves, which will allow you to store the first entry in it.
It&#x27;s a flood of Bayonetta-related news! It&#x27;s weird to think that this series debuted in 2009 (!), and it&#x27;s still alive and kicking today. It just speaks to the overall quality of it, as some of Platinum&#x27;s best work to date: and two of the best technical action games of all time. Hopefully Bayonetta 3 will complete the trifecta.
Bayonetta Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
Bayonetta 2 Switch Version 1.1.0 ［September 29, 2022］
General
Added support for Korean, Chinese (simplified), and Chinese (traditional) as in-game display and subtitle languages.
*Voice support languages ​​are Japanese and English only.
*The latest update data is required to play online elements.
*Local communication is not compatible with Ver. 1.0.0. Please match the version of the update data with the person you play with.

The three big Nintendo Switch eShop releases this week offer something for everyone — but at least two of them will be met with some form of consternation.
Overwatch 2 is technically launching on Switch in the coming week (Thursday-to-Thursday), as it drops on October 4 on all platforms (with cross-progression). Then there&#x27;s EA Sports FIFA 23 Nintendo Switch Legacy Edition, which doesn&#x27;t cater to a whole lot of people; given that it&#x27;s a Switch version of a yearly sports entry.
But then there&#x27;s Railgrade, a $20 sci-fi train management sim, which is definitely going to cater to a lot of folks. The rest of the week is pretty packed, so enjoy navigating the 100s of digital games that launch every month on Switch.

                              <span>Refunds will roll out for games and hardware
Google is shutting down its cloud-based game streaming service Stadia. After a few years of operation, the service is shutting down and refunds are rolling out.
In a new blog post, Google VP and Stadia general manager Phil Harrison says the technology &quot;hasn&#x27;t gained the traction with users&quot; it expected. So the company has decided to wind down its Stadia services.
Google will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store. All game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store will also be refunded.
Those who want to can keep playing their Stadia games through January 18, 2023. So if you&#x27;ve got a save file you want to clear, you&#x27;d better get on that. Google expects to have the &quot;majority&quot; of refunds completed…</span>

                              <span>Good Fortune
Fun news for retro block-busting fans this week, as publisher Forever Entertainment has announced a return for the classic puzzle series, Magical Drop. Magical Drop VI, developed by studios Highball Games and Storm Trident, is scheduled to launch later this winter on Nintendo Switch.
Magical Drop, for those less inclined, is a cute &#x27;n&#x27; colorful arcade puzzler that first launch in 1995, at the height of the &quot;tile-puzzler&quot; craze. Playing from one of a number of cute avatars, all based upon the Tarot, players must cherry-pick colored orbs from a rapidly descending playfield before firing them back in an effort to match the rainbow-infused patterns together. The goal of Magical Drop is to cause a chain reaction, and thus the player is encouraged to set up several moves ahead of time, that can all be triggered with one final, scalpel-precise move, (hence the series&#x27; Japanese title &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;).

Developed by Data East and published by SNK, several Magical Drop games were released to arcade and home platform markets throughout the mid-&#x27;90s. The series&#x27; most recent release, Magical Drop V, launched on Steam in 2012 and was an enormous disappointment, riddled with bugs and issues that often rendered it incompletable. The game was eventually pulled from sale. This new release will no doubt be looking to capture the charm and character of classic entries while delivering engaging gameplay within a variety of single and multiplayer modes.
The visual style depicted here looks a bit &quot;Flash game,&quot; but I remain hopeful, as Magical Drop happens to be my personal favorite of all the tile-puzzle franchises. My character of choice? Empress... But then... you knew that already, right? Shock-freakin&#x27;-horror.
Magical Drop VI is currently in development for Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>A new thread to pull
Another PlayStation exclusive is making its way to the PC soon. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is getting a PC port on October 27.
Sumo Digital&#x27;s thread-bound platformer released for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in 2020, as part of the PS5 launch lineup. Now, it&#x27;s getting the PC treatment, with some new features in tow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MAaEqyE_Hfg
The new port of Sackboy will allow for 4K resolution with a target of 120 FPS, if you&#x27;ve got the hardware for it. The platformer will also support a range of display ratios, including wider options like ultrawide, or 21:9.
Sackboy: A Big Adventure will also have NVIDIA DLSS2, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, for those with compatible graphics cards. Variable refresh rate support will also help with all that platforming.
While that&#x27;s all for higher-end hardware, the PlayStation Blog also highlights lower-end options. It seems like owners with relatively older hardware might still be able to make this game run, albeit at lower settings.
The next big adventure
Sackboy is getting some customization options too. A Big Adventure will fully support the DualSense controller, so you can get those haptics and dynamic trigger effects, same as PlayStation 5.
Mouse and keyboard will also be supported, in both gameplay and the user interface. Achievements are included too, as are cloud saves on both Steam and Epic Games Store.
This seems like a good grab for folks who dig co-op in particular, but maybe don&#x27;t have the newest hardware. As per our review, Sackboy: A Big Adventure seems like a pretty enjoyable co-op platformer to blast through with a friend or family member.
Sackboy also marks another PlayStation-exclusive game headed to PC. And considering how well these have been going, like with Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man and God of War, I&#x27;d hope to see more continue making their way over.

                              <span>If you somehow haven&#x27;t played Skyrim yet, it&#x27;s out...again
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition is out now on Switch, thanks to a sudden eShop drop from Bethesda. Wait, the Switch already had Skyrim?! About that!
As a reminder, nearly five years ago, Skyrim came out on Switch (and subsequently, every device ever). &quot;I knew it!&quot; you&#x27;re all saying right now. The one that&#x27;s coming out today on the platform is actually the &quot;Skyrim Anniversary Edition,&quot; which has the following features:
&quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim celebrates 10 years of adventuring in stunning detail. The Anniversary Edition includes a decade worth of content: the critically acclaimed core game and add-ons of Skyrim Special Edition, plus pre-existing and new content from Creation Club including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, spells, and more.&quot;

What does Skyrim Anniversary Edition on Switch actually have?
Those features, to be exact, include:
&quot;The core game, pre-existing and new Creation Club content, plus all three official add-ons: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.&quot;

Nintendo of Europe points out that in addition to buying this new &quot;complete bundle&quot; for $69.99, you can also upgrade your existing version for $19.99. Of course, it&#x27;s almost parody at this point: putting some convoluted version of Skyrim out on some other platform randomly without warning.
(Cue the old man voice) Back in my day, we played Skyrim with no mods or DLC! And it was...sort of OK! But eventually small-to-large DLC packs came out for it, some mods rose in popularity (and were integrated into the game by proxy), and then a GOTY edition came, and the rest is history. We&#x27;re stuck in an endless time loop of Skyrim, with Skyrim Anniversary Edition being the latest version.

                              <span>History repeats itself
For the longest time, Sega&#x27;s Shenmue series was renowned for being an incomplete saga — an epic tale that had no ending. It seems, ironically, that history is set to repeat itself, as it has been suggested that anime adaptation Shenmue: The Animation has been canceled, and will not receive a second season.
The first inkling that the show would not be returning came from the Cartoon Network Schedules Twitter, which noted that the anime had been removed from the Adult Swim VOD archive. This would then be followed by a mournful message from Cartoon Network Senior VP of Animation, Jason DeMarco, who confirmed on the social media site that Ryo Hazuki would not be returning for further adventures.
&quot;Sorry guys. This happened,&quot; wrote DeMarco. &quot;And yes, it’s looking like no [season 2] of Shenmue, even though sadly — it did well enough that we were gearing up for [season 2]. Maybe one day…&quot;

It&#x27;s disappointing to hear that the show was canned despite being, apparently, something of a success. Unfortunately, as TV/movie fans are fast becoming aware, streaming media has become a Wild West Show, with shows, characters, films, and IPs being shot down, binned, or canceled within the blink of an eye, or, more accurately, the swipe of some suit&#x27;s pen. We see you, Batgirl.
If you want to watch Shenmue: The Animation, then the entire first season is available on anime network Crunchyroll. It&#x27;s a strange irony to see the Shenmue anime adaptation canceled and rendered incomplete in the same way the video game series was once rendered incomplete. Still, an ending — in a fashion — did eventually rear its head, (even if it took several decades). So keep the engine turning on that forklift truck. Stranger things have happened.
Shenmue: The Animation is available to stream on Crunchyroll.

                              <span>Massively multiplayer games rapidly calcified around a specific set of design ideas (eg. World Of Warcraft) and so many other attempts to jam a load of players onto a single server quickly disappeared (eg. most games by Improbable or Amazon). 

Foxhole is one of the few to do it successfully: a single, massive World War 2 battlefield in which players don&#x27;t just fight at the frontlines, but form supply routes, build defenses, and otherwise take the reigns of the logistics of war. After five years in early access, Foxhole released version 1.0 today.

Although reaching 1.0 means leaving early access, it&#x27;s also not the end of Vampire Survivors development. Work on porting the game to a new engine continues with the aim to &quot;release it by the end of the year.&quot;

If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, or even &quot;possibly, why?&quot;, then you might find Retro Gadgets handy when it launches on PC towards the end of the year. It’s a gadget creation station that lets you “invent, build, solder, code and customise” your own electronics. That’s according to Bologna-based devs Evil Licorice, who count amongst them Kingdom co-creator Marco Bancale. Check out the trailer below, and try not to burn yourself with any soldering irons.

I&#x27;d literally just woken up and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, only to emotionally destabilise my morning with an eight-minute-long video in which one of, if not the greatest tennis player of all time poured out his heart. Even his great rival Rafael Nadal couldn&#x27;t hold back his tears, which said it all, really.

                              <span>Sci-fi miniatures sim Moonbreaker launches into early access on PC today, but Brandon Sanderson, the renowned fantasy writer behind the game&#x27;s story, says he&#x27;s working on at least ten years&#x27; worth of story ideas. Brandon Sanderson is known for his prolific ability to churn out books, but he’s also a fan of games and has been working closely with Moonbreaker’s devs Unknown Worlds to map out where the game’s story will go.

Having spent much of my early thirties skulking around the Barbican, I really enjoyed this variety of Brutalist experiences. And the monstermurder. The monstermurder&#x27;s fun, too. Here, come admire how pretty the hub level is.

The trailer for Sackboy: A Big Adventure has since been taken down, but by then the boy was out of the sack and its existence was noted on Twitter. There’s been no other official confirmation yet of the game’s release date for PC, or what storefronts it’ll be available from.

The second I began Shovel Knight Dig, it felt like returning home. As someone who hadn’t played most of Shovel Knight’s post-launch DLC, the last time I touched this series was nearly a decade ago. Gaining control of the titular character immediately felt familiar, and my old Shovel Knight habits returned to greet this new take on the series, led by developer Nitrome this time. The moment-to-moment experience plays excellently, in part because it’s more Shovel Knight with some well-designed gameplay twists. However, the game’s venture into roguelite territory feels i…</span>

                              <span>Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. 
More specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won&#x27;t be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds &quot;for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,&quot; according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won&#x27;t be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you &quot;will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.&quot; 
If you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says &quot;most hardware purchases...made directly from Google&quot; will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia&#x27;s January 18 shutdown date. 
The Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. 
Stadia shutting down isn&#x27;t the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming&#x27;s continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia.

                              <span>Publisher Kepler Interactive and developer Ebb Software have revealed that Scorn&#x27;s release date has changed, moving up one week earlier in October. The game will now release on October 14 instead of the previously announced October 21. 
As for why, the team doesn&#x27;t say. However, a new teaser trailer released today is titled, &quot;You&#x27;ve waited long enough,&quot; so perhaps the studio simply wants to get this game into players&#x27; hands sooner. Check it out for yourself below: 


Here are some screenshots from the game:

                              <span>EA and Koei Tecmo&#x27;s co-op beastie-botherer Wild Hearts will mix katanas, massive animals, and wacky crafted weapons when it launches in February. The Dynasty Warriors studio revealed their collaboration as part of the EA Originals label today, and it’s certainly channelling some of that there Monster Hunter energy. Watch the first trailer below and tell me you don’t want a handheld helicopter.

                              <span>What appears to be an announcer pack voiced by Mark Hamill and leaked from Warner Bros licensed brawler MultiVersus indicates that The Joker might be arriving in a future update. Twitter user Laisul shared a recording of what they claimed are lines from an unreleased Joker pack, and they do sound like Hamill’s classic rendition of the Batman villain. Why so serious? Well, announcer packs replace the default MultiVersus announcer with the voice of one of the game’s fighters, so Joker’s addition to the roster seems legit.

In hindsight, it&#x27;s a bit of an interesting year for Time Capsuling purposes, as we&#x27;re now getting to the point where games from this era are getting their own remakes and remasters, or fancier, super duper director&#x27;s cut special editions. We&#x27;ve included the original 2011 release of one of these games in this month&#x27;s Time Capsule, but there&#x27;s another notable exception we&#x27;ve decided to save for further down the line. I mean, seriously, would you really recommend vanilla Skyrim from 2011 over 2016&#x27;s Special Edition?

                              <span>There&#x27;s a definition of &quot;pure&quot; that&#x27;s proscriptive; a dogmatic adherence to surface details and strict rituals. I&#x27;m genuinely not thinking of any specific game, but many &#x27;retro&#x27; inspired games fall into this way of thinking, and many more fans cut a good one down because of it.
Itorah, however, feels pure in the sense of capturing the essence, the heart of a good retro platformer, not just going through the motions to technically qualify for an arbitrary category. Aeons ago, it would have ported comfortably to your GameBoys and gramophones, and probably look just as pretty and feel just as good in motion, judging by the talented art direction on show here.

                              <span>It’s usually nice to see older games get updates, particularly when we’re not expecting it. Think of it as a good jump scare. Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.

Although, he did qualify that it would have to be in keeping with the Overwatch franchise.

                              <span>MMO action RPG Genshin Impact’s 3.1 update, King Deshret and the Three Magi, goes live in the game today, bringing three fresh characters and desert-themed areas to explore. The update borrows heavily from ancient Egypt, with animal-headed gods adorning the walls of pyramids and dusty tombs. Pop your head inside the cavernous trailer below and take a look for yourself.

                              <span>Yakuza spin-offs Judgment and Lost Judgment have arrived on Steam! This means you can mete out justice with your fists and do some important detective work... and do some drone racing... and participate in some robot wars. It&#x27;s Yakuza with a murder-mystery twist that&#x27;s well worth your while even if you&#x27;re not actually that big on Kiryu or Ichiban&#x27;s antics. I&#x27;d even go so far as to say it might be the perfect side entrance into the Yakuza series as a whole.

                              <img src="https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review-1.jpg/BROK/thumbnail/1600x900/format/jpg/quality/80/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review-1.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>It&#x27;s tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob&#x27;s Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.
This looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob&#x27;s Barrows&#x27; arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn&#x27;t care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It&#x27;s a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob&#x27;s Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.
As well as the voice acting, Hob&#x27;s Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn&#x27;t a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina&#x27;s eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.

While already being very impressed by the performance of AMD EPYC Milan-X since those 3D V-Cache server CPUs launched earlier this year, here is a fresh round of Linux benchmarks looking at the EPYC 7763 vs. 7773X performance when running on a development snapshot of Ubuntu 22.10 paired with the Linux 6.0 development kernel and other newer software packages for a very up-to-date look at the performance potential on the server side.</span>

                              <span>Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. 
It was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it&#x27;s slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.
Kotaku&#x27;s Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game&#x27;s development. 
Here&#x27;s what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: 
The last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer&#x27;s cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I&#x27;m not surprised it&#x27;s been delayed again.

                              <span>Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo have revealed Wild Hearts, a new Monster Hunter-like game coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year. 
More specifically, this EA Originals title will be released on February 17, 2023. This news comes by way of the game&#x27;s reveal trailer released today. In it, we see a lot of monster hunting action. The game seems to take place in a mythological land filled with large and dangerous beasts. You&#x27;ll need to craft better gear to take on tougher monsters, eventually taming the otherwise wild area. 
Check out the reveal trailer below: 


As you can see, Wild Hearts looks great, especially if you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s a fan of Capcom&#x27;s long-running Monster Hunter series.

&quot;I&#x27;m Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!&quot;
Between the moment Guybrush uttered this iconic line in Return to Monkey Island and our reintroduction to familiar characters like used ship salesman Stan S. Stanman and Cobb, with his &quot;Ask me about Loom&quot; badge, I was already shrouded in a haze of nostalgia. And you would be eating all these up, too, if you&#x27;re a Monkey Island fan. The thing about Monkey Island enthusiasts is that we can talk your ears off about what makes the series so unique. It&#x27;s the earnest naivety of its pirate hero Guybrush Threepwood and the serie…</span>

This news comes from a new Overwatch 2 blog post, as reported by Destructoid. In it, Blizzard says a consistent piece of feedback it has received is that new players feel overwhelmed by Overwatch&#x27;s hero pool and various modes. As such, the team has implemented a new First Time User Experience, or FTUE, designed for Overwatch 2 players who have never played Overwatch. 
The new FTUE addresses that feedback directly. In phase one, players will need to unlock the game&#x27;s modes and chat functions – this happens &quot;rapidly,&quot; Blizzard writes in the blog post. Then, in phase two, players will unlock the original Overwatch heroes by playing &quot;approximately 100 matches,&quot; a…</span>

                              <span>There are Pokémon designs like Charizard that make me go, &quot;ooo yes, very nice&quot; and there are others like Voltorb that make me go, &quot;oh, why do you exist?&quot; There&#x27;s also a rare third class of Pokémon I call &quot;weird lil things&quot; when I see them and Wiglett, a new Pokémon joining the Pokédex in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, is that class&#x27; newest member. 
Today, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a 3 and a half minute video highlighting Wiglett, its similarities to Diglett, and how it&#x27;s just different enough that it is an entirely new species, rather than a regional variant. As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii&#x27;s video below: 


I&#x27;m most excited to see Wiglett&#x27;s evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I&#x27;ll see that in another trainer&#x27;s party because I&#x27;m not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. 
For more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon. After that, read our preview of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet to find out everything you need to know about the Paldea region. 
Is Wiglett going to be in your party? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below!</span>

Projekt je oproti oběma konkurenčním pochopitelně ve skluzu (Intel naskočil do této sféry se zpožděním v řádu let), nicméně ke cti mu přičtěme, že zde Intel slušně investuje do vývoje a XeSS bude nakonec dostupný pod otevřenou licencí.

                              <span>The next early access update for grim roguelike Darkest Dungeon 2 revamps its progression system and brings in some temporary hired muscle in the form of bounty hunters. The Altar Of Hope update is already live in the game’s experimental branch and is coming to the main game when devs Red Hook are satisfied with its stability. You can catch a glimpse of the bounty hunter in the teaser below.

                              <span>I had hoped to bring you a proper review of Moonscars today, the new 2D Soulslike from indie studio Black Mermaid. But alas, both time and its ferociously difficult combat have got the better of me, so you&#x27;ll have to settle for some impressions instead. This isn’t simply a case of drinking the &#x27;git gud&#x27; kool-aid either. While I&#x27;ll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I&#x27;ve been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars&#x27; reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it&#x27;s become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I&#x27;ve chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon.

You can now pop in whatever music you want to listen to, not just metal. What genre did devs The Outsiders choose to show off this new feature? Lucifer’s very own favourite, jazz, of course. Brace yourself for some syncopated shenanigans before you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>There’s nothing inherently wrong with the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT&#x27;s concept – faster clock speeds than the RX 6600 XT, to better compete with Nvidia’s RTX cards? Yeah why not – but surely its timing is questionable. Any GPU launching several months into 2022 would only ever do so under the looming shadows of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series and the AMD Radeon RX 7000 series, the latter being officially revealed in just a few days’ time. Not to mention Intel Arc Alchemist, delayed as it has been.


Still. AMD’s next-gen, RDNA 3-based GPUs are an unknown quantity, and the RTX 40 series will at first focus on high-end models like the RTX 4090. Even if its RDNA 2 architecture is on the way out, could the RX 6650 XT not find room in the pack as one of the best graphics cards for 1080p and 1440p?

In both of those western-themed platformers, you were hunting for gem-like treasures to take back to the surface so you could get bigger and better equipment to begin the dig cycle anew. Now imagine that surface is constantly under threat from waves of alien attacks and that&#x27;s pretty much Dome Keeper in a nutshell, a moreish, meditative mining game that sees you balance digging for resources and hunting for all-important relics while defending your eponymous dome from being smashed to smithereens.

The character will be floating down the River Thames, and HoYoVerse are staging an opportunity to get up close at Tower Bridge. Oh, and they’ve chosen the date of the extremely busy London Marathon as the start of Paimon’s journey along the Thames. What a time to be alive.

The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. 
Alongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!

There’s a few notable tweaks to MultiVersus in the patch, including a major change to XP between levels 3 and 15. You’ll need twice as much now. Developers Player First Games have tried to rein in infinite combos, too. You can get a look at Rick by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>Serial Cleaners is Draw Distance&#x27;s follow-up to the singular Serial Cleaner, a stylish 2D stealth action game where you clean up crime scenes without getting caught. Where the original offers a more traditional top-down view where you&#x27;re avoiding cops&#x27; attention by dodging cones of vision, Serial Cleaners sprinkles different characters and abilities into the mix, alongside a visual revamp that ups more than just the aesthetics. And it works! Making the act of evidence disposal an action-packed affair that makes it a great game to play in bursts.

The story wasn&#x27;t complete and the garden was rather basic, but one encounter with the wolf spider proved that this was far more than a pile of mulch.

Zde MGLRU prodělal další ladění kvality kódu a nyní to opravdu vypadá, že začlenění je na spadnutí. Projekt se totiž přesouvá do větve  mm-stable.</span>

Obecně lze říci, že procesory jsou oproti předchozí generaci dražší (nejvyšší model přes 20 tisíc Kč a i desky a DDR5 Paměti budou dražší), hladovější (TDP nejvyššího modelu vzrostlo z 105 na 170 W), ale výrazně výkonnější (+13% IPC, maximální frekvence sahá k 5,7 až 5,85 GHz, přibyla např. též instrukční sada AVX-512 a podpora DDR5 a PCI Express 5.0).</span>

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen some really fun examples out there of games working with other brands or other games,&quot; Spector says. &quot;I&#x27;m a big anime nerd myself.

Tinykin smartly blends platforming and puzzle-solving with the minion management of Nintendo&#x27;s Pikmin series. Players control a flea-sized astronaut who travels from his home planet to Earth to trace humanity’s true origins. The explorer’s journey takes him to an ordinary home occupied by sentient insects who worship a mysterious deity. To return home, the astronaut must assemble a rocket by gathering ordinary household objects with the help of small, adorable aliens called Tinykin. As a fan of “little person in a big world” experie…</span>

                              <span>Overwatch 2 introduces a bevy of new characters, maps, and modes when it launches early next week. However, the most significant change arriving alongside the sequel&#x27;s new free-to-play format is a Battle Pass. The pass&#x27; free track allows players to unlock a new support character named Kiriko, while its premium track – which costs $10 or 1,000 Overwatch Coins – offers unique cyberpunk-themed cosmetics like weapon charms, souvenirs, and legendary skins. Players who complete the 80-tier premium Battle Pass receive Cyber Demon Genji, the first of Overwatch&#x27;s new class of customizable cosmetics called Mythic Skins. 
We recently interviewed Overwatch 2&#x27;s leadership group to learn about their philosophy while developing the Battle Pass and Mythic Skins&#x27; role in the sequel&#x27;s revamped monetization …</span>

                              <span>At long last, HBO has released the first trailer for The Last of Us. Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. 
The teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity&#x27;s collapse a la the game&#x27;s prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. 


The Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.
To help prepare fans for what&#x27;s to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1. You can read editor Blake Hester&#x27;s impressions of that title here.</span>

                              <span>In March, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) announced that E3 would return next year as an in-person show following the cancellation of the 2022 edition. We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.
E3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. 
The ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. 
June 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   
As previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a &quot;world class event to serve the global gaming industry.&quot; The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill: The Short Message has been rated by South Korea&#x27;s Game Rating committee, and it&#x27;s possible this is a new unannounced Silent Hill game. 
This news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reported that the rating committee rated Silent Hill: The Short Message today. However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it&#x27;s unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. 
The publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. 
While waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama&#x27;s new game, Slitterhead.

                              <span>Marvel has stepped up its gaming output these past few years. Following the success of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man in 2018 by Insomniac Games, the team later announced Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, due out sometime next year. Insomniac is also working on a Wolverine game. Elsewhere, Motive Studio just announced last week that it&#x27;s working on a single-player Iron Man game and before that, Marvel pulled back the curtains on Amy Hennig&#x27;s new game that features Black Panther and Captain America. There&#x27;s also Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, which is still getting content today, and last year&#x27;s excellent Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
All of this is to say that Marvel has been pumping out a steady stream of games with more to come. However, despite that, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the company to create a co…</span>

                              <span>Night School Studio has delayed Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. 
Originally set to release this year, Oxenfree II will now debut sometime in 2023. The team didn&#x27;t mention a specific window, however, so as for when in 2023, that remains unknown. It could be just a month or two into the new year or six months into the new year – only time will tell. As for why, Night School Studio says it needs more time to make this sequel &quot;truly special&quot; and to add more localizations. 
Here&#x27;s the studio&#x27;s full statement on the delay:

                              <span>With its invasion of Ukraine, Russia ignited a regional conflict with global repercussions. Thousands of lives have been lost and many more ruined. In response, many U.S. entertainment industry companies took a stand by ceasing their Russian operations. Through the IIPA, many of the same companies now want to urge Russia to keep online piracy in check.

                              <span>A while back, I was wondering where all the Steam Deck accessories were. Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.
I therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.

                              <span>A great many new Cyberpunk 2077 mods are adding bits and pieces from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the new ultraviolent spin-off anime series. Various mods let V dress up as characters from Edgerunners and wield their weapons, as well as adding music, adverts, and more to the game world. Players old and new have flocked to the dystopian RPG since Edgerunners debuted on Netflix earlier this month, and I imagine more than a few might want to cosplay as their Best Girl (a controversial topic which I dare not broach).

There hasn’t been an in-person E3 since 2019, and just one digital event bearing the E3 name has taken place since then. That’s a pretty big deal for a show that ran relatively unhindered for almost a quarter of a century. New organisers ReedPop are the people behind PAX, EGX, New York Comic-Con, and Star Wars Celebration, to name a few. I should mention too, of course, that they&#x27;re this site’s parent organisation.

                              <span>&quot;House of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; are two completely different TV series.

While we can&#x27;t say which series is better, the download numbers show that torrenting pirates clearly favor the Game of Thrones prequel.

                              <span>TNTVillage was once the most popular torrent site in Italy. It had an ethics policy that prevented newly released content from being shared but that stood for nothing when the owner&#x27;s home was raided in 2018. Despite the site closing down in 2019, legal action continued for another three years as copyright holders attempted to take down a solitary remaining hyperlink.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Everyone&#x27;s talking about Trombone Champ. Not since Untitled Goose Game have I heard this much excited chat about a game from pals who don&#x27;t usually talk about games. This is because: 1) it&#x27;s a fun silly idea; 2) it&#x27;s very funny to miss a trombone note and squeal out a farty toot in the middle of Also Sprach Zarathustra. As I play Trombone Champ myself, I come to really appreciate that. It&#x27;s a rare rhythm game where playing badly doesn&#x27;t frustrate or berate me, because the worst-case scenario is making fart noises, and fart noises are funny.

Journalist Matthew Keys tweeted that a source has told him that the teenager’s detainment was related to the Rockstar hack and another involving Uber. Keys claimed that the suspect is connected to hacking group Lapsus$, which organises through Telegram channels.

If you signed up to the alpha anytime in the past few months since the game was announced then you might want to keep an eye on your emails for an invite.

                              <span>The remake of classic stealth ‘em up Splinter Cell will be rewritten and updated for a “modern-day audience”, according to a job posting for the project. Ubisoft Toronto are looking for a scriptwriter for the new Splinter Cell, which they say uses the original as a “foundation” and aims at a “new audience of Splinter Cell fans”. I hate to break it to you Ubisoft, but I’m not certain that the kids dig Tom Clancy military espionage hijinks.

                              <span>There’s a new fighter announcement incoming from Warner Bros. licensed brawler MultiVersus today, with three already revealed characters yet to release in season one. My money’s on Rick And Morty’s Rick Sanchez, but Stripe from Gremlins and the DC Universe’s Black Adam are still set to arrive too. You’ll have to wait until 6pm BST/7pm CEST/10am PST to find out who the next fighter is, according to a tweet from the MultiVersus team.

Kindly, they&#x27;re going to check in across the day, texting us all with updates on what they&#x27;re seeing, doing, and (I imagine) eating. And Ollie might join in from home with cat photos.

                              <span>After a copyright blunder led to a major boost for the horror genre, George A. Romero&#x27;s Night of the Living Dead became a public domain classic. But in a terrifying new twist, YouTubers are now completely surrounded by a horde of Content ID notices claiming ownership and monetization rights. Screams for help are being ignored as Universal Music-owned Ingrooves gorges on the spoils.

                              <span>Nearly a quarter of all U.S. households believe that piracy is justified because music and movies should be available to anyone for free. Research by Parks Associates reveals that this percentage has increased significantly in recent years. According to some experts and insiders, this can in part be explained by the fragmented streaming landscape.

In what is one of the largest video game leaks of all time, over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel were leaked on GTAForums and quickly spread via fans on YouTube and social media. 
Additionally, we chat about this week&#x27;s news of a collaboration between Marvel Games and EA Motive to develop a single-player Iron Man game. During The Playlist, we dive into our time playing Splatoon 3, TemTem, and Metal: Hellsinger.

                              <span>Illumination’s Super Mario Bros. film will get its first teaser trailer next month. It also has a new premiere date for the movie following its delay in April. 
The animated film, starring Chris Pratt as the titular plumber, will hit theaters on April 7, 2023. The biggest question regarding the film has been what Pratt’s Mario performance will sound like, and we may finally get to hear it in just a few weeks. The movie’s first teaser trailer premieres on October 6 at 4 p.m. ET during the New York Comic Con.

The Super Mario Bros. cast includes Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong. The film was delayed to ensure quality, though Nintendo was reportedly pleased last year with how the film was shaping up at that point. Pratt recently described his performance as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world,” and it apparently won&#x27;t have an Italian accent.</span>

                              <span>The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan&#x27;s empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team&#x27;s play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.
League Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it&#x27;s clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet&#x27;s original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.

That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.
It’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.

                              <span>Nvidia stuck to the high-end goods for their GeForce RTX 40 series announcement, revealing their next graphics card generation with only the premier RTX 4090 and two flavours of RTX 4080. All three are coming soon with varying degrees of price bumps over the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080, though Nvidia reckon the performance and feature improvements of the 40 series’ Ada Lovelace architecture will make them worthy investments. Especially with the aid of DLSS 3, a new and significantly upgraded version of Nvidia’s DLSS upscaler that will only work with RTX 40 series GPUs at launch.

CD Projekt have revealed in a tweet that the game has seen one million players every day this week so far, across all platforms. They say this figure includes players new to Night City, as well as those returning. I’ve never played it, so don’t look at me.

Oh, and they&#x27;re cheeping little tinging cheeps! And they hop back if I step towards them! And they flutter into the skies if I charge! And form a big flock if I chase long enough! Ah. Yeah, I think I see how our character earned a place in superhell.

FromSoftware confirmed that PvP multiplayer for the Steam version of the game had gone offline in a tweet, and said they’d provide an update once details were available to share. When I published this post, no explanation was forthcoming about what the cause of the downtime might be.

                              <span>Have you ever played a game and thought, &quot;Are we actually the bad guys here?&quot; Usually, the whole &quot;we&#x27;re fighting on the wrong side of history&quot; line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you&#x27;ve achieved so far. I don&#x27;t say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you&#x27;re looking for. 
Around 8-10 hours into the game, there&#x27;s an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they&#x27;re, err, pro democracy. Of the cast&#x27;s central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he&#x27;s repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, &quot;Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.&quot; It&#x27;s an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck.

                              <span>The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. 
EA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team&#x27;s biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors&#x27; likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t indicated if we&#x27;ll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent&#x27;s signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent&#x27;s chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).
Regardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond&#x27;s home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club&#x27;s manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.
You can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.


FIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.</span>

When Gun Interactive revealed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre last year, I was underwhelmed by its short teaser but excited about its potential. It’s one of my favorite horror movie franchises, partly because of how much it still scares me – every good haunted house has a Leatherface at the end that chases you out to the exit, right? – but also because of its backdrop: Texas. Horror, be it movies or games, typically draws attention to dreary atmospheres, spooky ambiance, perhaps some bad weather, and nighttime. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre bucked that trend in the 1970s.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover &#x27;charms&#x27;. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.

Except, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it&#x27;s something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.

                              <span>The 1.26 patch for Spelunky 2 has finally brought crossplay for all platforms to the randomised platforming sequel, along with online multiplayer for its Adventure and Arena modes. Creator Derek Yu said that more updates are planned for Spelunky 2, but the next step is to get feedback on multiplayer to improve the experience now its basic features are there. Don’t expect any more additions to single-player though, as the focus there is bug fixes.

The company said they became aware of the attack early yesterday, after an “unauthorized third party” managed to access the credentials of a vendor to 2K’s help desk platform. The hacker then fired off a message to some accounts that contained a malicious link.

Think of the Machinist as the Aldi equivalent to Marvel’s Tony Stark, Iron Man. He’s still packed to the circuit boards with machine guns, lasers and drones, even if he is an own-brand alternative to the Armoured Avenger.

                              <span>The best way I can explain the difference between Devil Daggers and its surprise sequel is comparison to another pair of goth-o-ramas: Devil Daggers is Dark Souls to Hyper Demon&#x27;s Bloodborne. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!
When I first saw Hyper Demon&#x27;s trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here&#x27;s the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That&#x27;s how it feels to play, too.

Nope - the game wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.

                              <span>The Sonic the Hedgehog brand&#x27;s expansion throughout multimedia has given fans plenty to enjoy in recent years. Whether you&#x27;re talking about the two well-received films, the fun Sonic Boom animated series, or the long-running and beloved comic series, people who enjoy the Sonic the Hedgehog video games have had plenty of other avenues to expand their fandom. The next project to land on that list is Sonic Prime, the upcoming Netflix series that gives us all-new adventures with Sonic and his friends/enemies.
Today, Netflix and Sega released a teaser trailer giving us a taste of the action. It doesn&#x27;t show much, but if the 40 seconds of action are any indication, it&#x27;s bringing plenty of style and fun (as well as several classic characters). You can check out the trailer in the header above.
Sonic Prime is set to release exclusively on Netflix this winter. For more on what else Sonic is getting up to this winter, check out our exclusive coverage hub of Sonic Frontiers here. For our thoughts on the latest Sonic video game release, Sonic Origins, head here.</span>

Blake Hester and I have been touring the show floor, checking out games, and taking plenty of pictures. We shared our first batch of TGS photos yesterday (check them out here) and have even more images to help make you feel as close to the event without being here as possible.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of this week&#x27;s announcement of Ken, Dhalsim, Blanka, and E.Honda in Street Fighter 6, Capcom has posted the opening video of World Tour mode from the highly anticipated sixth mainline entry in its legendary fighting franchise. Through the video, the publisher reveals the full fighter roster at launch, featuring a good mix of fresh faces and familiar foes.
The launch lineup of fighters includes 18 characters to choose from. You can see the full list below.
Blanka
Cammy
Chun-Li
Dee Jay
Dhalsim
E. Honda
Guile
Jamie
JP
Juri
Ken
Kimberly
Lily
Luke
Manon
Marisa
Ryu
Zangief


Many of these fighters made their first appearances in Street Fighter (Ken and Ryu) or Street Fighter II (Blanka, Cammy, Chun-Li, Dee Jay, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Zangief). However, some fresher faces include Juri (debuted in Street Fighter IV) and Luke (debuted in Street Fighter V), and six all-new characters: Jamie, JP, Kimberly, Lily, Manon, and Marisa.
Check out the opening movie above and start plotting who will be your main when Street Fighter 6 launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC next year.

NBA 2K23, the latest in Visual Concepts’ long-running, annualized basketball series, introduces multiple new features and revamped game mechanics while taking us on a stroll down memory lane. Though the 2K franchise has garnered a reputation for focusing more on microtransactions than actual gameplay innovation, this year’s game mode additions and foundational improvements mostly overshadow the notorious pay-to-win schemes. The result is a package that feels more novel than other titles in the …</span>

Although Capcom just pulled the curtain back on the next batch of fighters to join the roster, my demo included the first playable sessions for the last trio of reveals: Guile, Juri, and newcomer Kimberly. Since Kimberly was the wildcard of that bunch, I opted to spend most of my hands-on time discovering what she brings to the table. After only a few rounds, I had a tough time wanting to switch to anyone else.
If you haven’t been keeping up, Kimberly is a ninja pupil of Guy who adores the ‘80s and graffiti. She incorporates the latter interest into her acrobatic offense, such as throwing exploding spray cans like they’re shurikens. That’s silly and fantastic.

The Pokémon franchise has been more prolific than usual as of late, with multiple releases over the past year and another big entry coming soon. However, those without a Switch or looking for a suitable monster-battling alternative should focus on Temtem, which has emerged from years of early-access development. While borrowing heavily from the formula of Nintendo’s massive franchise, its world is fun to explore, and collecting and learning all about the titular Temtems is satisfying. Although the core adventure is a smi…</span>

                              <span>I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. 
My expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…</span>

                              <span>Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won&#x27;t tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. 
Over the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we&#x27;re getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. 
The reality is much more depressing.
Whether it&#x27;s E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.
All that said, there&#x27;s some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you&#x27;ve never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. 
While we&#x27;d love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. 
Well, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!</span>

                              <span>Capcom has revealed that it will hold a Resident Evil-focused showcase in October, presumably to discuss both Resident Evil Village&#x27;s upcoming DLC, The Winters&#x27; Expansion, which comes out next month, and Resident Evil 4 Remake. And speaking of Resident Evil 4 Remake, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed during Tokyo Game Show that the remake will also be coming to PlayStation 4, as reported by GameSpot. 
When Resident Evil 4 Remake was revealed during a PlayStation State of Play held back in June, Capcom said it was coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with no mention of old-gen consoles like the PS4 and Xbox One. Now the company has confirmed that the game will be available on PS4 when it launches on March 24, 2023. There&#x27;s no word if Resident Evil 4 Remake will come to Xb…</span>

                              <span>Konami has revealed Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster of the first two classic Suikoden JRPGs, and the two will be released as a single package sometime next year on consoles and PC. 
More specifically, these two remasters will be packaged into the same collection and this remastered duo is due out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) in 2023. The first Suikoden was released in 1995, and its sequel, Suikoden II, was released in 1998. Check out what the remastered versions of these classic games look like in the announcement trailer below: 


As you can see, these remasters are looking excellent, especially in the way that the original look and feel of the sprite imagery remains intact. Here&#x27;s hoping they feel as great to play as they did back in the day. 
Here are some highlights of this remastered collection from the game&#x27;s Steam page:

During today&#x27;s Call of Duty: Next livestream, Activision revealed a ton of new information surrounding the next phase of Call of Duty, which kicks off this fall. It begins on October 28 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, the next mainline entry in the franchise, but perhaps culminates on November 16, when Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 lanches free for everyone. Today brought us a look at what to expect when those experiences arrive later this year, as well as a glimpse at a mobile version of Warzone coming next year.

All of this Street Fighter 6 news came during Tokyo Games Show, which officially began today, and if you’re a fan of Capcom’s long-running fighting game series, strap in because there’s a lot.


Let’s start with the fighters. 
Joining the Street Fighter 6 roster of fighters is Ken Masters, the former US National Fighting Champion and ex-VP of the Masters Foundation, Blanka, a kindhearted defender of nature and adventure tour guide, Dhalsim, a monk and yoga master, and E. Honda, a global sumo wrestler phenomenon.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming survival horror game with an extremely unique art style announced last month. Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. 
That&#x27;s when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that&#x27;s all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: 


&quot;[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game&#x27;s four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.&quot;
Here are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: 
Seek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.
Explore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.
Flight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.
Immerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.
Control your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.


Saturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27.

                              <span>Kiriko is the newest support character arriving with the launch of Overwatch 2 PvP on October 4. She wields kunai, teleports through walls to allies, burst heals teammates with talismans, and can make nearby allies briefly invulnerable with her Protection Suzu move. Oh, and her ultimate summons a fox spirit who rushes ahead and buffs friendlies that follow behind. 
Kiriko will be free for all Overwatch 1 players, or you can earn her by reaching Tier 55 on the battle pass&#x27; free track. Of course, you will instantly unlock the character alongside newcomers Sojourn and Junker Queen by purchasing the premium battle pass. Not only is Kiriko the first support capable of keeping up with fast characters like Tracer and Genji, but the development team informed us her healing output should be similar to Moira and Mercy. 


Kiriko&#x27;s Abilities In Overwatch 2
Protection Suzu – Upon impact, allies in the area become briefly invulnerable and are cleansed of most negative effects.
Kunai – Thrown projectile that deals increased critical damage.
Swift Step – Teleport directly to an ally, even through walls.
Healing Ofuda – Channel a burst of healing talismans that can seek targeted allies.

                              <span>At Gamescom 2022, we spoke to James Worrall and Adam Olsson, Creative Director and Art Director on Dead Island 2, to learn more about the long-awaited sequel, how the team is balancing comedy and horror, and how exactly they plan to make zombies monstrous again with their procedural FLESH system. Set within the once-bustling city of Los Angeles, the game pulls inspiration from 80s action movies like Die Hard and George A. Romero&#x27;s Dawn Of The Dead and features iconic locations overrun with hordes of zombies you can eviscerate piece by piece.
