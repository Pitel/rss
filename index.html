At Nintendo&#x27;s February Direct Showcase, Sega and Atlus announced they would be bringing the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection to the Switch eShop on 1st June for $80 USD.
The game&#x27;s price point has raised some discussion online and in a recent interview with IGN, Sega of America justified the cost with the amount of content and gameplay players will get out of the three-in-one package. Here&#x27;s the full exchange:

As you&#x27;ve likely heard by now, Niantic will be making some adjustments to Pokémon GO Remote Raid Passes in an update next month - increasing the prices and also limiting the amount of these raids players can participate in per day.
Admittedly, this decision hasn&#x27;t gone down well with the game&#x27;s community. On social media and various websites, many trainers appear to be frustrated by this news - with some labelling it the &quot;worst decision&quot; possible and accusing Niantic of restricting the experience.

Niantic&#x27;s hugely successful mobile title Pokémon GO has announced there are some changes coming to the game&#x27;s Remote Raid Passes early next month.
On 6th April 2023, trainers can expect price increases to Remote Raid Passes, new limits to the number of times you can participate in a Remote Raid per day (a maximum of five times per day), and various other Remote Raid adjustments. Niantic explained how it &quot;never intended&quot; Remote Raid Passes to dominate the experience:

There has barely been a moment&#x27;s rest since the 7-Star Decidueye event hit Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, and now 7-Star Samurott is already upon us.

Here are when the Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Samurott events start
March 31 - April 2, 2023
April  7 - April 9, 2023
Samurott will only appear during these two weekends.

                              <span>Indie studio Majorariatto have released small, experimental games every March since 2017 - barring the cursed year of 2020 - and now they’re back with another thought-provoking adventure called Pineapple On Pizza, this time asking the profound question: can video games convey such a complex flavour? It’s out now, it’s free, and it’s only about ten minutes long.

                              <span>Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn&#x27;t even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

                              <span>Man, do I love the feeling of jamming out a guitar riff in games. Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

                              <span>A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

                              <span>Fans of Octopath Traveler have likely had their eye on Live A Live for some time now. Last year, it came to the Nintendo Switch as an exclusive remake of the 1994 RPG. Bu that exclusivity period has been brought to a surprising end as Square Enix have announced Live A Live is hitting PC and PlayStation consoles on April 27th. A demo is available now for PS owners and later today for those on Steam, if you want a preview of the first three stories from the time and genre-hopping adventure.

                              <span>E3 2023 has been canceled, IGN reports. The news comes after major publishers pulled out of the event in recent weeks.
IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA. Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show &quot;simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry.&quot;
The official E3 Twitter account has now publicly confirmed the cancellation in a brief statement posted below. 
However, IGN received a press release stating that ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on “future E3 events”. Whether th…</span>

                              <span>It’s Wrestlemania week, and one would think that the last sport to get into the spirit would be golf. However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.
On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.</span>

                              <span>We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn&#x27;t exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.</span>

The latest Japanese charts are in from Famitsu (via Gematsu) and this week sees two new titles thrown into the mix — though the familiar classics continue to put up big numbers.
Resident Evil 4 on the PS5 and PS4 take the top two spots this time around, selling 89,662 and 85,371 copies respectively, finally knocking Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land Deluxe off the top spot (now sitting in fourth place). Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key also made a strong debut on the Switch, selling 31,140 copies and just about getting on the podium in third.

Speed Crew is a delightful-looking online and local co-op game which takes the party from the kitchen to the pit stop. And, amidst a flurry of Overcooked-inspired games, Ukrainian developer Wild Fields has created something that stands out in the garage.
The game is launching on Switch on 8th June ahead of other platforms and throws you and up to three other grease monkeys right into the thick of it. You get to build and prepare a range of racing cars inspired by motorsports vehicles of the past, with multiple levels based on classic races from the 1970s to today.

Limited Run Games has a physical (and &#x27;Deluxe&#x27;) edition in the works already, of course, but this Europe-specific version is the result of a publishing partnership between Atari and Numskull in the territory and features some bespoke goodies you won&#x27;t find elsewhere, namely a couple of cute mini papercraft arcade cabinets.

The pair came up with Wildfrost after the two interacted with each other on Twitter, and then started developing Wildfrost during the pandemic in March 2020.

So what exactly does turning ten mean for this gorgeous shoot-em-up platformer? Well, a tenth-anniversary remastered edition is on its way and it&#x27;s bringing with it a boatload of new content.

First announced for Switch in March 2021, news of parcel-shipping immersive sim The Last Worker has been fascinating. Over the last two years, there’s been plenty of time for interesting little info trinkets to be packed and despatched from the Wired Productions warehouse. There was the time the game competed at the Venice Film Festival, the time director Jörg Tittel pitched development across cinematic and interactive mediums in Jerry Bruckheimer’s offices, and the relatively more grounded time that an all-star Hollywood voice cast was announced. Finally, we can look beyond the hype and hold the game in our hands.
The Last Worker sees you taking on the role of Kurt, an employee and full-time resident at the fulfilment warehouse of futuristic retailed and Amazon-alike Jüngle. Your job is to fly around on a little hover-cart, using a kind of handheld traction beam gun to take boxes from shelves and ship them through huge suction chutes. The odd thing about the scenario is that all your colleagues are robots. The job has been automated and the workforce downsized to just one: you. You are – and you’ll have seen where this is going – the last worker.

This game is set in the &quot;cozy post-apocalypse&quot; (a neat juxtaposition if we&#x27;ve ever seen one) and will see you heading online to race your friends across a series of downhill races on (you guessed it) trays! The new trailer (above) gives a pretty good idea of what these courses will have in store including some strange dinosaur/camel hybrids, a cactus slalom and a whole lotta sand.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie is out in less than a week, and with promos and adverts in full swing, there are still a few things we don&#x27;t actually know about the movie. of course,
One of those is that the voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, is reportedly getting a few cameo roles in the upcoming film. But none of those have been revealed yet. However, Spanish film and entertainment website eCartelera has reportedly got the scoop on who Martinet will be playing in the movie (thanks, Nintenderos).

Last year, it was announced that the original Bayonetta would be getting a physical release having been exclusive to the eShop on Switch since the port arrived back in 2018. Physical Switch game collectors rejoiced and all was well.
However, following delays, and having released without incident in other territories, the My Nintendo Store exclusive appeared on the UK and European stores briefly in October but quickly sold out. Nintendo promised a restock, and copies are now available to purchase once more. Rejoicing may now recommence.

Content Update 4 is coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley on 5th April — just in time for that long Easter weekend for some of us, then.
While we don&#x27;t have all of the specifics for the April Update, which was teased back in January as part of Gameloft&#x27;s roadmap for 2023, we do know that The Lion King&#x27;s Simba will be a big part of it. Gameloft has continued to update the game, fixing bugs and tweaking things, this is the first big content update since February&#x27;s Festival of Friendship update.

Mario Kart Tour has revealed that Yoshi&#x27;s Island — the brand new course that was added to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in Wave 4 of the Booster Course Pass — is coming to mobile racing game. But something else has caught people&#x27;s eye.
In the image of the new track, right behind the pipe, you can barely make out a racer in a kart. Zoom in, however, and you get a slightly better, if blurry, look at who that might be. And lo and behold, it&#x27;s Poochy driving a kart.

After several reports and confirmations of companies backing out of the show, the Entertainment Software Association (or ESA) has confirmed that E3 2023 is officially canceled.
The news first broke via a report from IGN, where two sources confirmed that the organization has announced E3&#x27;s cancellation through an email sent out to members today. The email says that while E3 is a &quot;beloved event and brand,&quot; the 2023 version &quot;did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry.&quot;
In an official press release, the ESA and show organizer ReedPop confirmed the cancellation of both the physical and digital portions of E3. Both were scheduled for June.

                              <span>Swing for the fences
Rusted Moss will finally swing onto PC very soon. Developers faxdoc, happyquared, sunnydaze, and publisher Playism have confirmed that Rusted Moss will land on PC via Steam on April 12.
This twin-stick, side-scrolling shooter has some definite Metroid vibes. With the same sort of grid-based map and world to explore, it feels a bit familiar. But its own unique quality lies in the grappling hook.
One of Rusted Moss&#x27; core features is a grapple, letting the protagonist Fern hook and swing across the world. That, plus big guns, makes for a pretty fast and active side-scrolling shooter.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iteSJWwSaAg
It&#x27;s a full-on twin-stick shooter too, so no limits on what direction you can point. Add in some big, chaotic boss fights, and this feels like a search-action game made for folks who want a little more adrenaline in their secret hunting.
The hook brings you back
I&#x27;ve played the demo for Rusted Moss a few times, at PAX and through events like Steam demo festivals. Heck, the demo for Rusted Moss has stayed live and is playable right now if you head over to the store page.
Each time, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the mix of movement and shooting that feels like it&#x27;s got shades of Titanfall or Spider-Man. It&#x27;s punishing in a good way, though I definitely recommend tinkering with the grapple options to find the playstyle that suits you best.
With April looking a little light compared to the heavy-hitters of May and June, it might be a good time to check out a smaller title like Rusted Moss. The demo&#x27;s there either way, and if it hooks you in, the full game hits on April 12.

                              <span>Coziness and melancholy
Assemble Entertainment has announced Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale, a follow-up to solo-dev Moral Anxiety Studio’s 2022 narrative adventure, Roadwarden. Windy Meadow bills itself as a “counterpart” to Roadwarden rather than a sequel or spin-off.
Did you play Roadwarden? I completely missed it. Looking at it now, I think I’m going to need to make time for it. The publisher calls it as a “slice of life” narrative where you immerse yourself in the goings-on of a small community where decisions matter.
https://youtu.be/P6VRhcTW3k4
What interests me about Windy Meadow is that, although it’s considered a visual novel, “99%” of the text is dialogue. The visuals instead do the heavy lifting of communicating what’s happening. While I understand why developers use static images to communicate their stories since video games are a visual medium, that tends to go unutilized by the genre. So, that’s something I’d like to see experimented with.
The publisher says the narrative “seamlessly weaves coziness and melancholy,” which is also how I’d describe eating a sandwich from Arby’s in bed. The story puts you in the footwear of three separate protagonists, with different paths for each.
Sound fantastic. I’m probably going to pick up Roadwarden soon, but if you’re more interested in what you’re hearing here, there’s a demo available starting today.
Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale will release for PC sometime this year.

Cuisineer is an interesting game. On its surface, it&#x27;s a straightforward mash-up of two excellent things: a shop management sim and a dungeon-crawling action RPG. These two concepts are great on their own, and they go great together in Cuisineer too.
At PAX East 2023, I had a chance to go hands-on with BattleBrew Productions&#x27; Cuisineer to see how far the project has advanced. This actually wasn&#x27;t my first time demoing the game; I stopped by the team&#x27;s booth at East in 2022 to get a sampler of their restaurant manager/dungeon crawler mash-up. This year, they were under the XSEED banner and looked even more polished.

                              <span>It deserves the comeback
Back in 2014 I covered a game from Grumpyface Studios called Castle Doombad. I&#x27;m already a sucker for projects featuring traps as the core mechanic, but Doombad was sleek, cute, and a blast to play in short bursts or long sessions. Sadly, like many mobile games of that era (particularly under the Adult Swim banner), it was eventually put out to pasture. Given that it&#x27;s miraculously coming back this year on Steam (self-published by Grumpyface no less), it&#x27;ll likely have a longer shelf life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ix66i9eYX4M
In what is still a fun twist, you&#x27;re playing the role of the bad guy (Dr. Lord Evilstein). Much like a tower defense game or an action trapper like Deception or Orcs Must Die, your job is to use all sorts of gadgets (mounted on walls, the floor, or the ceiling) and minions to defend your castle. It has a really striking cartoony aesthetic to back it all up, and seeing Dr. Lord Evilstein cradle his fingers as he operates within the confines of his private office will never get old for me.
Here&#x27;s what the 2023 version has that the original mobile release didn&#x27;t:
Remastered/remade visuals
35 traps/minions to use
Gamepad/mouse and keyboard support
New content
Live now on Steam in wishlist form, it&#x27;s set to debut later in 2023. There&#x27;s also a website with links to the team&#x27;s Discord channel and Twitter accounts. Even if the new content isn&#x27;t substantial, I hope a ton of people get to play this clever creation for the first time.

                              <span>The HD-2D revival heads to more platforms
Classic RPG Live A Live is heading to more platforms. The HD-2D remake of the Super Famicom classic is getting ported to PlayStation 4 and PS5, as well as PC via Steam, on April 27.
Square Enix released the HD-2D remake of Live A Live last year, and it was certainly a bit of a surprise. This RPG with multiple &quot;paths&quot; and protagonists had long eluded the west. The Switch release not only brought it over, but revitalized it with some quality-of-life updates and revamped graphics.
Now, PlayStation and Steam users can experience the journey themselves. Live A Live will go for $49.99, though there&#x27;s a $10 off pre-order bonus running right now. Also, all platforms are getting a demo, which is currently live right now for PS4, PS5, and Steam. It sounds like it&#x27;s a similar demo to the Switch version, letting you try out the Wild West, Edo Japan, and Distant Future sections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;SjQPmA-QmeU
The remake includes remastered music from Yoko Shimomura too, and let me tell you: the version of &quot;Megalomania&quot; in the Live A Live update is absolutely phenomenal.
More lives to lead
If you&#x27;re completely unfamiliar, Live A Live follows several different heroes throughout the eras and their individual journeys, as they eventually come together to fight a greater evil. If that sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because yes, Octopath Traveler owes a fair bit to the original Live A Live.
What makes Live A Live such an interesting game is that each era has its own mechanics and systems, making their playthroughs remarkably distinct. The Edo Japan period is a Metal Gear-style castle infiltration, while Present Day is basically RPG Street Fighter. It&#x27;s a really interesting game for RPG fans to dig into, and something that we found still largely succeeds almost three decades later.
Live A Live arrives on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam on April 27.

Pokemon&#x27;s ninth generation has taken gamers to Paldea, a region bursting with adventures to embark on and treasures to find. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet differ from prior titles as they offer more freedom than ever; allowing players to complete three separate storylines in whatever order they please. The upcoming DLC, titled The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, will expand the Pokemon journey with new creatures, locations, and mysteries to unravel.
Thus far, gamers have only received a brief trailer of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, but it has already sparked plenty of excitement and anticipation. There is still a bit of a wait ahead, as the first half of the DLC only launches in Spring this year. However, there is plenty you can do in preparation for upcoming adventures.

                              <span>Stay frosty
Deadpan Games and Gaziter&#x27;s deckbuilder Wildfrost has locked in a release date. The charming card strategy sets out on a treacherous climb on April 12 for PC and Nintendo Switch.
Wildfrost sets you out on a perilous journey up through the mountains, with only a deck full of companions and items by your side. You&#x27;re trying to reach the Sun Temple to bring back the sunlight, so until then, everything&#x27;s going to be a bit chilly.

It&#x27;s a roguelite, where each run will net you new boons and assistance back in town. This can range from new cards to special effects, letting your squad get stronger and stronger until the summit doesn&#x27;t seem so far away after all.
Alongside building up the town of Snowdwell for more cards and challenges, there are also Leaders to use from different tribes, each with their own playstyle. And the counter system is a neat way of encouraging you to pay attention to cards&#x27; stats and weaknesses, beyond just a numbers game.
I can go the distance
I played a bit of Wildfrost during the Steam Next Fest a while back and found it to be fun and lighthearted, while still providing me a decent challenge. The art style is very memorable, especially if you&#x27;ve grown tired of the more grim takes on deckbuilding out there.
And with a $19.99 price tag, it seems pretty likely you can get a good hour-to-dollar count ratio out of this one. If you&#x27;re looking for another deckbuilder to eat up the hours, Wildfrost might just be the fit when it arrives on April 12. A demo is also available on the Nintendo eShop.

The launch of Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 is coming up in May, and CyberConnect2 has dropped a new patch for Fuga: Melodies of Steel to smooth things along for anyone new to the series. The patch consists of some substantial quality-of-life changes that should address bigger issues not rooted in its core design.
https://youtu.be/sPbeOSArJBI
The most important change is probably the “retry option.” One of the core mechanics of Fuga: Melodies of Steel is the soul cannon, which allows you to load a child into it and fire them at any enemy for an instant kill – even bosses. The downside is this prevents you from reaching the “true ending,” because what brilliant monster uses children as ammunition? The retry option will allow you to start over from chapt…</span>

Bloomberg has revealed that Sony’s new PlayStation VR2 Headset is projected to sell fewer than 300,000 units by the end of March. How much less? Well, PSVR2 is on track to hit 270,000. This is according to estimates from the International Data Corporation, a research firm that tracks these sorts of things.
Considering that Sony was looking to make 2 million units in its first three months (though it reportedly slashed this to 1 million and then refuted those reports), this is a pretty disappointing start. IDC analyst Francisco Geronimo has said that a price cut will be needed to avert disaster since many countries are facing a cost-of-living crisis, and many large corporations have announced massive layoffs in recent months.
My job involves covering video games, and I can’t justify the cost of VR. If I could, I’d want one to use on my PC, and the PSVR2 is locked entirely to the PS5. If I dug up buried treasure and was able to afford more than one VR headset, I’d still be hesitant to buy a PSVR2 since I don’t have the space to have a bunch of VR headsets lying around. So, in summary, if Sony wants me to have a PSVR2, it should not only just give me one but also buy me a house so I have the space for it.
For people who already have money and a house, PSVR2 has been marred by a shortage of available games and a complete lack of backward compatibility for PSVR1 games. Due to cost issues, VR is already a niche market, and Sony seems to be content with making it niche-er. I’m not a CEO, but when you take an already small market and try to take a slice of a smaller slice, then I don’t see how 2 million can happen. It doesn’t matter how fancy your tech is.
I guess what I’m trying to say is: Virtual reality? In this economy?
PSVR2 released on February 22, 2023 for a suggested price of $550.

A great NIS game is coming back in style to usher in this week of the Nintendo eShop, and it&#x27;s none other than GrimGrimoire OnceMore. If the title didn&#x27;t clue you in, this is a new version of 2007&#x27;s GrimGrimoire (which, in classic Vanillaware/NIS fashion around that time, was a PS2 exclusive). It&#x27;s actually out on April 4, and we&#x27;ll have a review for you to peruse around launch time.
What&#x27;s on the horizon for the Nintendo Switch?
That&#x27;s it for this week really in terms of marquee releases.
So what&#x27;s next for Nintendo? Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is out on April 21, but everyone is just sort of waiting for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to hit on May 12. Expect that entire month to be dominated by Zelda!

                              <span>A dire future
The Last Worker gives a unique perspective within the dystopian genre: a warehouse delivery employee for a monolithic organization. As the title suggests, you&#x27;re the last person that hasn&#x27;t been fired from this vital organization. Robots have replaced nearly everyone else at the company. However, as you find secrets about the shadowy owner, you&#x27;re thrust into an investigation that can change the world forever.
With a concept like this, The Last Worker thankfully nails the storytelling with a thought-provoking script and impactful performances all around. Somehow, the developers Oiffy and Wolf &amp; Wood Interactive make the act of organizing boxes entertaining, but with a time limit, it can feel frustratingly sluggish to control the character&#x27;s levitating seat.

                              <span>The company also plans to review its real-estate footprint
EA has announced it will be laying off roughly 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort.
Electronic Arts&#x27; most recent reports (via GamesIndustry.biz) put that number around 775. The publisher is also taking a look at its real estate and shifting its strategy.
&quot;As we drive greater focus across our portfolio, we are moving away from projects that do not contribute to our strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint, and restructuring some of our teams,&quot; said CEO Andrew Wilson in a note to staff.
&quot;This is the most difficult part, and we are working through the process with the utmost care and respect. Where we can, we are providing opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;Where that&#x27;s not possible, we are providing severance pay and additional benefits such as health care and career transition services.&quot;
EA started informing employees earlier in the quarter, and the publisher expects to be informing more affected workers into the next fiscal year, starting April 1.
Additionally, Wilson said the company is &quot;operating from a position of strength&quot; and will be focusing on a handful of priorities moving forward. This includes building games with large communities, making the most of those communities with social and creator tools, and creating blockbuster interactive storytelling.
More tech layoffs
Some cuts to the workforce at EA were already made earlier this year, as over 200 QA staff working on Apex Legends were laid off recently from the Baton Rouge team.
Meanwhile, Respawn recently announced a new studio to bolster Apex Legends development in Madison, Wisconsin.

Wargroove is back with its sequel Wargroove 2, a surprise follow-up that returns to the tile-based tactics. And while it&#x27;s hitting many of the same notes as its predecessor, we got to go hands-on with its new spin on turn-based warfare: the Conquest mode.
The Conquest mode is one of Wargroove 2&#x27;s big new features. It&#x27;s a roguelike approach to battles that follows a familiar structure if you&#x27;ve ever played other styles of roguelike. Yet for all the familiarity of this concept, it wound up being a pretty refreshing take on the turn-by-turn fights of Wargroove.

                              <span>Normally we expect to pay around £200 for a mid-range gaming monitor, but today you can pick one up for just £149 after a significant discount in Amazon&#x27;s Spring Sale. This is a great price for the Samsung Odyssey G3, a 27-in flat VA panel monitor that boasts a 165Hz refresh rate, 1080p resolution and excellent adjustability.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that ground pound attacks are better than reloads dumping unspent ammo. 60% against 40%, that one, which is a satisfying outcome. Chunky disagreement but a clear outcome. This week, I ask you to think carefully about two quite different cycles, one repeating and one resuming. What&#x27;s better: time loops, or resuming interrupted reloads?

That makes it a great time to pick up a mouse that&#x27;s like three models in one...

                              <span>Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year&#x27;s cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn&#x27;t get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC&#x27;s website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.

                              <span>Are you a fan of RPGs where you make friends with adorable critters? Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It&#x27;s a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

Last week, Polish site Bankier spoke with Bloober Team’s CEO Pitor Babieno in an interview that was mistranslated and began to circulate online. The mistranslations mentioned the remake was “technically ready” for launch, but Bloober Team have clarified these “statements have been taken out of context, due to inaccurate translations.”

                              <span>There’s always been something quaintly practical about the name Command &amp; Conquer. Sure, there’s a touch of Julius Caesar’s ‘veni, vidi, vici’ in there. But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

                              <span>Waking up in a room you don&#x27;t recognise with a camera trained on you: the result of a heavy Saturday night, or the opening salvo in an inexplicable kidnapping? In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it&#x27;s definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company. It was enough to staple this game right into the middle of my disorganised Charlie Day conspiracy board of games I&#x27;m interested in, I&#x27;ll tell you that much.

                              <span>The federal government in Australia have today proposed a number of changes to their National Classification Scheme as they seek to crack down on digital gambling and video games that promote it. The proposed changes would apply an R18+ (over 18s) rating to any game with simulated gambling, and an M for “mature” (over 15s) rating to any games with paid loot boxes, potentially changing the classification for games such as FIFA which were previously G-rated (for everyone).

Like any D&amp;D campaign, the crossover begins around a blocky table with an open pizza box, and then it escalates into a roughly ten-hour, action-RPG take on Minecraft as you trek through the classic tabletop’s fantasy world.

                              <span>Sad horror? Misery?
If you’re like me, you enjoy your horror best when it’s sad. Video games can’t really scare me anymore, but gosh, they sure can get me depressed. Not that it’s difficult. A happy memory can depress me.
Anyway, a portion of Mortal Meal was featured on the Haunted PS1 Demo Disc: Spectral Mall compilation that was released back in 2022. The Haunted PS1 Demo Disc is sort of a nexus for experimental, lo-fi horror, and somehow I’m not on their mailing list. Thankfully, it usually passes my radar eventually.
Mortal Meal is perhaps a direct take on the genre, being largely a walking simulator. It’s also not terribly scary, but then, how would I know? It’s more focused on telling a melancholic narrative while weaving in a bit of levity and some fantastic horror imagery.

                              <span>One small slice has me ready for the whole thing
This week, we got a solid look at Link&#x27;s next adventure in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It was a roughly 10-minute slice of gameplay, the most we&#x27;ve seen of the game thus far. And for me, I don&#x27;t think I need to see any more of it until launch.
Zelda&#x27;s gameplay showcase, hosted by series producer Eiji Aonuma, might seem unassuming compared to other big gameplay spotlights. It had the same tenor as the character reveals for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; rather than make a big production or splice together a sizzle reel, it was just a chopped-and-guided tour through the new Hyrule. For one of year&#x27;s biggest presumptive hits, it was a chill stream that let the game speak for itself. And it really did talk.

                              <span>It&#x27;s July 1, 2023 at Anime Expo
Several weeks ago, Atlus unveiled the existence of a Shin Megami Tensei 30th anniversary concert called &quot;Band of Shadows.&quot; Held at Anime Expo 2023 in July in Los Angeles, this is billed as the &quot;first ever live anniversary concert for Atlus in the west.&quot; It&#x27;ll focus on Shin Megami Tensei works, and not the Persona series: the focus of most of the company&#x27;s concert-based events in the past.
Interestingly, the concert is also getting the backing of voice actors from the series who will host and appear at the event, including: Christian La Monte (Demi-fiend – Shin Megami Tensei III), Casey Mongillo (Nahobino – Shin Megami Tensei V), and Daman Mills (Aogami – Shin Megami Tensei V).
According to Atlus, doors will open at 6:30PM PT on July 1, and again, tickets are exclusively tied to Anime Expo attendees. Pre-sale tickets are live now, and you can get them here.

Ticket pricing tiers for the Shin Megami Tensei Anime Expo concert:
VIP Pit (Standing) &#x3D; $95
VIP Balcony &#x3D; $85
GA Floor (Standing) &#x3D; $70
GA Balcony &#x3D; $50
Similar to many Comic-Cons and the like, there&#x27;s an add-on, too:
&quot;A pre-show reception is scheduled and will feature early access to concert merchandise, a meet-and-greet with the show hosts, a themed autograph card signed by the show hosts, light hors d&#x27;oeuvres, and more. The pre-show reception will have limited availability and is a $125 add-on to all concert ticket purchases.&quot;

                              <span>Also, Meet Your Maker and Tails of Iron
Warm up your network card, Sony has announced their offerings for their “Essential” Tier offerings for all PlayStation Plus subscribers. Free for the month of April will be Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron.

Beginning with Sackboy: The Big Adventure, this 2020 LittleBigPlanet spin-off was described as Destructoid’s resident snack-cake, Chris Carter, as a “chill platformer.” It ditches the creation suite that was such a focus of the LittleBigPlanet games to instead create a unique and charming platformer.

Next up is Meet Your Maker from Behaviour Interactive. This title is currently unreleased, so it you’ll be able to grab it free on its launch date if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Behaviour Interactive describes it as a first-person build and raid game. It has a co-op and base-building focus, so it’s something to grab if you need a game to share with a friend. If you have one.

Finally, Tails of Iron is a Souls-like action-RPG, that Destructoid’s resident tough-lad, Chris Moyse, described as one of the most distinctive RPG experiences of 2021.
There’s nothing on this list that strikes me as something I need to download and play right away, but they’re all welcome additions to the library. Sackboy and Tails of Iron are both well-loved titles, while Meet Your Maker still needs to prove itself in the crucible of opinion.
Sackboy: The Big Adventure, Meet Your Maker, and Tails of Iron will be available to all PlayStation Plus subscribers on April 4, 2023 until May 1.

                              <span>Expanding the world of Forspoken
Square Enix&#x27;s Forspoken is getting a little more story. The special story DLC &quot;In Tanta We Trust&quot; arrives for Forspoken on PS5 and PC on May 26.
The DLC will dive into the world of Athia and its past, before the events of the main game. As Square Enix describes it, this DLC will show the battle that drove the Tantas to madness.
https://twitter.com/Forspoken/status/1641062989724884994/
The DLC will be up for purchase on May 26, and will also be available for owners of the Digital Deluxe Edition of Forspoken. If you got that version, you&#x27;ll also get a few days&#x27; early access to the DLC.
A new view of Athia
Forspoken was one of the first big games of 2023, and received a fairly lukewarm reception. In our own look at the game, it seems like Forspoken plays it safe in many areas, but does have some neat visuals and cool concept for its combat.
Still, that&#x27;s not always enough to save a game from the fallout. Square Enix announced that Luminous Productions, after launching Forspoken, is being absorbed into Square Enix. The publisher also characterized sales of Forspoken as &quot;lackluster,&quot; and review of it were &quot;challenging.&quot;
Meanwhile, Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda confirmed he&#x27;s stepping down in June, with current company director Takashi Kiryu stepping up pending shareholder approval. It&#x27;s a season of change for Square Enix, as some games miss marks and leadership shifts around, following a year where the company sold off some big studios.
The Forspoken story DLC In Tanta We Trust will drop for PS5 and PC on May 26.

Wizards of the Coast is still rolling with multiple Magic: The Gathering sets each year (for both paper Magic and digital variants like Magic: Arena), and the next set, March of the Machine, is ready to debut in April.
There are some heavy-hitting artists backing this set, including the always fantastic Magali Villeneuve: who I would consider one of the greatest artists in the history of Magic. You can get a look at some spoiler cards for March of the Machine below, as well as some full art. The full story of the set can be read here.
March of the Machine is out on April 21, 2023 in full, with pre-release events starting on April 14, and a digital release on April 18.

After word got around about Bloober Team&#x27;s remake of Silent Hill 2, the studio has released a statement clarifying certain details about the game&#x27;s forecast and readiness.
In the statement, Bloober says it doesn&#x27;t comment on rumors, but felt the need to clarify recent statements that were &quot;taken out of context, due to inaccurate translations.&quot;
This arrives after an interview with Bankier.pl was circled online, in statements that appear to have been mistranslated. Bloober says the company&#x27;s messages did not contain sales forecasts of specific titles, and that figure connected to Silent Hill 2 refer to the &quot;potential success&quot; of the type of games it will be focusing on in the future.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom had its first gameplay demonstration from Nintendo, reintroducing fans to the world of Hyrule with roughly 10 minutes of gameplay. There were many fantastic moments and reveals in this presentation, ranging from each of the new powers to the islands in the sky.

Even within the relatively brief gameplay demonstration for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, there are several standout moments that happen. Here are the 10 best situations and reveals that happened during the recent presentation in no particular order.

                              <span>The phoenix rises
That was fast. Bandai Namco has dropped yet another trailer for Tekken 8, this one focusing on Ling Xiaoyu. Ling was previously unannounced for the game, so this trailer is a big reveal for her. I’m mostly just surprised that this happened so quickly after Jun Kazama capped off the reveal trailers for their already-revealed cast.
This maybe shouldn’t be a huge surprise. Ling Xiaoyu was introduced way back in Tekken 3 and has been in every entry since. She initially wanted to win enough money to build her own amusement park but eventually got wrapped up in the family drama of the Kazama family.
https://youtu.be/vTd2XeL4ygQ
The trailer shows Ling Xiaoyu kicking her winged slippers at Nina Williams and King, who commenters have pointed out were her foes in the Tekken: Bloodline anime. Much of the time, she’s wearing her trademark smile right up until she gets mad and nukes King’s well-developed abs.
Ling Xiaoyu gets the spotlight after the previously shown characters: Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, and Jun Kazama. Bandai Namco hasn’t said how large the roster is going to be, exactly, but they’ve certainly got a brisk pace going on with these trailers.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024.

Game Freak and Nintendo are no stranger to Pokemon promos: whether they require you to go to a retail location or not. This newest one unfortunately is the former; and oh, it&#x27;s also tied to GameStop. Just like the flying Pikachu doled out at the launch of the new generation, this promo Pokemon is also in flight: and it&#x27;s a pig. Get it?! With April Fools&#x27; coming up, you know someone couldn&#x27;t resist. Yep, it&#x27;s a flying tera type Lechonk.
If you follow the GameStop link in the announcement tweet, you&#x27;ll just get a generic &quot;find a GameStop in my area&quot; landing page. But TCG site Pokebeach has more info, noting that the codes will be available in stores on March 31, in an effort to tie it to the Scarlet &amp; Violet new TCG set. Welp, marketing kinda botched that connection! Pokebeach says that there is no purchase necessary for these promo cards (as in the past), which will provide a code to download the flying Lechonk.
There&#x27;s also a separate promo going on featuring the Pokemon TCG, which is potentially linked to a $15 in-store purchase, as a reverse holo card. I say &quot;potentially&quot; because individual stores might not require said purchase, but that&#x27;s going to be up to the stores themselves.
Either way, you can get a free Lechonk. Maybe you already have 20.

A game like Demonschool feels like the kind of mash-up that makes obvious sense in hindsight. Tactics games are quite popular, as are their often-accompanying social mechanics and life-sim elements. So combining demons and school makes sense.
But Demonschool is a lot more than the sum of its parts. It&#x27;s a sleek, engaging tactics game that gets right to the thick of things. It&#x27;s a school life sim that easily slots into the overall drives of the story. And it&#x27;s a game I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about since my two playthroughs at PAX East 2023.

                              <span>Yasunori Mitsuda has worked on dozens of games since the mid-90s, but he is best known for his work on Chrono Trigger. The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. &quot;[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he&#x27;s like, &#x27;Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…</span>

                              <span>Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23.

It&#x27;s been more than eight years since Tekken 7 arrived in arcades across the globe. While the console version didn&#x27;t hit for another two years, the gap since that seventh entry represents the largest distance between two mainline entries since the series began in 1994. Bandai Namco used that time to evolve the experience, adding several new characters by way of DLC en route to the announcement of a highly anticipated eighth entry.
With so much time since Tekken 7 launched, Tekken 8 represents not only the franchise&#x27;s first game developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, but als…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Deck 13 revealed that its upcoming action RPG, Atlas Fallen, would arrive May. Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. 
More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

The numbers shared then were very promising and since then I&#x27;ve had more time looking at the performance impact of Intel&#x27;s stellar software optimization work and its impact on real-world workloads. Here is a look at how Intel&#x27;s pending kernel optimization patches are a huge deal for today&#x27;s high core count servers.</span>

                              <span>Released earlier today, The Last Of Us: Part 1&#x27;s long-awaited PC port is being torn apart in Steam reviews. It currently sits at a &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; rating after nearly 3000 reviews, with players reporting regular crashes and plentiful performance issues.

                              <span>Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer&#x27;s previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they&#x27;re doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

                              <span>Company Of Heroes 3 had rough beach landing, garnering mostly positive reviews from critics (like us) and mixed-to-negative reviews from players on Steam. Today&#x27;s release of its first major update, titled Operation Sapphire Jackal, may help address that disparity given that it promises to fix &quot;hundreds&quot; of bugs in the base game. On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

                              <span>Whoa, these Amazon Spring Sale deals keep rolling in. This one is a cracker though - you can now pick up a 28-inch 4K monitor for just £181, a great choice for anyone that plays slower-paced PC or console games, or wants a high-quality 4K monitor for content creation and consumption. This Lenovo IPS monitor normally costs £260, so to get it for nearly £80 less is quite a scoop.

                              <span>The Lenovo Legion 5 is a laptop that I&#x27;ve recommended here at RPS on several occasions, as it gets excellent reviews online yet still provides much better specs and build quality than you&#x27;d expect for the money. 
Today though, the Legion 5 is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen on an RTX gaming laptop, with this spec including a Ryzen 5 5600H and RTX 3060 Laptop graphics card for just £730.98 when you use code CATCH20 at CCL&#x27;s web store on Ebay. That&#x27;s an exceptional price for a brand new laptop that&#x27;s still selling for £1100 at Amazon - Spring Sale or no.

                              <span>One last Amazon Spring Sale highlight from me today, readers, and I’m happy to say it’s a very personal recommendation. I’ve been using the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless almost every day since putting them on our best gaming headsets list – that was in June last year, and today, it’s a solid £70 off in the UK.

                              <span>After weeks of teases and rumours, Counter-Strike 2 invaded the internet to confirm that, yes, it was a real thing and not a figment of the community&#x27;s shared imagination. It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel&#x27;s announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.

                              <span>The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson claimed that &quot;the mark of a good action is that it appears inevitable in retrospect.&quot; Had he not died in 1894, he might’ve said the same thing about the Logitech G502 Hero showing up in Amazon sales events, although maybe it wouldn’t have sounded as profound.


That’s right, the G502 Hero – beloved by RPS readers, a longtime resident in our best gaming mouse list, and precursor to an inferior new model – is once again going cheap. A predictable development, albeit an entirely welcome one. This time it’s in the Amazon Spring Sale, with a better-than-half-price discount bringing it down to £35.

This feels like that. It&#x27;s like a fake game made up by a Hollywood television  producer.&quot;
A few hours later, after numerous short cutscenes in which Michael Rooker has to shout nonsensical American Football metaphors every so often, to justify the fact that his character is called Touchdown, and Michael Madsen growls about &quot;candy&quot; in a hard-living 65-year-old&#x27;s voice coming out of an uncanny-vallyy 35-year-old&#x27;s face, I text him an update: &quot;It&#x27;s also like that tweet that goes &#x27;Bames Nond&#x27;s having a stronk, call a bondulance&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Tax Heaven 3000 changed its release date a couple of times, moving from a March 31st date that was suspiciously close to April Fools&#x27; Day, to April 4th after its removal from Steam, to yesterday, March 27th. For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.

After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on older versions of the Windows OS. The reason? It’s Google Chrome.

                              <span>As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he&#x27;s certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. &quot;You want him to get attacked,&quot; game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase &#x27;you wouldn&#x27;t like him when he&#x27;s angry&#x27; as the basis for Fedir&#x27;s ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it&#x27;s just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.
In truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes&#x27; latest game actually works. It&#x27;s quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here&#x27;s how the game&#x27;s emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.

                              <span>Rejoice, fellow Nintendoers! Dolphin Emulator - the open-source emulator for Nintendo GameCube and Wii games - is coming to Steam in Q2 2023. The Steam page is quick to note, for probably legal reasons, that “this app does not come with games” and “you must own an original copy of any game” you want to emulate. Dolphin allows you to emulate retro games with 4k support, modern controllers, and it’s totally free.

Two seasons deep, the studio say they’re taking MultiVersus offline because it’s been in Open Beta this whole time (I know, shocker), so an extended break will give them time to prepare for their proper launch.

Romero’s acclaimed board game Train inspired the in-book video game Solution, by the author Gabrielle Zevin&#x27;s own admission, which resulted in Romero speaking out. The book’s publisher Knobf Doubleday have now issued a statement refusing to credit Romero since “the only games listed in the author’s acknowledgements are video games.”

Yacht Club Games has been the &quot;Shovel Knight studio&quot; for a long time. Since the blue knight first took up the spade, the studio has made and published many spin-offs. With Mina the Hollower, it&#x27;s trying something different. And a change of scenery feels like it&#x27;s ignited a spark for Yacht Club.
Rather than the themed side-scrolling platforming of Shovel Knight, Mina the Hollower takes directly after Game Boy treasures like The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening or the Oracle games. This was an overt direction Yacht Club went for, as a &quot;love letter&quot; to the Game Boy Color, as lead artist Sandy Gordon describes it.

                              <span>Welcome to the final days of Samurott
In case you haven’t heard, Samurott is joining the roster of Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet via a 7-Star Tera Raid Battle event. This event will run from March 31 to April 2, and it will repeat the following weekend from April 7 to April 9.
One of the most challenging aspects of 7-Star raids is sheer unpredictability. The moveset of any Pokemon can completely change which monster will counter it best, so it’s almost impossible to prepare for an event before it goes live. For example, Samurott is a Water-Type Pokemon with a Bug Tera Type, which means Flying-Type Pokemon should be the best counters. However, if Samurott knows an Ice-Type move, the best Pokemon may be Walking Wake with Flamethrower or a Skill Link Cloyster with Rock Blast.

Splatoon 3 is keeping up the same cute marketing campaign as it has in the past: adding &quot;SplatNet&quot; rewards that require scanning in a QR code. This one, released in late March 2023, involves a &quot;Boston-themed banner.&quot; No, it&#x27;s not a Dunkin Donuts/Ben Affleck promo. But there is a lobster (lobstah?) involved.

Said banner is Boston-themed because of the recent Splatoon 3 tournament sponsored by Nintendo: which was held at PAX East this past weekend in Boston, Massachusetts. Team Starburst beat out team Destiny Bond with a sweep, becoming the winners of the 2023 Splatoon 3 North American Championship. Hey look, it&#x27;s a free gift! Take it or leave it.
Scan this QR code for the Splatoon 3 Boston reward:
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_371169&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;512&quot;] Image via Nintendo[/caption]
First off, you can’t just scan the QR code with your camera app on your phone. You’ll need to go download the Nintendo Switch Online app on either iOS or Android.
Once you have the app, load it up, log into your Nintendo Switch Online account, and look for the Splatoon 3 icon at the top. That’s actually “Splatnet 3,” and it’s the app-within-the-app that you’ll need to use to scan the below codes.
After Splatnet 3 loads, scroll to the bottom and look for the “QR Code Reader” icon.
Select “use your smartphone’s camera to scan a QR code” to directly scan codes from this article, or select “scan a QR code from a saved image” (you may need to give your app access to your phone’s camera or image collection).
That’s it! The code will then redeem and you’ll be able to pick the reward up from the in-game terminal. Depending on the size of the code you may need to move your camera around a bit.

                              <span>Artificial intelligence is now a mainstream topic but while most people focus on the positives, the music industry is concerned about potential threats. In IFPI&#x27;s latest Global Music Report, insiders stress that music&#x27;s &#x27;human&#x27; element should stay at the forefront. According to Sony, the same applies to AI-synthesized voices, which should not replace human vocals.

                              <span>A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

If you’re in the market for a new OLED model, this Zelda variant launches on April 28, a couple of weeks before the game arrives. It retails at $359.99 and features a Switch dock and Joy-Cons adorned with Hyrulian designs. 
Additionally, a Tears of the Kingdom-themed Pro Controller ($74.99) and Switch carrying case ($24.99) will release alongside the game on May 12. 
According to a press release, the console and accessories are available for pre-order today (check with your preferred retailer). Meanwhile, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches for Switch on May 12.</span>

                              <span>Development on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now complete.
The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today&#x27;s Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the &quot;Recall&quot; power, which rewinds an object&#x27;s movement, to reverse a fallen rock&#x27;s descent. He&#x27;s able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link&#x27;s new &quot;Fuse&quot; ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…</span>

                              <span>E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that&#x27;s the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

                              <span>MultiVersus, the free-to-play Super Smash Bros. style fighting game starring an all-star cast of Warner Bros. characters, will be pulled from storefronts next month. The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

                              <span>December 25, 2013, was the day I finally got my hands on a Wii U. It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …</span>

To watch the video when it premieres tomorrow on YouTube, just click the Link below:
Despite the fact that we&#x27;ve gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow&#x27;s showcase addresses those questions, we&#x27;ll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We&#x27;ll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer&#x27;s Twitch channel.</span>

                              <span>I like to think I have rhythm, in the same way that a wobbly air dancer lunging about sporadically has rhythm. That is to say I have none at all, and that any time spent dancing turns me into an uncontrollable set of limbs flailing in the wrong directions. Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

                              <span>A long time ago (in 2013, in fact) in a student-y house far away (assuming that you don&#x27;t live too near to Nottingham), I started playing the BioShock series. I&#x27;d flirted with the idea for years, but it was the release of BioShock Infinite that finally convinced me to take the plunge. And I can&#x27;t exactly complain: the series&#x27; Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John &quot;The Crow&quot; Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I&#x27;d actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

                              <span>It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we&#x27;re talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can&#x27;t focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven&#x27;t played. Sometimes it&#x27;s because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site&#x27;s knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I&#x27;m not really interested in playing, either because they&#x27;re not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it&#x27;s because everyone says they&#x27;re really good and I have to try them, though I&#x27;ve been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it&#x27;s just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

Happily, the open world detective sim is now sneaking into an early access release next month, on April 24th.

                              <span>Terra Nil is a puzzle-citybuilder about reclaiming the environment. You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

                              <span>Slay The Spire has remained an incredibly popular deckbuilding roguelike, so it naturally invited a healthy modding community that added fun stuff to the game - goofy googley eyes included. One of Slay The Spire’s most popular mods was called Downfall, a huge fan-made expansion that added tons of playable characters, a new mode, and more. Those developers - Table 9 Studio - are now back with their own not-modded game: an auto-battling, fantasy Chess roguelike called Tales &amp; Tactics.

                              <span>Rod Humble has his son to thank for his upcoming life sim Life By You. After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn&#x27;t quite sure what. &quot;I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, &#x27;Oh, what should I do? I don&#x27;t know what opportunities there are,&#x27; and he was like, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?&#x27;&quot; And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. &quot;Okay!?&quot; Humble says incredulously. &quot;I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I&#x27;d like to start a studio, and here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;d like to run it. And he was like, sure, let&#x27;s go for it.&quot;
So began Humble&#x27;s journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that&#x27;s set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it&#x27;s currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they&#x27;ve always wanted. &quot;I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,&quot; says Humble. &quot;Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.&quot; And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

                              <span>I keep alternating between wanting to play more and feeling weary at the prospect. While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it&#x27;s balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.
The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It&#x27;s a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It&#x27;s perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a fan of The Sims 4 and your ears pricked up during this month&#x27;s reveal of Paradox Interactive&#x27;s upcoming life sim Life By You, you might want to check your PC&#x27;s specifications before it enters early access later this year. During a chat with Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s general manager Rod Humble at this year&#x27;s GDC, I spoke to him about whether there was any plan to accommodate lower-end PC specifications when Life By You enters early access this September, and he answered by urging players to take its minimum PC specifications &quot;seriously&quot;.

                              <span>You might have heard of Dark And Darker, a dungeon-crawling take on Escape From Tarkov’s PvPvE that’s been gaining popularity over the last few months. Alice0 enjoyed its alpha playtest last December, and it ended up becoming one of the most popular games of February&#x27;s Steam Next Fest. It wasn&#x27;t due to launch in full until sometime this winter, but that window&#x27;s now up in the air after Dark And Darker was removed from Steam over the weekend, following a messy legal dispute between Nexon and developers Ironmace, who have been accused of “using trade secrets and copyrighted information,” allegedly stolen from Nexon.

                              <span>Jokes about Valve’s inability to count to three practically write themselves, but in fairness, the publisher have reportedly reached the mythical number in Counter-Strike 2’s files. The mention of “Left4Dead3” was recently spotted in CS2’s files (thanks, Reddit) which sparked online speculation for a third game in the series. The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

Po několika měsících se totiž opět objevily útoky s intenzitou vyšší než 150 Gbps. U průměrného útoku je přitom tato hodnota přibližně desetkrát menší. Zároveň již druhý měsíc po sobě nejvíce útoků míří z Ruska. Stále pak platí trend, že útočníci napadající servery provozující služby či internetové stránky více hledají úplně nové cesty svých DDoS útoků a prodlužují dobu jejich trvání.</span>

                              <span>Imagine for a moment, if you will, that Persona 5 let you suplex your opponents. Even better, imagine if those moves were pulled off through timing based minigames that resembled the battles found in Nintendo&#x27;s excellent (and underrated) Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. Sounds good, right? Well guess what, that game exists! It&#x27;s called Wrestle Story and it&#x27;s definitely a project to keep an eye on.


After spending twenty glorious minutes with its colourful demo at PAX East, I was keen to chat to creative director Steve Jimenez about the team&#x27;s inspirations, the challenges of translating wrestling into a turn-based RPG and the  exciting locations that players will attempt to liberate from a group of devious heels.

                              <span>Earlier in the week, Liam and I had the opportunity to chat with Animal Well&#x27;s solo developer and publisher Bigmode about creating their eerie subterranean world. We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS &#x27;Bestest Best in show&#x27; award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game&#x27;s dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler&#x27;s visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

                              <span>Show me a game about a feral, furry creature with a never ending hunger for junk food and I&#x27;m immediately interested. I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It&#x27;s like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There&#x27;s an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It&#x27;s goofy fun, and we&#x27;re completeley smitten with it.

                              <span>Liam and I had a fun time chatting with the folks over at Mega Cat Studios about their upcoming wrestling RPG WrestleQuest last year at PAX West, and this time at PAX East we finally cornered them in the ring for a proper interview.
Watch below to learn about how the developers created their zero to hero story, how they&#x27;re addressing myths and persaonl issues in the world of pro wresting, as well as sharing a story about how one of the team got their nose broken in a wrestling accident during development.
My main take away from the interview is how much of the RPG incorporates all aspects of Wrestling, not just the ring fights we see on TV. Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I&#x27;m sure.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a bunch of indie game demos at PAX East, but none left my head reeling as much as 43 Studios&#x27; fiendishly frantic action platfotmer Hell Of An Office. It&#x27;s a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:
Hell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you&#x27;re tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell&#x27;s scorching pools.
If you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it&#x27;s way through Early Access.

                              <span>Have A Nice Death&#x27;s dark art and quick-slashing combat bring Hollow Knight to mind, but it has more in common with Hades and Dead Cells. One of the things it has in common with those games is that it was released in early access. After a little more than a year, version 1.0 arrived this week, bringing a final area, a new boss, and the end of its storyline.

                              <span>Go-Go Town! has more than a little Animal Crossing about it, as players become mayor of a cutesy fixer-upper town and start doing oddjobs to attract new visitors and inhabitants. It differs in several key ways too, thankfully, from its more urban setting, its tactile power tools, and the ability to automate a lot of the gathering and crafting by putting residents to work for you. Watch the reveal trailer below.

Ten už v roce 1965 předpověděl, že počet tranzistorů, které mohou být umístěny na integrovaný obvod, se při zachování stejné ceny zhruba každých 18 měsíců zdvojnásobí. Později byl odhad upraven na zdvojnásobení každé dva roky, ale toto pravidlo zůstalo platné po mnoho desetiletí.</span>

                              <span>With Sci-Hub and Z-Library making headlines over the past few months and the Internet Archive&#x27;s legal battle still ongoing, publishers seem prepared to defend every last inch of their rights. That includes Cengage, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as they investigate what appears to be a blatant pirate ebook platform. A closer look reveals even more dubious activity.

                              <span>I somehow missed the news two weeks ago that Wargroove 2 was on the way. The actual successor to a spiritual successor to Advance Wars, Wargroove 2 is another 2D turn-based strategy game, but with new factions, a new roguelike mode, and a new co-developer.

There&#x27;s also a demo available to play right now, although only until the end of the weekend.

                              <span>I really enjoyed dark fantasy adventure Roki when it first released back in 2020, and keen to see what developers Polygon Treehouse have gotten up to since, I jumped at the opportunity to play the PAX East demo for Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island. You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:
In Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.
From playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse&#x27;s sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.

It&#x27;s a 2D metriodvania where you play as a little blob trying to navigate a subtterranean labyrinth filled with creatures - some cute, some not so cute. 
To find out more about this strange puzzle platformer&#x27;s beginnings and development, we spoke to solo develeoper Billy Basso and Bigmode&#x27;s Leah Gastrow which you can view in the two videos below.

Major book publishers successfully argued that the Archive&#x27;s lending of scanned books amounts to copyright infringement. In a decision published Friday, a New York federal judge found that the Archive&#x27;s fair use defenses weighed strongly against the digital book lending operation.

                              <span>Join us for another PAX East game highlight straight from the show floor, and this time we decided to revisit a cult horror classic: Alone In The Dark. This psychological horror is being developed by Pieces Interactive with publishing backing from THQ Nordic and is a love letter to the original game released back in the 90s.
As someone who had played the original, and RPS&#x27; Resident Evil uber fan, Liam decided to check out the demo and you can hear his impressions in the video below:
According to the devs at the THQ booth, this demo is a stand-alone prequel story that will not be in the final game, but shares the same eerie atmosphere and action that&#x27;ll be in the main game. This reimagining is set in the Gothic American south and in the main game you&#x27;ll be playing as Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood as they navigate the monster infested Derceto Manor, the same mansion featured in the demo.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had our eyes on Goodbye Volcano High since it appeared in Sony&#x27;s State Of Play back in February and the demo at PAX East is one of the first times that the devs have placed a game preview in the hands of eager players. I had the chance to sit down with the demo and play KO_OP&#x27;s teen dino adventure first hand. Check out the video below if you&#x27;re interested to know what I thought:
Goodbye Volcano High follows a group of teen dinos as they begin their senior year of highschool. It&#x27;s part coming-of-age visual novel part rhythm game as the group try to grapple with school while also trying to make it big as up-and-coming musicians.
I had a great time with the demo, and it looks like we won&#x27;t have to wait long for the full release at Goodbye Volcano High is launching on Steam and PlayStation on June 15th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost become an RPS tradition to search the show floor at PAX events and find the coolest stuff and highlight it in a video, so that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;ve done at PAX East. There&#x27;s a lot of cool booths, fun props, and generally weird stuff to see, so we&#x27;ve chosen our absolute favourites and have listed them in video form for your viewing pleasure.
Everything at PAX East is situated in one massive hall (instead of PAX West&#x27;s multiple floors, rooms, and buildings) so it&#x27;s nice and easy to see everything in one or two loops. It doesn&#x27;t feel cramped at all, even with Friday&#x27;s busy crowds, and the booths are as spectacular as ever.
Some of our favourites included Devolver Digital&#x27;s movie theatre-inspired booth, which has the new addition of a candle-lit shrine for Cult Of The Lamb&#x27;s upcoming free expansion Relics Of The Old Faith. We also loved Ysbryd Games&#x27; Demonschool booth which had a school desk layout and cool retro TV. Another favourite was the animated robot dinosaur (complete with rideable saddle) that we found at the Roots Of Pacha demo builds.

                              <span>“Imagine someone saying ‘We need you to make a trailer for our movie, but we&#x27;ve only got half of the sets and props ready…” says Tim Bevan de Lange, Creative Director at Realtime Nordic, a studio that makes, specifically, video game trailers. “...and we haven’t actually shot anything, so you’ll need to do that yourself. Some of the actors won&#x27;t come out of their trailers. One of them will but if you shoot him from the front you realise he&#x27;s got no eyes, but don&#x27;t show the audience that. It&#x27;s not intentional, he&#x27;s getting them fixed. Also can you film it twice, for different streaming platforms? Make a really good version for Netflix and a slightly worse looking one for Quibi.”


Every so often a game trailer comes along that makes me think, hang on, that was bloody brilliant! I bet some people made that! Most recently it was Creative Assembly’s Immortal Empires trailer. Well, I’ve been digging around and I’m happy to report that yes, although I’m the first one to just see a trailer as an algorithm trying to snatch my coin purse away like a manure-encrusted Victorian ne’er-do-well, game trailers are made by humans. They&#x27;re often humans who do it as as specific job, either in-house at a developer or as an outside agency like Realtime Nordic. Enlightened and enthralled, I asked some of them about what went into the strange space that is making the trailers for your favourite games.

                              <span>The Mercenaries DLC mode will be added to the Resident Evil 4 remake, for free, on April 7th. The full game launched today, so by the time you’re done gorging on the remake’s fancy additions, the new mode should be ready. Hopefully, you’re still in the mood to roundhouse kick waves of infected in two weeks&#x27; time.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t remember if I&#x27;ve already banged on about what a terrible, unhelpful term &quot;metroidvania&quot; is, so let&#x27;s skip past to say that Angel&#x27;s Gear reminds me of the one Castlevania game I&#x27;ve ever played.

It&#x27;s partly the tone: a compelling blend of gothic and biomechanical horror, with a 90s game boy goriness that&#x27;s cartoony enough to feel colourful rather than repulsive. &quot;Camp&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word, but a hint of melodrama gives the story severity without self-seriousness. I mean, within the first minute of the game, your soldier goes from a terrified Normandy-style amphibious assault on a fortified metal church to seeing their war made irrelevant when the moon explodes. The whole thing is kind of metal, to be honest.

                              <span>Everywhere (not to be confused with Everything) was a big fat question mark at last year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live. It comes from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by ex-GTA boss Leslie Benzies, and despite its cryptic reveal trailer, AliceB theorised it was some kind of Robloxlike. Turns out her hunch was correct - Everywhere is a platform that allows players to create their own custom content. To show off what the tools can do, Benzies and the team unveiled MindsEye, an episodic “blockbuster” adventure available inside Everywhere. A game set inside a game, if you will.

Perhaps you’ve become a self-sufficient blueberry empire, surviving off handfuls of fruit while cannibals knock at your door. Or maybe you’ve gone full Charlie Kelly, consuming tins of cat food found around the island. If so, it’s time for a diet cleanse. Sons Of The Forest’s newest patch adds a demon boss, a new cave system, and tons of other improvements. It’s also nerfing cat food, since it was overpowered and, well, are there actually any cats in the game?

Just like the first, Sludge Life 2 is a sticky graffiti vandalism sim set inside a funky lo-fi open world. You’ll be running about, snapping pics of chain-smoking crabs, tagging graffiti spots around the city, and just generally having a super chill time, yo. Developer Terri Vellman and music producer Doseone are back behind the scenes, and if you want a taste of the slime (ew), Sludge Life 1 is free to keep until March 31st. On Steam, that is.

                              <span>To celebrate Deep Rock Galactic’s fifth anniversary, developer Ghost Ship took us back in time to the mystical land of 2018 and let us play Deep Rock Galactic Legacy, a version of the co-op shooter as it was back in 2018, before all of the updates. It was a fun, nostalgic way to let fans reminisce on the game’s infantile days. Ghost Ship had planned to remove Legacy today - March 23rd - but after fan feedback, they’ve decided to keep Legacy edition around indefinitely.

Maybe not to the battery-sipping, framerate-abundant extent of the very best Steam Deck games, but with the right settings, nu-Resi 4 can keep its burlap sacked head well above 30fps even in its most visually demanding scenes.

Still, twelve maulings, three beheadings, and one chainsaw disembowelment later, I’ve got enough of a handle on Leon S. Kennedy’s disappointing Spanish holiday to help you get the most out of the new model’s PC performance. Including a guide to its best settings, which can especially help on lower-end rigs.

                              <span>This year&#x27;s Game Developers Choice and IGF Award ceremonies were really heartening stuff. Getting to see so many great developers have their games celebrated by their peers will always warm the old cockles, especially when we celebrated so many of them in our own RPS Advent Calendar at the end of last year. Well, I say &#x27;see&#x27;. In truth, I was tucked away backstage at this year&#x27;s IGF and GDC Awards, clutching my dictaphone with a single question in mind: if each winner had to give away their award to another game in their category, who would it be and why?   
It&#x27;s an idea Brendan (RPS in peace) came up with back in the primordial mists of 2018, and it was so good I just had to knick it and do it again. It might be cruel to wrench these awards away so soon after receiving them, but it&#x27;s all in the name of spreading good vibes and extra shoutouts, I promise. So here are the games of the year 2022, according to the people who just won awards for games of the year 2022.

                              <span>It&#x27;s day one of PAX East and what better way to kick off our show coverage than highlighting a great indie game! We first came across Demonschool back at PAX West last year and have loved it ever since. It&#x27;s a slick, tactical Persona-like where you play as a band of university students navigating school life by day and beating up ghosties and ghoulies by night.
I had a chat with Demonschool&#x27;s Jenna Stoeber who talked me through what Demonschool is about, the game&#x27;s many horror inspirations, and what spooky shinanigans players can expect. If the giant skeleton lad in the game&#x27;s trailer and demo is anything to go by, we&#x27;re in for a treat. You can watch the full interview by watching the video below:

If you&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t yet, set your peepers on Demonschool&#x27;s slick trailer to see what demon hunter Faye and her gang of misfits are up against. There&#x27;s no concrete release date, but like Jenna said, Demonschool should be out sometime in 2023 with a playable demo available in May.
We&#x27;ve got plenty more interviews, demos, and highlights lined up for the rest of the week and you can find all our PAX East coverage by checking out our RPS@PAX tag.

                              <span>Men Of War 2 doesn&#x27;t do anything by half measures, as I discovered during a recent tussle with its online multiplayer modes. Whereas Relic&#x27;s recently released Company Of Heroes 3 will let you pick from its four broad faction types in its WWII RTS battles, Men Of War 2 takes a much more granular view, offering up 14-15 different unit types for each of its three playable nations. That&#x27;s a dizzying array of infantry, tank and artillery battalions to choose from, and that&#x27;s before you account for all the individual nuances between its Soviet, USA and German army types. Throw in seven game modes across several different maps, and it&#x27;s a veritable strategy smorgasbord to stuff your face into. 
Crucially, though, everyone gets access to some sort of tank, which let&#x27;s face it, is always going to be the MVP of any WW2 strategy game, and probably the sole reason why we&#x27;re here in the first place. As Men Of War 2 heads into its first open multiplayer tech test on Steam today (running until March 27th), here&#x27;s my full report of my mildly doomed multiplayer tankventures in its Combat, Front Line and Incursion modes.

                              <span>One of Sea of Star’s most compelling selling points is the involvement of Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.
The majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I&#x27;ve been a drummer since I was a kid and I&#x27;m still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…</span>

Today, Ash&#x27;s journey came to an end in Japan (the dubbed version is coming at a later date) and the English voice actor for him, Sarah Natochenny, released a statement congratulating Ash&#x27;s Japanese voice actor, Rica Matsumoto, and thanking her for 17 years of inspiration.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s remake of Resident Evil 4 is finally out and to celebrate the day, the company has released a special launch trailer teasing what to expect in the game. This launch trailer also features some exciting news for fans of the original game. That&#x27;s because at the end of it, the trailer cuts to a screen revealing that The Mercenaries, a mode from the original 2005 release, will be released as free DLC next month. 
More specifically, The Mercenaries will hit Resident Evil 4 on April 7. If it&#x27;s like the original game&#x27;s mode, you&#x27;ll need to complete the story of Resident Evil 4 remake before unlocking The Mercenaries. In this mode, you select a Resident Evil 4 character and attempt to kill as many enemies as possible in a given time limit. There&#x27;s rankings associated with how well you do, weapons to unlock and more.

                              <span>A bill designed to crack down on pirate IPTV services has been unanimously approved by Italy&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies. If passed by the Senate, telecoms regulator AGCOM, broadcasters, and anti-piracy affiliates are poised and ready to go. Pirate streams will be blocked within minutes, maybe even seconds, according to reports. Stream suppliers will face three years in prison and for those who watch them, 5,000 euro fines will be on the table.

                              <span>Tým okolo certifikační autority Let’s Encrypt spustil rozhraní ARI: ACME Renewal Information. Pomocí něj je možné klientům ACME signalizovat, kdy mají požádat o obnovu certifikátů. Za normálních okolností mají certifikáty platnost 90 dnů a ARI tak může signalizovat potřebu obnovení po 60 dnech. Pokud by ale Let&#x27;s Encrypt potřeboval z nějakého důvodu certifikáty obnovit dříve, může o tom klienty informovat právě pomocí ARI.</span>

The developer took action after the Motion Picture Association targeted the open-source Android app in a complaint filed at GitHub. The MPA hasn&#x27;t contacted the developer directly but the Hollywood group considers Cloudstream a prime enforcement target.

                              <span>A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon&#x27;s interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it&#x27;s planned for later this year. Alongside today&#x27;s news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol.&quot; 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

                              <span>Arkane Studios, best known for creating the acclaimed stealth series Dishonored, has made a name for itself by realizing game worlds with rich lore, environmental storytelling, and curious, interweaving levels. Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

                              <span>Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection&#x27;s initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails&#x27; Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don&#x27;t already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The Nier: Automata tracks &quot;Dependent Weakling,&quot; &quot;Weight of the World Kowaretasekainouta – Marina Kawano,&quot; &quot;Amusement Park,&quot; &quot;A Beautiful Song,&quot; And &quot;Emil&#x27;s Shop,&quot; will be added to the game on March 29.

The wait is NieRly over!
@NieRGame Series pack for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line will launch on March 29th with the following songs:

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Your Ocean,&quot; &quot;World is Yours,&quot; &quot;Breaking Free,&quot; &quot;Twister,&quot; and &quot;Calling.&quot; Song packs typically cost $3 to $6 depending on the pack, but you&#x27;ll get all of these NEO songs and all of these Nier songs if you&#x27;ve purchased Season Pass 1. 
We love the game, and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Theatrhythm Final Bar Line review.

                              <span>During Summer Game Fest last June, Alien fans were treated to the reveal of a new title called Aliens: Dark Descent. The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn&#x27;t seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The Lego Group and 2K have revealed Lego 2K Drive, a new open-world racing game launching this May. 
More specifically, Lego 2K Drive hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 19. The game is being developed by WWE 2K and NBA 2K studio, Visual Concepts, and is reminiscent of Forza Horizon&#x27;s open-world exploration mixed with Mario Kart-like racing. If you&#x27;re wondering how we know that, it&#x27;s because we went hands-on with it for a few hours recently, and you can read our preview of the game right now. 
Check out the game in action below: 


Lego 2K Drive is the first collaboration between the Lego Group and 2K but not the last because it is the start of &quot;a multi-title partnership between 2K and the Lego Group to develop AAA Lego games.&quot;

                              <span>Atari has announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Night Dive Studios, the team behind the upcoming remake of System Shock, for roughly $10 million. 
Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it&#x27;s easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it. 


&quot;In addition, Atari, SA also announced that it intends to proceed in the near-term with a €30 million bond issue co…</span>

                              <span>Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, &quot;We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, &#x27;No PlayStation 5. Now we&#x27;re gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.&#x27;&quot;


Smith said Arkane didn&#x27;t mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
&quot;Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,&quot; Smith told IGN France. &quot;And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.&quot; 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it&#x27;s par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it&#x27;s also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2.

                              <span>Long before Final Fantasy 14 swept over the MMO landscape, there was 2002&#x27;s Final Fantasy 11 Online. I wasn’t really away that Final Fantasy 11 was still running, but the MMO has been chugging along quietly for a few years - its last expansion having arrived in 2013. After 20 years of support, however, Square Enix is putting Final Fantasy 11 in maintenance mode, meaning servers will stay up and it’ll remain playable, but with limited support.

There’s much more in the version 1.09 update besides – the patch notes list plenty of balance changes and bug fixes – but given the sheer amount of time the new ray tracing features have been in the works, not to mention the fact that Elden Ring has never exactly been an exemplar of technical reliability, I wanted to focus in on &#x27;em and see what performance is like on PC.

We kind of end up on an &quot;who tf knows?&quot; but do manage to boil it down into a cowboy metaphor that helps us get a grip on things.
We talk about all that stuff for so long that we end up overrunning and don&#x27;t have time for A Good Day To Ware Hard, or Nate&#x27;s Tower Of Jocularity - although he promises a titanic one next week. We do get in our what games we&#x27;ve been playing this week, and it&#x27;s a varied selection.

The game features co-op, multiplayer modes, and the ability to transform between air and land vehicles, Team Sonic Racing-style. The downside? Its collection of pre-order bonuses probably needs a graph of some kind to understand.

                              <span>Something terrible lurks beneath the waves in Dredge. Actually, scratch that. There are a lot of terrible things that call the oceans of The Marrows home in this melancholy fishing adventure, but what they are, I couldn&#x27;t possibly tell you. In all my hours sailing these cursed waters, I&#x27;ve only ever seen brief flashes of them - their ungodly, slippery masses, long spiny fins, and a dozen different combinations of glowing eyes, teeth and tentacles. They&#x27;re forever fading in and out of view, cloaked by the thick fog that blankets the sea every evening. Sometimes your ship lights will catch them for a split second before they slip away, or maybe you&#x27;ll only hear them hurtling toward you, with a scream of a jet engine and a maw that&#x27;s white hot, ready for gnashing your flimsy wooden carcass into sawdust. 
It&#x27;s unnerving, being out at sea after dark, but that&#x27;s the time when the rarest and most vile catches raise their scaly heads. So the question becomes: are you willing to risk your own sanity for the sake of a quick buck? Or are you too afraid of what you&#x27;ll find in Davy Jones&#x27; locker? In Dredge, the answer is always yes.

As part of the company’s State Of Unreal presentation, Epic unveiled Unreal Editor For Fortnite (UEFN), a UE5-powered version of the game’s Creative mode which the community has been referring to as Creative 2.0 for the past few months.

                              <span>Last fall, a court of appeals in the Netherlands ruled that internet provider Ziggo is not required to forward piracy warnings to its subscribers. The ruling was a setback for local anti-piracy group BREIN, which wanted to warn frequent uploaders without knowing who they are. BREIN now says that it won&#x27;t take the dispute to the Supreme Court, which might actually be bad news for pirates.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game&#x27;s darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game&#x27;s grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it&#x27;s a trailer released as part of today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation, it&#x27;s less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it&#x27;s due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review after that.

                              <span>Ninja Theory revealed Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II during The Game Awards back in 2019 and while that initial trailer impressed us with its dark tone and beautiful visuals, not much else has been released about the game. Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what&#x27;s to come in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it&#x27;s a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll be playing the game, though.

                              <span>Valve has revealed Counter-Strike 2 and it will be released this summer. 
An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will &quot;be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release.&quot; 
The company also says, &quot;Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike&#x27;s history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come.&quot;
Alongside today&#x27;s reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features &quot;available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate.&quot; There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player&#x27;s CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

                              <span>A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts &quot;a master storyteller.&quot; The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

We still have no release window for the project, and given that they&#x27;ve only just attached a writer, it&#x27;s probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie&#x27;s existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

                              <span>Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season&#x27;s pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings &quot;Blocky&quot; skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you&#x27;ve played 2021&#x27;s Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer&#x27;s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

                              <span>Cal Kestis’ desperate fight against the Empire is the centerpiece of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and a new story trailer provides a peek into his struggle as well as the allies, old and new, helping him. 
The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years&#x27; worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.</span>

Now that we&#x27;re three months into the calendar, Sonic Team is ready to release the first of the three updates this week. 
This first content release of 2023 is called &quot;Sights, Sounds, and Speed&quot; and adds content across three areas of the game. First up, new challenge modes, which can be accessed after you complete the main story campaign, give you access to Cyber Space Challenge and Battle Rush via the title screen. Cyber Space Challenge is a time-attack mode where you play through several of the game&#x27;s linear Cyber Space stages in rapid succession with the goal of scoring the best time.

Starting with the least surprising statistic, players have attempted to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella, a colossal 329 million times. In second place, players have attempted to beat Margit the Fell Omen 281 million times. In third, Limgrave Tree Sentinel 277 million times, Radagon of the Golden Order in fourth at 148 million, and in fifth, Starscourge Radahn at 139 million. Across all bosses in Elden Ring, players have initiated 5.9 billion attempts. 
If you enjoyed those stats, there are all kinds of other ones in the infographic below – enjoy!

Another day, another horrifyingly cute and disturbing Resident Evil 4 anime short to watch. Earlier this week, Capcom released Episode 1 of its &quot;Resident Evil 4 Anime – Leon and the Mysterious Village,&quot; following it up yesterday with the release of Episode 2. Episode 3 is now available for viewing and it&#x27;s the most gruesome yet (but also, still very cute). 
Enjoy!


The original story continues below...
Update, 3/22/24: 
Earlier this week, Capcom released a cute (and disturbing) anime short based on Resident Evil 4 and now, just a couple of days later, the company has released another one. The first saw Leon attempting his way through the Village section of Resident Evil 4 but this time, we see him try to rescue Ashley Graham from El Gigante...and it doesn&#x27;t go well.

More specifically, Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on April 13. You can access this Early Access launch via both Steam and the Epic Games Store. In Trinity Fusion, you play as Maya, a cross-dimensional warrior who is able to tap into three versions of herself across parallel dimensions. 
Check out the action all three versions of Maya must face in the multiverse in the new Trinity Fusion trailer below: 


&quot;We have a ton of content in the works for Trinity Fusion,&quot; Angry Mob Games&#x27; Bogdan Iliesiu writes in a press release. &quot;Given the amazing feedback we received from players throughout Steam Next Fest and events like EGX, releasing in Early Access was an easy decision to make. With the Early Access release, we&#x27;ll be able to get that same great feedback on our new biomes, enemies, and bosses on an ongoing basis as we keep adding more for players to explore and fight through.&quot; 
Trinity Fusion hits Early Access on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on April 13.

                              <span>Zack Snyder, the director behind &quot;Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,&quot; &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; and more, has revealed that his upcoming Netflix movie, &quot;Rebel Moon,&quot; is getting the game treatment. 
Snyder told The Nerd Queens podcast this alongside word that he was helping with the development of the game, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for the type of game, Snyder says it will be an RPG and apparently, it will have a &quot;ridiculous scale.&quot; 
&quot;The one thing that I&#x27;m having a really good time with – and I don&#x27;t really know if I&#x27;m supposed to talk about it – is this RPG that we&#x27;re doing that is just literally insane, and so immersive and so intense and so huge,&quot; he said on the podcast, according to VGC. &quot;There&#x27;s more coming, but all I&#x27;ll say is that it was pitched to me – because I&#x27;ve always wanted to do an RPG – like, &#x27;well, we could do it at this scale, or we could do it at ridiculous scale.&#x27;
&quot;And I was like, &#x27;ridiculous scale is clearly the scale that we should be doing it.&#x27;&quot;
Snyder says the team behind the RPG said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s going to take so much time, we&#x27;ve got to do all these brain dumps, you&#x27;ve got to tell us everything in the universe, what&#x27;s happening, the science.&quot; And Snyder said he was happy to do that, telling them, &quot;Let&#x27;s go all the way.&quot; 
Snyder wrote and directed Rebel Moon and it hits Netflix this December. 
In the meantime, read about how Netflix is developing its own series based on video games, like this live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed show and this animated Gears of Wars series (alongside a live-action Gears of War film, too).

                              <span>Editor&#x27;s Note: This article was updated on March 20 to include statements from Bungie, Guerrilla, and Lance Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick. 
Lance Reddick, perhaps best known for his role in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; has died. He was 60 years old. 
At the time of this writing, the cause of death is unknown but according to TMZ, &quot;law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.&quot; Deadline was also able to confirm, through the actor&#x27;s public relations representative, that Reddick has died.
Beyond &quot;The Wire,&quot; Reddick also had roles in other shows like &quot;Fringe,&quot; &quot;Lost,&quot; &quot;Bosch,&quot; and even last year&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series on Netflix. His movie credits include the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise (he was promoting the latest, &quot;John Wick 4,&quot; which hits theaters soon, just this week), &quot;Godzilla Vs. Kong,&quot; and more. 
On the video game side of things, you might recognize him as the voice actor behind Destiny 2&#x27;s Zavala. He also provided his voice and likeness to Sylens in PlayStation&#x27;s Horizon series and Martin Hatch in Remedy&#x27;s Quantum Break. 
Below are statements from Destiny 2 developer Bungie, Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerrilla, and Reddick&#x27;s wife, Stephanie Reddick:

                              <span>The first two installments of Syberia are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The acclaimed series from Benoît Sokal follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York as she initially tries to complete the sale of the Voralberg toy factory. But quickly Kate is drawn into a search for the owner which takes her on a journey of discovery.  Join her as she uncovers the owner’s fascination with mammoths, the secrets of Syberia, and a love for adventure.
