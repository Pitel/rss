Yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini in Japan included some extra Switch announcements, and in case you missed it, one of them was Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher.

Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can spend their extra Platinum Points on player icons, and this week, Nintendo added new avatars based on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Now we&#x27;re talking! Since I last spoke about these wave-based profile pics, I&#x27;ve mostly tuned them out — but today is a big exception. Among other options, it&#x27;s possible to set your Switch icon as the revolting (and amusingly censored) Dubious Food.
Link, Zelda, Urbosa, Revali, Tera, and a riled-up Bokoblin — the gang&#x27;s all here. If you want to be prim and proper, the choice is yours. My eyes immediately darted elsewhere.
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_332306&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;1920&quot;] Zelda: Breath of the Wild player icons are up for grabs until July 4 at 5:59 p.m. Pacific.[/caption]
If you&#x27;re feeling bold, you&#x27;ll drop 10 points on the Dubious Food and swap it in as your (permanent?) new Nintendo Switch player icon. Well, at least until the joke wears thin.
You can find the current selection from your Switch home screen — click on the red Switch Online icon, then scroll down to Missions &amp; Rewards to see what&#x27;s available.
This whole &quot;weekly avatars&quot; scheme is still pretty fresh, with tons of games and imagery to pull from, so I think it&#x27;s amusing that Nintendo is willing to include some off-kilter imagery this early into the proceedings. If anything, the trick is just getting people to pay attention — I would&#x27;ve totally missed the Dubious Food if not for a Reddit shout-out.
After appearing in Breath of the Wild and Age of Calamity, I&#x27;ll be bummed if this so-called food doesn&#x27;t return for the sequel. I hope it&#x27;s even more of a wildcard next time around.

                              <span>Favorites from Spy X Family, Kaiju No. 8, and more guest in this tactics game
There were a bunch of third-party games shown in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini Partner Showcase, but one in particular threw me at first glance. Captain Velvet Meteor: The Jump+ Dimensions is an upcoming tactical RPG that leans into guests from the Shonen Jump+ catalog.
The new tactics game from Momo-Pi Game Studio and Shueisha Games follows Damien, a boy who&#x27;s just moved to Japan. Feeling lonely in his new home, he dives into his imagination as the superhero Captain Velvet Meteor.
Along the way, he imagines a roster of his favorite Jump+ characters filling his adventures. It&#x27;s an interesting premise, emphasized by the presence of actual famous faces from the Shonen Jump+ lineup.

                              <span>Despite some growing pains, it&#x27;s a good time to fall off inflatables
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is free-to-play now, for close to a week. Over the last weekend, I spent hours getting back in; acclimating to the new model, browsing the new rewards, and marveling at all that&#x27;s changed since I dropped off. And despite some early wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really deny it. It&#x27;s a good time to be back into Fall Guys.
It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to divorce Fall Guys from the moment when it launched. It was the first summer of the pandemic, and with everyone inside and socially distanced, Fall Guys was a welcome reprieve. Much like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, it became a forum for social interaction. But that&#x27;s not to say Fall Guys wasn&#x27;t good on its own merits, either.

                              <span>The Mighty Thor, Jane Foster’s godly alter ego, swoops into Marvel’s Avengers today. Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.
Jane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. 
The Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.




Jane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity. You can catch up on the roster by checking out our list of every playable hero in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers.</span>

                              <span>Harvestella is Square Enix’s new RPG meets farming sim announced during today’s Nintendo Direct Mini. 
The game takes place in a world where the four seasons are dictated by four giant crystals called Seaslight. But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.
Harvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. 


When you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. 
Harvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>With Gotham Knights exploring what life is like in a post-Bruce Wayne world, his iconic sidekick is wondering what a Robin is without a Batman. Apparently, he&#x27;s unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.


In a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham&#x27;s thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He&#x27;s also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.
Gotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.</span>

                              <span>Over the last 31 years, the Sonic the Hedgehog fan base has dashed through several distinct eras. The Classic Era let fans platform through brilliantly designed 2D stages, while the Modern Era gave us the Adventure games and Boost games, and that&#x27;s not even counting the Sonic Boom titles. Now, with the movies setting box office records and reinserting everyone&#x27;s favorite blue hedgehog back into the mainstream consciousness, a new era for Sonic the Hedgehog games could very well be upon us. With Sonic Frontiers, Sega and Sonic Team could hope to welcome fans to the Open-Zone Era of the franchise.
For this issue&#x27;s cover story, I traveled to Burbank, California to Sonic Team&#x27;s U.S. headquarters to play hours of Sonic Frontiers. I spent that time exploring Kronos Island, fighting enemies, solv…</span>

                              <span>Sonic Frontiers’ “open zone” format has been the centerpiece of discussion, and for a good reason. Dropping Sonic in an open-world style environment gives fans a new, bigger arena to roam around and go fast in. However, traditionalists may be happy to learn that Frontiers includes standard, linear platforming stages hidden in unlockable areas called Cyber Space. I got to play one of these stages during my demo during Summer Game Fest Play Days a couple of weeks ago to get a handle on how these self-contained levels compliment Frontiers&#x27; exploration-heavy gameplay. 
As seen during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, while exploring the open world (which you can read about in my previous preview), I collected special items called Portal Gears. You can obtain these gears by solving puzzles and comp…</span>

                              <span>After years of the fan base begging Atlus to bring its mainline Persona games to Switch, the publisher finally satisfies that request. Hot on the heels of the announcement of Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, Atlus announced during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini presentation that the three upgraded versions of its beloved Persona games will also arrive on Nintendo Switch.


Persona 5 Royal, the 2020 upgraded version of the 2017 base game, comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, Switch, and PC on October 21. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden are also coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, though they&#x27;ll do so later. 
Only Persona 5 Strikers, the spin-off/follow-up to Persona 5, and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, a fighting-game follow-up to Persona 4, have appeared on Switch platforms. For our review of Persona 5 Royal, head here. To learn more about Persona 5 Strikers, head here.</span>

                              <span>The previously announced Portal: Companion Collection gathers the two acclaimed first-person puzzle games into one bundle for Switch. While we already knew it was coming sometime this year, today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini presentation news revealed that we&#x27;ll be able to play two of the greatest puzzle games of all time on Switch beginning today.
Portal was released in 2007 as a part of The Orange Box, a bundle that gathered Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2. This standalone title added several new mechanics, extended playtime, a more involved story exploring the backstories of Aperture Science and GlaDOS, and a separate co-op multiplayer campaign.
Both Portal titles are considered among the greatest video games ever made and are available today on Nintendo Switch.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has pulled back the curtains on Dragon Quest Treasures, a new spin-off entry in the legendary Dragon Quest franchise that was first teased in May 2021. This game focuses on the childhoods of Mia and Erik, two siblings from Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age. As these two characters, players embark on hunts for treasure in Draconia before the events of Dragon Quest XI.


As Mia and Erik travel through Draconia, they can recruit monsters to locate loot, explore the world, and fight enemies. Your recruited monsters are more helpful than just battling, it turns out: Using Slimes, you can bounce up to higher ledges, while grabbing onto a Dracky while you&#x27;re exploring can allow you to glide like Breath of the Wild&#x27;s paraglider. Once you complete your treasure hunt and obtain your prize, you can bring it back to your base to see how much it&#x27;s worth. Using the funds you obtain from your hunts, you can improve your base and increase your treasure hunting level. 
Dragon Quest Treasures launches on December 9 for Switch.</span>

During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, we received an update on the exciting, beautiful HD2D title that remakes the 1994 Super Famicom RPG that never came to Western markets. However, the big news from the presentation is that if you want to see what the buzz is all about, you can get a taste starting today.
The game puts you in the roles of multiple stories and multiple protagonists across different eras. The demo that hits the eShop today allows you to play three chapters from three different eras to get an idea of what to expect. Not only that but the save data transfers to the full game if you decide to buy it; it&#x27;s always nice to know your time in a demo is productive when it comes to the final release.
Live A Live comes to Switch on July 22.</span>

The result was a turn-based tactical title starring the Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s finest and the most unpredictable characters in Ubisoft&#x27;s stable. Announced during Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2021 Direct, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope promises to carry forward the legacy of that fan-favorite title, but it&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve heard anything about that game. That changed today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which shined the spotlight on the company&#x27;s third-party partners.

                              <span>Bandai Namco has announced a new remake of Pac-Man World called Pac-Man World: Re-Pac. This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.


Pac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world&#x27;s final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.
This is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier&#x27;s classic catalog.
Pac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>When the first Mega Man Legacy Collection launched in 2015, players hoped there was more to follow. Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.


Today, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it&#x27;s been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:
Mega Man Battle Network
Mega Man Battle Network 2
Mega Man Battle Network 3 White
Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun
Mega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman
Mega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar
Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.</span>

                              <span>Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.


In the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.
When the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I&#x27;m hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>One of the most requested titles is finally coming to Switch later this year. Nier: Automata quickly found a large fan base when it launched in 2017, with many praising the storytelling, action, and soundtrack of the Platinum Games-developed title. Now, more than five years later, the heartfelt story of 2B and 9S comes to Nintendo Switch.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition includes previously released content and new costumes that will be available at launch. We don&#x27;t know much else about what appears to be an &quot;ultimate&quot; or &quot;game of the year&quot; edition of the title, but the game&#x27;s inclusion in the Switch library is noteworthy. When Nier: Automata launched in 2017, it received critical and fan acclaim, with the PlayStation 4 version garnering an 88 out of 100 score on reviews aggregate website Metacritic.
Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition arrives on Nintendo Switch on October 6. For one Game Informer&#x27;s opinion on why you need to play Nier: Automata in some form, head here.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo kicked off its Direct Mini presentation today with a new trailer for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle. However, Capcom isn&#x27;t stopping there, as the new trailer gave way to a roadmap of free title updates for players over the next several months.


The first title update hits in August, adding Seething Bazelgeuse, Lucent Nargacuga, and several other monsters. That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters. Finally, Capcom says a fourth free title update will arrive in 2023, but it isn&#x27;t ready to say anything about what to expect with that one.
Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available June 30 on Switch and PC. For more on the base game, check out our review from 2021 when it first hit Switch. For more on the Sunbreak expansion, get caught up on every monster confirmed right here.</span>

                              <span>Last year, the team behind Fallout: London, a “DLC-sized mod” for Bethesda’s Fallout 4, released a reveal trailer that showcased what to expect across the pond in the world of Fallout, and it looked great. Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. 
And speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. 
Here’s some more information about the mod straight from the team:

Murder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent&#x27;s deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…</span>

                              <span>Adata&#x27;s Premium SSD for PS5 might be the most misleadingly titled storage device on the market. Okay, it is a high-spec SSD suitable for the PS5, but it&#x27;s also a really good value PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs too. Today, it&#x27;s down to $185 at Adata&#x27;s official Ebay store when you use the code FREEDOM15 - an unbelievable price for the level of performance on offer. 
That&#x27;s some $145 below MSRP and way cheaper than similarly-specced 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the Samsung 980 Pro ($260) or Crucial P5 Plus ($244).

                              <span>I think of Disney as a company that will protect their image by working on something until it&#x27;s both good and finished, which is frankly stupid of me given I just finished watching Obi-Wan Kenobi. Still, I found myself surprised when I learned that Disney Dreamlight Valley will be an early access game when it launches on September 6th. Watch the latest trailer for the Disney-themed Animal Crossing &#x27;em up below.

Its name also does most of my job for me: this is a game about constructing islands, right? And then you build trains on them, yeah? It&#x27;s &quot;coming soon&quot; and it looks delightful in GIFs the developer has been posting on Twitter.

It&#x27;s a mystery game, a puzzle game, set in a baroque manor and - as per everything they make - dripping with style. Check out the announcement trailer below.

                              <span>I thought Sonic Frontiers was less Breath Of The Wild and more Super Mario Odyssey after I&#x27;d given it whirl in LA at Summer Geoff Fest. Despite its rough edges, Frontier&#x27;s open-ish world was a joy to blitz around as a hedgehog renowned for going particularly fast. But there was one thing I couldn&#x27;t talk about – Cyberspace stages: Bite-sized levels à la classic Sonic. And here&#x27;s why it might&#x27;ve been one of the best bits of the demo.

I demand they dig a new hole for the monthly RPS Time Capsule of games we&#x27;d like to save from a certain year, and usually it isn&#x27;t a problem. This time, however, the staff complained a lot about the year choice: it&#x27;s 2005, baby, and they struggled. I&#x27;m okay with it though, because we ended up with a lot of cool abandonware and interesting choices I couldn&#x27;t have predicted. Especially because, since I got to the Time Capsule first, I got to stuff in the most obvious choice.

                              <span>Also in Steam Deck news, Valve’s Lawrence Yang – a designer who worked on the on the handheld PC – has weighed in on a widely shared mod that replaces the pre-installed SSD with a larger, faster model. His advice: don’t do it.


The mod, by Twitter user Belly Jelly, swaps out the dinky default M.2 2230 SSD for a slightly longer M.2 2242 drive. It seems to mostly work fine except for making “the heat spreader bow a bit.” It was subsequently shared by PC Gamer, GameSpot and others before Yang tweeted a warning that such a change would “significantly shorten the life of your Deck” by moving thermal pads vital to cooling the charger IC (integrated circuit).

There are a lot of video games out there in the world. Shooters, platformers, narrative adventures, fighting games — iconic genres that have almost forty years of precedence to make them what they are today. Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there&#x27;s anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design. The industry has plenty of answers for keeping things moving forward, but my absolute favorite trend in games right now is genre mashup.
That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s as simple as taking two game genres and combining them…</span>

Ever since Capcom released Street Fighter II 30 years ago, the fighting game genre has attempted to strive for perfection. Oh sure, the methods, modes, mechanics, and artistic styles for every ring-rocker are very different, but every one of these games is pushing toward the same goal: the capture of a community; a passionate player base that will keep said fighter alive, kicking, and perpetually on its feet, lest it falls to a 10-count like so many contenders that have come before.
Today, it is incredibly rare that a developer makes a &quot;bad fighter.&quot; Whether billion-dollar franchises such as Tekken, Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighter itself, to mid-size slugfests such as The King of Fighters, Guilty Gear, and Skullgirls, to cultish outliers such as Melty Blood, Samurai Shodown…</span>

                              <span>Avast ye, the first trailer for Return to Monkey Island is finally here!
The Monkey Island games are heralded as some of the best point-and-click games ever made, so fans are pretty thrilled to be getting another mainline game twelve years after the series&#x27; last release, which was a special edition of the first two games. Another sequel is long overdue, and thankfully the developers behind the project, Terrible Toybox, just released a new trailer to satiate us as we wait for the game to drop later this year. The trailer was also posted by Monkey Island&#x27;s beloved designer and creator Ron Gilbert, who shared the news with the exact type of humor we&#x27;d expect from him.
The new trailer shows off Return to Monkey Island&#x27;s revamped art style, which captures the quirkiness of the characters and world perfectly. Although we didn&#x27;t get to see all that much of it, the gameplay itself looks like the classic Monkey Island experience we know and love. Story-wise, our plucky protagonist Guybrush Threepwood promises we&#x27;re in for an adventure with &quot;ships, fights, love, treasure, betrayal, and root beer.&quot; As an avid lover of all things pirate-related myself, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much more I could really ask for.

I can be pretty hesitant about sequels this far out from the originals, especially when a series&#x27; legacy is on the line, but I have to say that I&#x27;ve been blown away by everything I&#x27;ve seen of Return to Monkey Island so far. It also says a lot that they have some of the original creators involved. At this point, I&#x27;m optimistic that the game will bring a thrilling adventure from a classic series to a brand new audience.
Return to Monkey Island takes to the high seas sometime in 2022 for PC and Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>It doesn&#x27;t even have the French Goth one
When esoteric publisher Microids announced that we were getting five Smurfs games in as many years, we all laughed, then we cried a little, then laughed more to alleviate the pain. But it seems that we all had a lot of growing up to do, as Microids has channeled that bemusement into sadistic determination.
Following up the fall 2021 release of platform adventure The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf, the French publisher has now moved on to that second video game genre detailed in the Big Book of IP Licensing: Kart Racing. Smurfs Kart will see the little blue buggers taking to the rural raceway in a selection of rickety-looking wooden karts, loaded for bear with special items and unique abilities.
Players can choose from The Main One, The One With The Chef&#x27;s Hat, The Old One, Smurfette, or The Others. (Kinda &#x27;sus that I only know Smurfette by name, frankly), before hitting a series of woodland tracks in what is sure to be the bog-standard Mario Kart template that has been previously adopted by The Simpsons, Wacky Races, Garfield, Family Guy, Shrek, Angry Birds, LEGO, Nicktoons, Hello Kitty, Woody Woodpecker, Danger Mouse, and fucking M&amp;Ms.
Honestly, once Sonic and Sega All-Star Racing Transformed was released, we already had a grandstand champion. Still, now we&#x27;ve done platformer and kart racing, we have no choice but to go to the obligatory next stage: Smurfs Wrestling.
Smurfs Kart is currently in development for Nintendo Switch. It is expected to launch this winter.

Sonic Frontiers is an open-world game, but it also has more traditional 3D Sonic levels, and thanks to a gradual info rollout, we&#x27;re only now getting to see them up close. While Sega only showed a few seconds of these Cyber Space levels at today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, for some fans, it&#x27;s a sign of life — a glimmer of hope for this rocky-looking game.

Today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini video introduces the main setting of Sonic Frontiers, the Starfall Islands, and shows off the Cyber Space levels starting at the 0:45 mark.
By doing open-world stuff — solving puzzles, completing challenges, and the like — Sonic will earn Portal Gears that open up entrances to the Cyber Space levels. Sega is no stranger to leaning on …</span>

                              <span>Catch Some Rays
There&#x27;s another reason for shmup fans to get their trigger fingers in gear today, as the legendary arcade developer Taito and ShotTrigger makers M2 have announced a brand new compilation, Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology, which will compile the button-pounding titles of the cult shmup series, &quot;Ray.&quot;
Currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Ray&#x27;z Arcade Chronology will contain four classic Ray releases. Featured in the compilation are the original RayForce (1994), sequels RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998), as well as a revamped version of 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features. The chronology will be rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis — titled RayCrisis HD — so fans will be able to enjoy a brand new take on the franchise along with the aforementioned hits.

Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the info ends, with nary a release date or trailer to be seen, (though Taito Japan has opened a brand new website for the collection).
M2 have been done fantastic work in ensuring that the history of the shmup genre has been collated, archived and/or rereleased for modern audiences, and this upcoming collection will only add to the burgeoning catalog of coin-op classics.
Taito is yet to announce a western localization for the compilation, but we&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information is forthcoming.
Ray&#x27;Z Arcade Chronology is in development for PS4 and Switch, with a launch window of 2023.

                              <span>Handheld PC power is headed your way soon
Following up on its recent promise to increase the production and distribution of its Steam Deck hardware, developer Valve has announced that it is on track to double the number of consoles currently headed to its eagerly-waiting army of pre-order customers.
Speaking on Twitter, Valve noted that customers in the &quot;Q2&quot; reservation bracket should have already received their confirmation email, with Q3 confirmation emails expected to arrive in the coming fortnight. Customers should think fast, however, as they only have three days to confirm and pay for their chosen model, which will lock in their order and see their lil&#x27; black box begin the journey to their front door. Those still waiting on their email can check the status of their order at the Steam Deck store.
Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck has proven to be yet another victim of electronic component shortages. Ever since the global COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted international production and shipment industries, manufacturers have struggled to meet their initial targets for hardware rollout. The delays that currently affect the Steam Deck platform have also affected the production and distribution of consoles such as Sony&#x27;s PS5, Xbox&#x27;s Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, as well as graphics cards for PCs and tech markets outside of the gaming sphere.
The Steam Deck officially launched in March 2022, and currently supports well over 2000 titles.

                              <span>A new view of the post-apocalypse is on the way
Fallout London, a massive &quot;DLC-sized&quot; mod for Fallout 4, has a new trailer and a release window. The huge fan-made expansion is set to arrive next year, in 2023.
The trailer, which premiered over the weekend, showcases the sights and sounds of London in the post-nuclear apocalypse of Fallout. Though there&#x27;s ruins and destruction abound, you can still make out plenty of landmarks and vistas you&#x27;d expect to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zzGG-eImQ_Q
Fallout London is billed as a continuation of base Fallout 4. The setting is a pretty drastic jump as Fallout has never really ventured outside the U.S. for its locales. The team says tackling the London setting allows them to explore cultures that have not homogenized with the American wasteland, as well as explore the effects of the Resource Wars on pre-war Britain.
A new wasteland
We&#x27;ve seen some gameplay of this massive mod before, but it looks like the dev team has at least a decent inkling of when Fallout London will see the light of day. And even though Fallout and other Bethesda RPGs have a history of massive mods, this one has some particularly intriguing elements.
The boat and canals look really interesting. The obvious London theming feels like a good, healthy departure and exciting environment to explore. And at one point, at the very end of the trailer, I swear I saw a battle elephant. An honest-to-goodness, Lord of the Rings-style war elephant. Seems like London gets wild in the nuclear future.
Since it seems like it will be a very, very long time before Bethesda ever circles back around to the Fallout franchise, Fallout London seems like a decent hope for those looking for a fresh take. The massive Fallout 4 mod is planned to arrive sometime in 2023.

Did you ever play Attack of the Friday Monsters! A Tokyo Tale? Released nearly a decade ago for Nintendo 3DS as part of Level-5&#x27;s Guild02 compilation, the game is a slice-of-life adventure about a young kid named Sohta who&#x27;s just moved to a small town where giant kaiju fight every Friday. Its developer, Millennium Kitchen, found inspiration for the title from its flagship franchise Boku no Natsuyasumi, a somewhat popular slice-of-life series that saw a string of releases in Japan throughout the aughts.
Despite it never getting an official localization, Boku no Natsuyasumi has developed a pretty niche following in North America. So much so that it was pretty big news among a small group of fans when Millennium Kitchen announced it was developing a spin-off featur…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix takes you to the Rune Factory
A new farming game is coming to town this fall. Square Enix&#x27;s Harvestella is the company&#x27;s take on the farming life sim RPG, arriving November 4 for PC (via Steam) and Nintendo Switch.
Shown today during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Harvestella is a new RPG from Square Enix that mixes farming, socializing, and RPG action into one big pot.
It immediately gives off some Rune Factory vibes, as it seems to have a similar mix of combat and farming. But it&#x27;s also got some interesting twists on the formula.

While there are four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—there&#x27;s also a season of death called Quietus. During this time, crops wither and lethal dust keeps the denizens of the world indoors.
Planning harvests will have to accommodate for this bizarre mystery, and it looks like a major drive will be figuring out why the Quietus is happening.
A bountiful harvest
Of course, there&#x27;s both crop harvesting and livestock raising. Harvestella has many of the familiar farming trappings. It also has combat and an overworld to explore, though, which is where the Rune Factory comparison starts to feel more apt.
The Square Enix blog dives into more detail, noting a job system that will let the player character specialize in certain combat forms. Be a Fighter and dive right into the fray. Or play a Mage, and launch magic from afar. The overworld has new characters to meet, dungeons to explore, and even a submarine.

More and more companies have been trying their hand at a farming life sim. (A Disney-themed one was even in this showcase, too.) What Square Enix has with Harvestella seems pretty darn interesting. A game with all the expected features like farming, fighting, and socializing plus some RPG goodness in the mysteries of the world? Sign me up.
Harvestella arrives for Nintendo Switch and PC on Nov. 4, 2022.

Well, there&#x27;s something for everyone today! Although it wasn&#x27;t a massive heavy-hitting first-party live-streamed Nintendo Direct with huge &quot;reaction-worthy&quot; reveals (it was a 26-minute Direct Mini that was dumped onto YouTube instantly), Nintendo did give us a good look at some upcoming games on Switch. It&#x27;s time for a good old-fashioned Nintendo Direct Mini recap.

A stone-cold classic of dystopian gaming is headed to Switch this year — as revealed during this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, Square Enix&#x27;s apocalyptic and dramatic action adventure NieR: Automata will bring its wistful storytelling and dark, indelible worlds to the Switch platform this fall.
NieR: Automata: The End of YorHa Edition will see the award-winning 2017 release faithfully recreated for the Switch platform, bundled alongside all previously released content including DLC expansions, additional modes, and a fully-stocked wardrobe of snazzy duds for automated heroes 2B, 9S, and, A2. In addition, the Switch port will feature its own range of console exclusive skins, so you can ensure 2B is rocking all of her fineries as she picks her way through our miserable, dilapidated planet.

Originally developed by PlatinumGames, Nier: Automata sees an Earth lying in devastation, with mankind locked in a brutal proxy war against a seemingly insurmountable army of alien-created machines. In response, humanity builds its own automated protection in the form of sentient androids, who do battle with the machines in a never-ending war of attrition for control of the planet. NieR: Automata tells the story of three such androids and their dramatic, emotive, and often heart-breaking existence as pawns in a galactic battle for world domination.
NieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store and include a pretty rad-looking shirt.

As part of this morning&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, it was announced that the iconic, smash-hit puzzle platformers Portal and Portal 2 are hitting the Switch platform in the form of Portal: Companion Collection. Even better news, the irreverent, brain-teasing title will land on the eShop today!
https://youtu.be/wMQASUA_1Do
Portal Companion Collection compiles 2007 hit Portal along with its 2011 follow-up — the two classics are freshly repackaged for their release on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console. Return to the terrifying Aperture Science Enrichment Center and utilize the power of physics, gravity, and portals to guide our hero out of her cell, out of the system, and out of the hazardous clutches of the scarily sentient overseer, GLaDOS.
Combining dark humor, genuine pathos, and some fantastic lateral thinking shenanigans, the Portal games became instant classics upon release and have only welcomed more disciples into their twisted coven in the ensuing 15 years. Already available on practically every platform under the sun, this new compilation of two of gaming&#x27;s finest and most beloved puzzlers will allow Switch players to set their heads fizzing and spinning whilst in bed, on a commute, or simply out and about. Just watch your step.
Portal: Companion Collection launches on the Nintendo eShop today for $19.99.

                              <span>Two volumes in 2013
Announced today via the Nintendo Direct Mini showcase, a Mega Man Battle Network Switch collection is on the way, and it&#x27;ll feature 10 games.
Originally released in 2001, Capcom&#x27;s tactical RPG spinoff hit the ground running, and eventually saw a number of sequels, including a few &quot;different version&quot; launches similar to how Pokemon handles things. A &quot;complete&quot; edition with everything sort of solves that problem in the modern era.
Nintendo says that there will actually be two volumes (Volume 1, and Volume 2, which are &quot;each sold separately&quot;) to contain all those games, and that the release is coming in 2023. The Mega Man Battle Network collection on Switch will also sport a gallery &quot;with over 1000 illustrations,&quot; and &quot;over 150 songs from across the series.&quot; Capcom has confirmed that the re-releases &quot;feature optional high-resolution filters that allow players to enjoy smoother, less pixelated visuals,&quot; and &quot;players can turn the filters off/on at any time if they would prefer to enjoy the original visuals of the Battle Network games.&quot;
You can find Volume 1 on the Nintendo Store here, and Volume 2 here. Of note, Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS do not seem to be part of this collection.
Mega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 1 game list:

                              <span>Persona 5 is coming to Switch this year on October 21, 2022
The Persona Switch dream is a reality.
Today during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which was aimed at third-party partner announcements, Nintendo showcased the release of Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal on Switch. The former two are slated as a nebulous &quot;coming soon&quot; release, while Persona 5 is fully dated for October 21, 2022.
This news directly follows the recent announcement of the trio for the PC, PS5, and Xbox platforms two weeks ago. And really, it&#x27;s not even something that needed to be leaked, rather than assumed! Nintendo isn&#x27;t shy about collaborating with Atlus, and given that they aren&#x27;t exclusive to any one platform, the company likely wants to see the trio out on as many platforms as possible: including one of the best-selling consoles of the modern era.
In any case, a Persona Switch announcement is great news. All of these games need to proliferate as far and wide as possible, and all of them have their own unique spins and cast members to differentiate themselves. I like all three of them for very different reasons, though Persona 5 has become the golden goose in recent years, and the favorite in many circles.

Look, there&#x27;s a lot of Robins out there. Here&#x27;s where some of you will cue the &quot;I grew up in the &#x27;60s when there was just one Robin!&quot; voice: but each Robin has had a chance to shine in various stories with strong writing at the helm. There&#x27;s more Robins even still that aren&#x27;t in Gotham Knights! And there will continue to be Robins until the end of time. Batman isn&#x27;t going anywhere, and neither are his wards. In the meantime, we have this Gotham Knights Robin trailer to watch. To be clear, it&#x27;s Tim Drake!
So to be clear, we have Dick Grayson&#x27;s Robin (who stars in Teen Titans Go, and eventually becomes Nightwing), Jason Todd&#x27;s Red Hood (who was Robin at one point in most Batman timelines), and Tim Drake: who is typically seen as the &quot;new younger Robin&quot; in the classic costum…</span>

                              <span>The 2022 Nintendo Direct Mini is at 9AM ET on June 28
Well, it&#x27;s happening! Sorta! It&#x27;s not the full Nintendo Direct that was predicted by some on June 29 — rather, it&#x27;s a Nintendo Direct Mini on June 28. That&#x27;s at 9AM ET, actually, and the publisher says it&#x27;ll be happening here when the time comes.
Again, it&#x27;s important to note that this isn&#x27;t a first-party Direct, and to set your expectations accordingly. Here is the full descriptive rundown of the Nintendo Direct Mini that we got directly from Nintendo:
&quot;Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on June 28 for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party Nintendo Switch games.&quot;

So on paper, we&#x27;re not getting updates on Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 or Metroid Prime 4...yet. Or an update on when Advance Wars might come out on Switch for that matter.
25 minutes is a fairly meaty timeframe, in any case, so we should see at least one big third-party announcement. I assume a lot of you will be doing avid amounts of research as to what a Nintendo Direct Mini actually entails, and we did a lot of the legwork already! You can check this out to get an idea of what a Direct Mini could look like.
The company was smart to move this away from the Summer of Gaming/to-E3-or-not-to-E3 week and have it be its own thing. Even if it doesn&#x27;t include first-party updates, all it takes is one megaton announcement (something exclusive akin to Shin Megami Tensei V) to make waves.

                              <span>October 20, 2022
The Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope release date was leaked...by Ubisoft itself! It seems as if the sequel is due in October, thanks to a listing for October 20 on an international arm of Ubisoft&#x27;s own site. The date was subsequently taken down, but it was discovered by several folks on Twitter (including Wario64) and screencapped/archived.
In all likelihood, Ubisoft and Nintendo want to save the Sparks of Hope release announcement for the Nintendo Direct Mini this morning, so we only have roughly an hour and change to go until we get full confirmation. Now, this has happened before. The announcement for the game itself was actually fully leaked by the Nintendo storefront around this time in 2021.
As a reminder, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was revealed last year, and serves as a sequel to the 2017 original, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Ubisoft promises more open-ended levels to tackle, as well as an enhanced combat system.
It feels like we&#x27;re in a weird little &quot;post-E3&quot; era this summer, with all these Nintendo announcements either leaking errantly or on the way. Hopefully we get some good third party confirmations for 2022! A lot seems to be delayed into 2023 across the industry.
[Update: The October 20, 2022 date was confirmed in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini showcase.]

It&#x27;s been long enough since I finished Elden Ring that I no longer remember many of the controls, which is a good place for me to be — it means I&#x27;ll be able to revisit the game with relatively fresh eyes sooner than later. After marathoning it, I&#x27;m excited to play again at a slower pace, and a recent discovery shared on Reddit has hyped me up even more.
For those of you who aren&#x27;t done with Elden Ring yet, let&#x27;s just say that a certain important late-game area can be spotted right from the beginning. It&#x27;s one of those things that&#x27;s easily overlooked even if you know what you&#x27;re looking for and have the full context.
There&#x27;s so much to take in at the First Step — it&#x27;s your first real chance to admire the scale of Elden Ring — and it&#x27;s easy to want to immediately head off…</span>

                              <span>Fame and Kudos are touchy subjects
Multiplayer platformer royale Fall Guys went free-to-play last week, with its first free season and a new model launching across new and old platforms. A lot of players have been dipping back in, or jumping on for the first time. But some Fall Guys fans, especially long-time players, seem frustrated with the changes made to its monetization model.
Prior to the free-to-play launch, Mediatonic&#x27;s competitive game-show-style platformer Fall Guys was a one-time buy game. With the move to free-to-play, the model has shifted from using Crowns (wins). Now Crowns just go towards a separate, smaller cosmetic track.
The price of Fame
One major area of frustration is with Fame, the currency used to progress in the seasonal pass. It&#x27;s similar to the battle pass model …</span>

Over the past 30 years, WayForward, makers of the Shantae series, has made a name for itself by crafting retro-flavoured gems that combine the best of modern gaming with an unashamedly old-school aesthetic and game feel. Whether it&#x27;s baked into their own projects (such as the Mighty series or the aforementioned Shantae games) or for one of the developer/publisher&#x27;s many excellent licensed property projects (DuckTales Remastered, Contra 4, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, The Mummy Demastered, River City Girls, to name just a small handful of highlights), the studio&#x27;s always got one eye on gaming&#x27;s illustrious past as it forges ahead into its fourth decade.
For its latest project, Spidersaurs, WayForward is looking not only to a titan of the run-and-gun genre for inspiration, but also to the energy and aesthetic of &#x27;90s Saturday morning cartoons. Formerly an Apple Arcade exclusive, the game is coming to Switch and other consoles on 14th July.

Towards the end of the trailer, we got a look at the roadmap planned for the game, with free title updates coming in August, Autumn, Winter, and 2023.

                              <span>Make friends in a great kingdom.
Popular manga character Doraemon got an unexpected crossover back in 2019 with the Story of Seasons franchise. This charming blue cat (yes, he is a robotic cat) made for a perfect fit with the chill farming vibes of Marvelous&#x27; well-known farming sim in Doraemon Story of Seasons, and because everyone fell utterly head-over-heels for it (they did, right?), we&#x27;re getting another dose of Doraemon.
Doraemon Story of Seasons: Friends of the Great Kingdom featured in today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini with more lovely manga-esque cutscenes and watercolour visuals. This time Doraemon and his friends crash land on a mysterious planet, and try to get on with things by starting up a farm, raising crops, fishing, and more. You&#x27;ll even get to sit at the table and — get this — eat with Doraemon!

Earlier this year, publisher Shueisha created its own subsidiary for video games, and at the same time announced a number of projects that they would be working on. One of those is the adorable tactical adventure game Captain Velvet Meteor: The Jump+ Dimensions which brings popular Jump+ characters into the tactical genre.
During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct Mini, we got a short look at the upcoming game, along with some story, some lovely comic-style visuals, and a little glance at the gameplay. The game follows Damien, a young French-Japanese boy who loves manga. One day, his parents tell him they&#x27;re moving from France back to Japan, and this makes the boy nervous. So, to deal with this, Damien takes on his superhero alter ego where he&#x27;ll join forces with manga heroes to fight enemies and deal with his anxieties.

We didn&#x27;t get too many shadow drops during today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct — Portal: Companion Collection launches today, and a Live A Live demo is also going to be available to download. But one surprise during the presentation was a brand new, pretty darn cute-looking roguelite called Little Noah: Scion of Paradise.
Developed by Cygames, the makers of Dragalia Lost, this pastel-coloured adventure sees you control Noah, an alchemist who crash-lands in some ancient ruins. While she&#x27;s trying to escape the ever-changing layouts of the ruins, she can recruit Lilliputs (monsters) to fight for her. And in true roguelite tradition, if you die, everything will be different on the way back. But you&#x27;ll be able to use items to make yourself stronger every time you re-enter the ruins.

The seizures were straightforward due to Verisign and GoDaddy being American companies. However, additional facts regarding these seizures, including on whose behalf they were supposedly carried out, raise key issues that don&#x27;t make much sense.

A proposal to repeal the applicable law was submitted in Parliament last year, but that ultimately failed.

                              <span>Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) is more of a niche prospect than its upscaler cousin DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), though it shares the same ultimate goal of making your PC games look sharper. Like DLSS, DLAA uses a dash of AI brainpower to stitch together frames with more detail than conventional anti-aliasing techniques like TAA and MSAA – only with DLAA, there’s no upscaling involved. That means no performance gains, but for those with sufficiently powerful Nvidia RTX GPUs, potentially superior image quality at all resolutions. Even better than DLSS, mayhaps.

                              <span>First announced last year, Endless Dungeon is a top-down, tactical roguelite hero-shooter set in Amplitude&#x27;s Endless universe - yer Endless Legend and Endless Space types. Lots of things with no end, basically. It&#x27;s also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon&#x27;s core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it&#x27;s fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.

Every so often, I jump into a could-go-either-way indie game knowing just a basic bullet point or two. In the case of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel, a survival horror game from Brazilian studio Pulsatrix, that lack of exposure ended up leading to an overall pleasant surprise.
To quickly catch you up to speed: this game has undeniable shades of Resident Evil 7&#x27;s first-person horror and inventory management, with a huge emphasis on solving puzzles, and there&#x27;s a surprisingly deep story to unfurl as you slink around an infested hotel.
I may have gotten extremely lost — twice! — but it all worked out in the end.

One of Steam&#x27;s popular new releases this week is a parody of The Witness, and whether you liked that game or ended up bouncing off it, there&#x27;s fun to be had. The Looker goes to surprisingly great lengths to capture that island-exploring puzzle-solving experience, except it&#x27;s much more concise — above all, it just wants to make you laugh. Also, it&#x27;s free!
I think it&#x27;s something anyone could enjoy, but you&#x27;ll likely appreciate it more if you&#x27;ve cracked far enough into The Witness to know that it&#x27;s not just a typical &quot;puzzle game.&quot;

As we round the corner on this final week of June, I have to admit that, once again, I really haven’t been all that prideful during Pride. This has become something of an unbreakable trend for me. Over the past few years, it’s been difficult to get in the mood for the month living way out in the sticks as I do, not to mention COVID throwing a wrench into everybody’s plans.
With the world just pretending we’re not in a pandemic anymore, it could have been different this year. I’ve been feeling a lot better about myself over the past few months and, despite the fact the county I live in had to have a three-hour Board of Supervisors meeting to even recognize June as Pride Month, my town was actually going to host a Pride event at our local rodeo grounds with drag que…</span>

Online games can be a ton of fun, especially when you&#x27;re getting along with your team and playing well together. What makes multiplayer experiences unbearable, though, are the players who are hellbent on making everyone else&#x27;s lives miserable. The studios behind multiplayer games, like Riot, have been doing everything they can to make sure a few toxic players don&#x27;t ruin it for everyone else, and now they&#x27;re taking even further steps to make sure everyone can play in peace.
Riot published a blog post on Valorant&#x27;s website back in February addressing players&#x27; concerns about toxic players, and that post referenced greater monitoring on voice chat, which is much more difficult to oversee than text. They&#x27;re finally moving forward with th…</span>

Bernie Stolar, former president of Sony Computer Entertainment America and Sega of America, has passed away. The sad news was first announced by Stolar&#x27;s friends before being verified by news outlet Gamesbeat. He was 75.
Stolar, who first entered the video game industry in 1980, had a stellar career that saw him work alongside multiple gaming giants, often being a key figure in the conception, licensing, and release of some landmark hardware. Getting his break with Atari, Stolar would play a key role in the company&#x27;s coin-op division, before eventually transitioning to lead developer on the company&#x27;s handheld console, Atari Lynx.
Later in the 1990s, Stolar would be a founding member of Sony Computer Entertainment America, operating as vice presi…</span>

                              <span>Jane Foster takes to the fray tomorrow
The Mighty Thor, the latest hero to join the battle in Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, arrives tomorrow. Before her launch, Crystal Dynamics has published a gameplay deep dive exploring just how this Mighty Thor is familiar and not-so-familiar for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers players.
The War Table deep dive posted this morning showcases Jane Foster&#x27;s specific set of moves. In the Marvel&#x27;s Avengers continuum, Foster is brought over from another timeline, one where Thor Odinson gave up the hammer.
With Foster as the new wielder of Mjolnir, her moves may look a little familiar. But there are some differences that make the Mighty Thor a bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;zxjz6fFQSJc
The video highlights Jane&#x27;s combo abilities, which can create shockwaves as she hits or adds a catch-and-release mechanic to Mjolnir. Her big move looses Mjolnir on enemies, letting it fly around and pummel foes as she summons another weapon, Undrjarn. Twice the bludgeoning seems like bad news for the bad guys.
Mightiest heroes
While the side-by-side comparisons early on don&#x27;t help Jane feel all too different from Thor, the later abilities do seem to offer a different and distinct playstyle. The visual design of the Mighty Thor is fantastic too; Foster will get her own cosmetics, and they really lean into some fantastic armor and garb.
In today&#x27;s accompanying blog, Crystal Dynamics also confirms it&#x27;s working on more content for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers. Two new challenges will continue to push the narrative efforts forward, with the first being a villain-focused Warzone.
It&#x27;s a good reaffirmation of what&#x27;s in store for Marvel&#x27;s Avengers for anyone wondering what would happen to the project since Square Enix struck the deal with Embracer. Seems like support is still ongoing, at least for the near future. And in the even-nearer future, the Mighty Thor hits Marvel&#x27;s Avengers tomorrow, June 28.

                              <span>Bean there, done that
It seems as though slapstick battle royale title Fall Guys, (previously Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout), is pulling in the punters once again — developer Mediatonic has announced that the past weekend saw the madcap multiplayer game hit a dizzying high of 20 million players, following the release of the long-time-coming Nintendo Switch and Xbox ports as well as the unlocking of Fall Guys as a free-to-play title.
&quot;MASSIVE THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE STUMBLED!&quot; reads an enthusiastic tweet. &quot;We reached an incredible 20 million players in the first 48 hours of Free For All ...see you this weekend my beans!&quot;
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1540711411629707265?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;19cTPmw-jg6FjZkakna5Jg
Originally released on PC and PlayStation back in 2020, Fall Guys quickly won over the hearts of players worldwide with its very silly but immensely compelling action. For the uninitiated, players take control of one of 60 individually controlled &quot;beans&quot; before competing against 59 other players in a series of fun games and challenges to be crowned the Last Bean Standing.
With simplistic controls and gameplay, a welcoming &quot;game show&quot; aesthetic, and an ever-growing wardrobe of silly costumes and accessories, Fall Guys enjoyed a staggeringly healthy launch period, before tapering off somewhat in 2021, though it is still very easy to find a full lobby of players ready to rumble. By adding further console ports, and unlocking the paid entry to the title, Mediatonic has clearly given its smash-hit title a fresh shot of adrenaline, ready to delight and frustrate players all over again.
Fall Guys is available now, free-to-play, on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Valve’s Steam Deck is a cool handheld PC you probably don’t wanna modify too much. However, if the creative juices start flowing and you feel the need to tinker with it, Valve user experience designer Lawrence Yang is at least advising against a mod that increases the literal size of the Deck’s SSD. The reason?…

                              <span>During its annual Spark 2022 conference, Tencent Games unveiled Code: To Jin Yong, a new open-world action title steeped in wuxia literature and created in Unreal Engine 5.
The upcoming game comes from LightSpeed Studio, a Chinese team most notable for developing Apex Legends Mobile and PUBG Mobile. Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. 


Code: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Gamescom returns as a hybrid in-person/online event this August, and the pieces have begun falling into – and in several cases, out of – place. Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.
See you at @gamescom!

Ubisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. 
As for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull &amp; Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Gamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.</span>

                              <span>Valve’s handheld PC and most successful Steam Machine to date is wrapping up its Q2 2022 reservation fulfillment today and will be moving on the Q3 preorders starting next week. The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.
Valve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. 
“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”

This is excellent news for folks waiting to get their hands on a Steam Deck and might be a positive sign to those who have yet to pull the trigger on a reservation. I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. 
If you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.</span>

Below is an obituary written by Steven L. Kent, author and gaming journalist, sent to Game Informer for use, in full: 
Bernard “Bernie” Stolar, a former top executive at Atari, Sony Computer Entertainment America, and Sega of America, passed away at the age of 75.
“Bernie was a low-key guy. He kept his ego in check,” remembers Vince Desi, founder of Running with Scissors. “I’ve known Bernie for a long time, and I’ve never heard him raise his voice. He was a gentleman in an industry where there really aren’t many.” 
Stolar’s introduction to the video game business came with the 1981 release of an arcade game called Shark Attack. Created by Pacific Novelty and manufactured by Game P…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed that a Direct Mini: Partner Showcase is happening tomorrow. 
As many have predicted and expected, Nintendo is hosting a Direct tomorrow, but it&#x27;s not the typical Direct many were hoping to see happen sometime this month to coincide with the rest of the big June gaming showcases. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a Direct Mini that&#x27;s also a partner showcase. This means it will be a smaller-scale Direct (see: mini) focused on third-party titles. However, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean we won&#x27;t see anything from Nintendo&#x27;s first-party studios because surprises can happen – just don&#x27;t go in expecting it. 
A new #NintendoDirectMini: Partner Showcase is on the way! Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel beginning Tuesday, June 28 at 6am PT for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party #NintendoSwitch games.

Not much else is known about the direct, and there aren&#x27;t too many rumors swirling around this partner showcase in regards to specific titles or announcements. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because we&#x27;re less than 24 hours away from this Direct Mini. 
While waiting for tomorrow, read about how Shigeru Miyamoto initially cringed when he saw the art style of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

                              <span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is a beloved game in the long-running Zelda series, but when it was first revealed, the reception was mixed. Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. 
According to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 


“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?&#x27;.&quot; Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.
“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.&#x27;” 
Miyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. 
For more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.

                              <span>The Boys is one of the most popular shows on television right now, with Season 3 currently underway. It’s a brutal show, with hilarious satire and multiple wild characters, but it seemingly didn’t hold the interest of Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima. 
That’s because he quit after watching three episodes of Season 1, but the reason might have to do with more than just interest in the series. In a new series of tweets first spotted by Video Games Chronicle, Kojima has revealed that at one point in the past (likely 2019, which is when the first season of The Boys aired), he was making something similar in concept to The Boys. In fact, he put it on hold because of its similarity.

                              <span>Space Bob vs. The Replicons is an ambitious 2D game about flying your spaceship onto a procedurally generated planet surface, gathering resources and tethering them to your ship, then blasting back into orbit to explore more of outerspace. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it below, but it&#x27;s not a new game. Space Bob launched in 2018, sold poorly, and then its developer left the games industry. That developer is returning now to take a second swing at the game and released a major update earlier this week.

Xbox Game Pass now helps me in my tests by, eventually, adding each iteration, and FIFA 22 is now available through the subscription service as part of June&#x27;s haul of new games.

Also added this past week: the Shadowrun Trilogy, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Naraka: Bladepoint. And Far Cry 5 will arrive on July 1st.

If you bought the game on GOG, you could at least switch over to the superior ScummVM release, but not on Steam... Until earlier today, when Blade Runner Classic was added to the Steam version, too.

                              <span>With its approachable gameplay and chess-like complexity, Into the Breach has been an incredible strategy option for PC and Switch owners. With its upcoming Advanced Edition expansion, new content is getting pumped into the mech tactics games where it can already be played. Even better still, mobile versions are landing the same day with the new DLC bolted right in from the start.


Subset Games, which also developed the space-faring rogue-lite FTL, is releasing the Advanced edition on July 19. It comes new units, weapons, pilots, abilities, and more. For expert players, there will be a more challenging difficulty mode to contend with, along with new bosses and enemies to learn to defeat efficiently and effectively. Here are some bullet points of what to expect in Into the Breach&#x27;s Advanced Edition Update:
Five new mech squads
Nearly 40 new weapons
Four new pilots and new pilot abilities
New enemies, bosses, and missions
More challenging difficulty mode
Seven new languages
New music from Ben Prunty
Into the Breach will be making its mobile device debut on July 19 as well, but these editions are only available for Netflix subscribers. Subset Games promises there are no ads or in-app purchases involved with the mobile app. All you need to access it is to be a Netflix subscriber, and the game is free to access on your iOS and Android device. These versions include a revised touch interface designed to function better on a smaller screen like a cell phone.
For those who like to collect, Into the Breach is going to have a physical edition on Switch courtesy of Fangamer. Preorders are live now, and the boxed copy will be released later this year. This tactile copy of Into the Breach will include the Advanced Edition content listed above but will also come with other physical goodies like a poster, inside cover box art, an instruction manual, and sticker sheets.</span>

                              <span>In the movie Jurassic World Dominion, we see a company called Biosyn operating at full capacity, creating dinosaurs and other dangerous critters at an alarming pace. In Jurassic World Evolution 2&#x27;s new expansion, Dominion Biosyn, you play through this corporation&#x27;s first days and learn how its hunger to bring back never-before-seen dinosaurs takes a turn for the worse.
My time in Biosyn&#x27;s sprawling dinosaur sanctuary was short yet rewarding. The new campaign flows harmlessly from mission to mission, allowing for success with little pushback. Some dinosaurs get sick or may misbehave, but this is essentially a stress-free playthrough that lets you interact with a handful of fantastic new dinosaurs within just an hour or two.
All of the Biosyn dinosaurs are fantastic additions, bringing the r…</span>

                              <span>Jupiter looms large, serving as an imposing backdrop as cargo ship pilot Jacob Lee crashes on the Gas Giant’s second-biggest moon. Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.
Set 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.
In 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.

                              <span>coverage here.

In a recent Reddit AMA, the Overwatch 2 team from Blizzard Entertainment took questions from the community regarding the state of the franchise and the upcoming pseudo-sequel to its popular hero shooter. In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.
When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.

Rather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.
While Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.
Also of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.
Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>Along with the debut of Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands on Steam this week, a brand new DLC has landed for the Bunkers &amp; Badasses-themed shooter. You can check out the trailer for Molten Mirrors below.


Those who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there&#x27;s plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players&#x27; abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. 
However, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn&#x27;t free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.
If you&#x27;re still on the fence about whether to check out Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, read our review to better inform your potential purchasing decision.</span>

                              <span>In an interview with 4Gamer.net, Elden Ring director and president of From Software, Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealed some information about the studio&#x27;s next project and even left some room for the possibility of an Elden Ring sequel. Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.
Regarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year&#x27;s smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don&#x27;t have to wait too long to see what it is. When asked whether that other game was still in development, Miyazaki responded, &quot;Yes. Development is in its final stages.&quot;

                              <span>Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
For those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” 
Speaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how he experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”
Regardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).

                              <span>A popular browser-based Game Boy Advance emulator with nearly 100 working games was removed from GitHub this week. The takedown request was sent by the ESA, which acts on behalf of Nintendo and other game companies. The problem hasn&#x27;t been sorted out completely, however, as nostalgic games can easily find alternatives, even on GitHub.

At the time the name of the &#x27;Doe&#x27; defendant was unknown. This is how a Bungie investigation followed digital breadcrumbs to track down and identify that person by name and physical address.

                              <span>The old school FPS revival has largely left me cold, if I&#x27;m honest. Even the ones I&#x27;ve enjoyed tend to get old within an hour. Most of the things that get recreated aren&#x27;t the things I miss about 90s games, and if they were... Doom still exists, you know? So does Blood, and Strife, and Quake was never that good anyway.


Extraneum is good, though. I think it&#x27;s precisely because it&#x27;s not doing a big song and dance about its influences, although those are very clear. It&#x27;s not big or brash, nor overly stripped down or obnoxious about difficulty. Clean blasty strafey fun, with a tiniest hint of horror. In an odd way, it&#x27;s all the more faithful for that.

                              <span>In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I&#x27;m willing to bet that &quot;pluviophile&quot; would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I&#x27;m doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I&#x27;ll be out frolicking in the downpour before they&#x27;ve hit the floor.
Because I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can&#x27;t. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.
The time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It&#x27;s time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you&#x27;ll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature&#x27;s greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s time to frolick. No umbrella required.

The developer paid illustrators to draw pictures with bees, and you can find the bees. It&#x27;s quite fun to find the bees. I got into hidden object games a few years back with the lovely Hidden Folks and the vast 100 Hidden X series, and today have enjoyed poring over colourful and often surreal landscapes to find our striped friends.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell &quot;Requiem&quot;. The second is &#x27;What would it be like if you had the power of rats?&#x27;. The third is, &#x27;What if rats had any power to have?&#x27;. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.

The trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called &#x27;What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn&#x27;t delayed until next year?&#x27;.

                              <span>There are two reasons to consider playing the new &#x27;Enhanced Edition&#x27; of Blade Runner over the version which hit GOG in 2019: 1) it has controller support; 2) it&#x27;s on consoles. Beyond that, Nightdive&#x27;s remastering has made Westwood&#x27;s 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you&#x27;d be better off with GOG&#x27;s ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I&#x27;ve been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.

                              <span>I still don&#x27;t know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;. Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that&#x27;s something like a fantasy Total War with a D&amp;D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.
It&#x27;s far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much to it at all. That&#x27;s partly because it&#x27;s easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.
And yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you&#x27;re doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it&#x27;s complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.

                              <span>An ongoing crash in cryptocurrency prices is causing some miners to abandon ship, selling off their racks of graphics cards at discount prices in a bid to recoup some cash. Wccftech spotted that some erstwhile miners across China and South Asia, previously encouraged by low energy costs, are even hosting livestreamed auctions to get rid of their GPU ‘stock’ en masse. 


First off: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Second, while it’s entertaining to imagine desperate crypto barons hosting a kind of QVC channel for dusty PC components, I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a long-overdue opportunity to upgrade your graphics card on the cheap.

                              <span>It&#x27;s time once again for an episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast. This week Nate returns, but Matthew is away - and since he is the real agent of chaos, Nate and I have a remarkably sensible conversation about different weather and seasons in a lot of games. Who&#x27;d have thought? Not me. And in fact there is weather in all sorts of places you wouldn&#x27;t expect to look.
Don&#x27;t worry, though, because we find time to talk about how our weeks have been, as well as a bit where I tell Nate there&#x27;s going to be a survival crafting game set in Moria and he gets excited. Also, stay tuned for a Cavern Of Lies where Nate does a lot of cowboy voices. And shout out to John for sending in cheery EWS fan game Aquarium Assault: Dark Day For A Dogfish!

It’s being styled as the ‘Steam 3000’ sale even though that year is a long way off according to my calendar. For some reason, Valve have decided they&#x27;re doing videos to hype this stuff now too. You can watch the trailer below to get some idea of what might be discounted very soon.

Right now, you can pick up a Gigabyte RTX 3060 Eagle 12GB for just £330 at Scan UK, a £61 reduction over the same card at Amazon UK and some £40 cheaper than the cheapest RTX 3060 we spotted last month.

                              <span>The HP Reverb G2 is surprisingly similar take on the Valve Index VR headset, and now it&#x27;s going cheap from HP&#x27;s American web store. The headset, which has a US MSRP of $599, is now going for $399, which according to my abacus is $200 off.

                              <span>Hyenas is a sci-fi, team-based shooter that is not at all what I was expecting next from the developers who make the Total War series. Set in that most dodgy of times, the future, Hyenas is about pilfering relics of pop culture such as Pez dispensers, Mega Drives and Sonic The Hedgehog paraphernalia before tech billionaires who’ve colonised Mars can furnish their homes with it all. You can be bemused at your own leisure by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 3600 is one of the best value gaming CPUs, and now it&#x27;s available for just £170 with a Gigabyte B450M motherboard from AWD-IT. That&#x27;s a £50 reduction from its normal price, and some £22 cheaper than the CPU and cooler on Amazon. This would make an excellent start to a new system, with the 3600&#x27;s six cores and twelve threads pairing well with a modern RTX 20-series or Radeon RX 5000-series or later graphics card.

Having been a fan of the Vampires and Realm Of Magic (a.k.a. wizards, basically) game packs since their respective releases, I can safely say that Werewolves has done an excellent job iterating and expanding on what worked from those previous supernatural outings.

                              <span>I was in LA for Summer Geoff Fest and I played a whole bunch of games. No, not lots of blockbusters – mainly because there weren&#x27;t too many of those about - but lots of indies, instead. In fact, out of all the games I saw or played or glanced at while I dashed between appointments, it was the indies that really stood out.

This time, Randall made several of the RPS team spit out their tea when he revealed that the game’s horse model is really a stretched out human skeleton. That’s some genuinely nightmarish imagery to contemplate first thing in the morning.

                              <span>Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.
The publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.
The result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. 
Although Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.</span>

                              <span>Crystal Dynamics announced in April that Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&#x27; next hero would be Jane Foster as the Mighty Thor. A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.
Mark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane&#x27;s powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans&#x27; appetite for the character&#x27;s Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. 
It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane&#x27;s moveset from Thor&#x27;s. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that&#x27;s something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.

                              <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem finally arrives on October 18, Focus Entertainment announced today during a special broadcast. The release confirmation comes alongside an extended gameplay showing that follows Amicia and Hugo as they attempt to escape an enemy-laden quarry.
You can watch the new demo below to get an in-game look at a slice of the game’s story, as the siblings are pursued by soldiers. This leads to a good showing of the game&#x27;s stealth as the pair sneak around the quarry. Amicia also gets her hands dirty taking out enemies in a showcase of the game&#x27;s action. 


Additionally, a video showcasing the game’s previously announced $189.99 Collector’s Editon provides up-close looks at the Amicia and Hugo resin statue. 


A Plague Tale: Requiem will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also be playable on Switch via cloud streaming.</span>

                              <span>The Biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monstrous antagonists, are as mysterious as they are deadly. To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. 
Longhi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.
“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn&#x27;t have to be real, but it has to feel real, right? That can mean many different things. But in my opinion, it has to be interesti…</span>

                              <span>Welcome back to a new episode of The Game Informer Show! We know what you&#x27;re thinking, and yes, we are aware that Nintendo just put on a Xenoblade 3 digital showcase, but that won&#x27;t stop us from hoping for more. Just like with Sony and Microsoft, we&#x27;re brushing off our crystal balls and predicting what Nintendo will have at its big summer Direct...whenever that may be.
Will The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&#x27;s sequel make an appearance with a more concrete gameplay section and a name reveal? Will Nintendo continue to roll out its iconic characters on Switch with a new Donkey Kong game? Can we expect to see Samus in the form of the rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy port or the much-anticipated Metroid Prime 4? Only time will tell, but we hope today&#x27;s podcast will be a fun distraction while we wait for the next big Nintendo Direct!

In the original story, posted below, he seemingly expressed disappointment that some of Sonic 3&#x27;s music has been swapped out in Sonic Origins due to Jackson&#x27;s connection to it. In a follow-up tweet, he posted: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m being misunderstood a lot, probably because I don&#x27;t speak English and I&#x27;m using a translation tool. Sorry.&quot;

                              <span>No Man&#x27;s Sky creator Hello Games has teamed up with Bandai Namco to bring its hit survival title to the Nintendo Switch. We knew from a Nintendo Direct that aired earlier this year the game was coming to the portable console before today&#x27;s announcement. However, the last mention of the project came with a summer release window, which has now been pushed back. But vague time frames are a thing of the past, No Man&#x27;s Sky is officially coming to the Switch October 7. 
Fans all over the world can pick up either a physical or digital copy of the game come October. In addition to the Nintendo console launch, PlayStation 5 owners will be able to buy a physical remastered edition on the same date. The remaster will come with all the previously released content included, which when tallied up means new-gen PlayStation owners will have access to 20 different updates in total.


Looking over the titles&#x27;s long history and its new leap onto the Switch, Hello Games founder Sean Murray observed the following.
 No Man&#x27;s Sky&#x27;s Switch and PS5 remastered editions are set to release on October 7, but you can also purchase a copy of the game on all major platforms.</span>

                              <span>Atari is among the oldest and most well-known names in the gaming industry, and it’s celebrating its 50th year on June 27. It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.
 “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”
In the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.</span>

                              <span>Sega&#x27;s Creative Assembly is working on a brand-new game revealed today: Hyenas. The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and &quot;engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.&quot; The game&#x27;s debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.


The story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet&#x27;s culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth&#x27;s poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.
The game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it&#x27;s still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas&#x27; alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN&#x27;s Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.</span>

Heading up Striking Distance Studios, the industry icon sits down with us today to go over 83 Rapid-Fire questions focusing on The Callisto Protocol, the horror genre, and so much more!


It&#x27;s Alex Stadnik&#x27;s turn to host, and he has plenty of questions. One of the main focuses is getting to know The Callisto Protocol and what players can expect. We find out basic information such as what kind of weapons we&#x27;ll be using, why the game takes place on the dead moon of Jupiter, and the new gruesome Biophage enemies. We also dive into inspirations, definitively answer a circulating fan theory, and much more.
But this isn&#x27;t Rapid-Fire without some fun, right? We also tell Glen our best Candyman joke, see if things like The Strangers or your mom using your full name are scarier than his upcoming game, and whether or not he can think of five words that rhyme with gore. But what other secrets does Glen have up his sleeve? You&#x27;ll have to watch the video to find out! 
The Callisto Protocol is releasing on December 2, 2022, for PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. Head to our exclusive cover hub below, where you&#x27;ll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days. For more Rapid-Fire fun, check out our curated playlist on YouTube, featuring industry legends such as Tim Schafer, Joseph Staten, and Jake Solomon. Thanks, as always, for watching.</span>

                              <span>Believe it or not, The Callisto Protocol is a scary game. But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs &quot;horror engineering.&quot; 
Horror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three. Imagine Disney’s Imagineering process applied to something much more gruesome. 
Horror engineering stems from the team’s desire to make The Callisto …</span>

The Ghostbusters are back in town and will soon light up specters in a new asymmetrical multiplayer game from IllFonic, the development studio behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds. In an exclusive new look at the studio&#x27;s forthcoming Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, we see four proton packs charge up and ignite against a purple Slimer-like ghost with far too many eyes. This battle unfolds within a prison setting that IlllFonic felt was a must for this game.

The director&#x27;s legal team submitted a motion for judgment, arguing that the movie company&#x27;s claims fall flat. The Pulp Fiction film is a derivative of the screenplay, not the other way around, they stress.

                              <span>In May, former Megaupload executives Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk revealed a deal to avoid extradition to the US by being charged with crimes in New Zealand. Today the men pleaded guilty and both face up to 10 years in prison. Kim Dotcom - who is not part of the deal - congratulated his former friends last month but now accuses them of facilitating Chinese spying.

                              <span>When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.
I know that&#x27;s very boring, but it&#x27;s also positive, isn&#x27;t it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I&#x27;ll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it&#x27;s directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it&#x27;s going to be accessible if you&#x27;re new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it&#x27;s possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.

                              <span>Now that all the unusually stressful benchmarking is out the way, let’s talk how mineral-grubbing “quest shooter” The Cycle: Frontier performs on PC. Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks.

However, the automatically applied update is primarily intended to sort out a variety of daft-sounding exploits. These range from teleporting back to your spawn point by changing loadout or class while touching the other team’s No Entry gate, to Spies disguising themselves and creating an invisible shield at their feet to block incoming fire.

The game soft-launched with a pre-season on June 8th, so its transition into the first season seems to consist largely of the launch of its Fortuna battle pass. Here’s a trailer detailing what the pass entails, below.

That&#x27;s a pretty solid price for what you&#x27;re getting!

                              <span>Bō: Path Of The Teal Lotus launched on Kickstarter back in February and quickly cleared its funding goal for a Metroidvania based on Japanese folklore. It has gained even more attention in the last day or so, because its creation reunites some of the people who worked on AM2R, the well-liked unofficial Metroid 2 remake that Nintendo DMCA&#x27;d out of existence in 2016.

It&#x27;s a tycoon factory builder about forming a technology company and leading it, from product design through hiring staff and all the way to replacing those staff with robots. It looks cute and, as of its departure from Steam Early Access today, robust.

The filing, made last year and published this past week, describes a head-mounted display with a rear housing, and the mechanisms by which that display could be adjusted. It&#x27;s not thrilling stuff - but it is further confirmation that Valve continue to work on designs for VR hardware.

                              <span>I love the name &quot;SpellForce&quot;, mid-word capital letter and all. It conjures a mental image of a kid’s TV show where some, possibly sentai-style, superheroes learn about the importance of spelling and grammar. Maybe a little punctuation, as a treat. SpellForce the video game series isn’t that; it’s a trio of RPG-RTS hybrids which, by the time you read this, will have had a new entry announced in the form of SpellForce: Conquest Of Eo. It’s a fresh, turn-based take on the series which casts the player as a wizard attempting to further their mastery of magic.

                              <span>Since The Cycle: Frontier is having its second (???) launch tomorrow, June 22nd, I thought I’d knock together a performance and settings guide to mark the occasion. This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.


See, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.

Well, turns out that might be at least partly down to a practice called badge-farming. That’s according to industry pundit Simon Carless’ latest GameDiscoverCo newsletter, anyway.

                              <span>So, you went and flubbed a Reservoir Dogs type of deal, and now you’re a dead’un. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it turns out that Heaven is a corrupt bureaucracy that’s absolutely stuffed with shadowy demons and talking cats. Those demons become your problem when god decides to give you a chance to earn your place in Heaven by committing murder - stylish, speedrunning, parkouring demon murder. It’s perdition with extra steps, then, but is it any fun? Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.
The game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop. White is joined by his fellow demon-slaying Neons including Yellow (best boy), Violet (sucks), Red (mysterious), and Green (bad guy).

That was maybe 2018. Now, Raft has finally launched out of early access and whoa what is this game now? Undersea cities to explore? Utopian biodomes? A whole post-apocalyptic story? Friendly wildlife like whales and turtles? More murderous fish? Have a look at the cooperative survival wonders in the new trailer, below.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified &quot;violation of related laws and regulations&quot;.

I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.

                              <span>Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?


No, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.

                              <span>The Callisto Protocol comes from the minds that spawned the Dead Space franchise, and it has more than a little in common with Isaac Clarke’s horrifying adventures. That isn’t to say it doesn’t have plenty of original ideas, but there are several mechanical, narrative, and visual nods that fans of EA’s premier horror franchise will recognize. Here are the biggest overlaps between the two. 
It Stars An Everyman
Jacob Lee, like Isaac Clarke, isn’t a soldier or trained fighter. He’s a cargo ship pilot who crash-lands on Callisto, which leads to his arrest and imprisonment. We don’t know why his arrival put him on the wrong side of the law, only that he “didn’t get a warm reception on Callisto,” according to Striking Distance. Although he can use a gun well enough, don’t expect Jacob to mow th…</span>

                              <span>Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands, the Borderlands-meets-DND spin-off from earlier this year, is finally coming to Steam, publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software announced today. You&#x27;ll be able to play it on June 23.
Two different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, &quot;Chaotic Great Edition.&quot; The latter includes the game&#x27;s season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. 
Across all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: 
The last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. &quot;This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,&quot; Gearbox said in a press release.
According to our reviewer, Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderland is really good. As we said, it&#x27;s &quot;upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.&quot;</span>

These fans come in black without RGB for a stealthy look, can be daisy-chained to make cable management easier and can be controlled via PWM from 200 to 1800RPM. In terms of performance, every review I&#x27;ve found mentions their great value, but they also detail whisper-quiet performance at low RPMs.

                              <span>One of the best parts of Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City itself, a loud and colourful place full of interesting details and decorations. I explored loads on foot, I explored more with the mod adding trains V can ride, and today I&#x27;ve explored even more with a mod adding hovercars. It&#x27;s very cool, and I have only crashed about a hundred times.

                              <span>I realised earlier that today was the last day of Steam Next Fest, and I panicked. I remembered seeing one particular demo on Steam which made my ears prick up and my eyes expand to thrice their usual size, and until now I hadn&#x27;t the time to try it out. So today I carved out a small portion of the day to download and play the demo for Dome Keeper, a wave-based survival game about protecting your glass dome home from alien invaders using a gigantic laser.
Unfortunately, I ended up playing it a little too long, and now I&#x27;ve left myself no time at all to write about why it was so great. Argh. Let me try anyway.

                              <span>The blue hedgehog is back! He goes very fast in his latest instalment, Sonic Frontiers! And lots of fans – naturally – think it looks terrible! The scepticism is understandable. But having gone hands-on with it at Summer Geoff Fest, I&#x27;d like to pose a counter argument: the game needs to be played. Just seeing it with your eyeballs doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Yes, it&#x27;s a weird departure for Sonic, but I am here for it.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get to play as much at Steam Next Fest this weekend as I usually do, partly because I just ran out of time, and partly because the time I did have I spent playing Necrosmith. There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.
Necrosmith is a 2D necromance &#x27;em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron&#x27;s tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that&#x27;s your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they&#x27;re shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.

                              <span>Dinosaurs are cool and scary right? Spiders aren’t so great but they’re definitely biologically intimidating to humans too. Combine the two and you get Shantae developers WayForward’s Spidersaurs, which describes itself as a 2D co-op run’n’gun action game. It’s coming to Steam soon, say WayForward. Try not to get the theme tune stuck in your head when you watch the trailer below.

                              <span>Of all the demos featured in this past week’s Steam Next Fest, indie environmental ‘reverse city-builder’ Terra Nil has performed exceedingly well for itself. The demo has cropped up among the top 50 on the most-played games on Steam over the weekend, and is currently nestled between Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Vampire Survivors. Not bad for a chill game about rewilding a barren planet.

The agreement includes a permanent injunction against Elite Boss Tech that prohibits them from making more software that infringes on Bungie’s. Details of the stipulated consent judgement between the two companies, which has yet to be signed off by the court, were reported by Torrentfreak.

                              <span>A US court has ordered the former operators of pirate IPTV service Nitro TV to pay more than $100m in piracy damages to broadcaster DISH. While the defendants are likely to be somewhat upset, major Hollywood studios are absolutely fuming. Despite their lawsuit against Nitro being filed months earlier, it&#x27;s still not over, allowing DISH to strike first against any available cash.

                              <span>Pirate site blocking is widely regarded as an effective tool to combat online piracy. But just how effective is it?

Old habits die hard apparently; especially when there are still plenty of alternatives.

                              <span>One of the ways Steam wormed its way into every inch of PC gaming was by releasing useful tools that make developers&#x27; lives easier. Epic would like their Epic Games Store to also be wormy, and an early step is, hey, still about Steam.

                              <span>First-person tactical shooter Ready Or Not disappeared from Steam on June 16th, prompting a flurry of rumours as to why. Now it&#x27;s back and the developers say that the removal was because a &quot;takedown request was issued via Steam concerning a suggested trademark infringement in our recent Night Club map.&quot;

Maybe the name gives it away: it&#x27;s Rare&#x27;s GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64, and there&#x27;s currently a demo available to play as part of the Steam Next Fest.

                              <span>An amusing irony of working an anti-piracy job is that people immediately render themselves redundant when they&#x27;re 100% effective. With that scenario unlikely to ever raise its head, anti-piracy jobs are in abundance. Whether you prefer site-blocking,  IPTV disruption, or just want camcording movie pirates brought to justice, there is no shortage of jobs in the UK right now.

                              <span>Not E3 2022 is over. It&#x27;s done. I think? I mean there&#x27;s a Nacon showcase in July but, I mean come on now, we can&#x27;t start classing events that occur outside of June as being part of the event formerly known as E3 can we? That would be preposterous. Before long it would spool out across the entire year, absorbing every month until E3 is a constant series of video events that could happen at any point. Do you want to live in a world where Geoff Keighley
 is allowed to drop a World Premiere at 4PM on Christmas Day? It doesn&#x27;t bear thinking about, really, does it.

If it&#x27;s your turn this time, reader dear, wait one second! Perhaps you might enjoy a twist on this classic immersive sim? The Deus Ex Randomizer mod shuffles just about everything in the game, adding random surprises and new challenges to an old favourite, and it recently released a new version. See its random surprises in the new trailer, below.

                              <span>There&#x27;s something so intriguing about a new survival game. You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.

                              <span>As I might have mentioned once or twice, one of my joys in life is dipping and drifting around rivers and ponds, lochs and seas. I am delighted to see some of the gentle pleasure and wonder of that captured in Naiad, an upcoming game about a water spirit adventuring downstream. It has a free demo in the Steam Next Fest, and it is quite lovely. I believe it to be what the youth call &#x27;wholesome&#x27;.

                              <span>I confess, I was worried about revolutionary robot Soulslike Steelrising. I&#x27;d seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it&#x27;s all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.

Thank you once again from the bottom of our massive elephant hearts to our lovely supporters, who let us have lovely silly chats like this.

                              <span>In 2019, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma director Hideaki Itsuno said Capcom had gaven him the freedom to choice between making a sequel to the fascinating fantasy RPG and making Devil May Cry 5. He went with DMC. But that punchfest has been out for years so...? Yes! Capcom last night announced Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, following a nice presentation where the devs reminisced about making the first game.

                              <span>Back in November, the Wall Street Journal reported that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of some allegations of sexual misconduct among the company’s staff but did not inform the board of directors. Well, Activision Blizzard’s board issued a statement yesterday saying that &quot;an objective review&quot; from external advisors &quot;determined the Board never intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported”, and that there is no evidence &quot;suggesting any attempt by any senior executive or employee to conceal information from the Board.&quot;
In fact, another, separate review of data concludes that &quot;there was no widespread harassment, pattern or practice of harassment, or systemic harassment at Activision Blizzard or at any of its business units&quot; in the United States between September 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2021. Indeed, &quot;based on the volume of reports, the amount of misconduct reflected is comparatively low for a company the size of Activision Blizzard.&quot; You can read the SEC filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in full here.

                              <span>Square Enix’s 25th anniversary livestream for Final Fantasy VII played out in almost textbook fashion for the JRPG giants, starting and ending with the two most important pieces of news for PC players. First up, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade leaves Epic exclusivity to steer its motorbike onto Steam today. Steam Deck compatibility was touted too, you lucky beggars.


Then, after much faffing with mobile games and memorabilia, producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed footage from the second part of Remake, now known as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Kitase also confirmed that the Final Fantasy VII Remake saga might actually be completed in our lifetimes, thanks to Square Enix deciding to draw it to a close with a third, as yet untitled part. Gawp at Sephiroth’s broad shoulders from behind by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.5.1.
No matter if you expect the scorching heat of the upcoming summer or freezing blizzards in winter (depending on your favorite hemisphere): it’s release time again!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list - maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen quite a bunch of changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
The AGOS, SCI and SCUMM engine received some really extensive modifications which make all games using those engines very good testing targets as well.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support!
