                              <span>Defining a strand game
Destiny 2 heads to Neptune with the Lightfall expansion later this month. Today, Bungie is going into a little more detail about the string-like new power Guardians will be using there, also known as Strand.
In a new trailer, Bungie spotlights the three new subclasses for Titans, Hunters, and Warlocks arriving as part of Destiny 2: Lightfall. The Strand powers each vocation in different ways, ranging from high mobility to summoning lots of little guys to wreak havoc.

The Bungie blog goes into more detail, highlighting each of these subclasses. There is some universal terminology, though, when it comes to weaving the Strand power. Creating an object using the Strand is weaving, and killing an enemy affected by Strand will un…</span>

Bad Vice Games, the minds behind the murderous restaurant manager Ravenous Devils, has something different in mind for your next return to the food service industry. Planned for launch in 2024, While We Wait Here has you work your last diner shift before the end of the world.

Set during a typical workday, a global catastrophe gradually unfolds as you serve customers. While We Wait Here will give you the means to cook their desired last meal, and while you do you’ll hear all their reactions to what’s going on beyond the windows of the greasy spoon. There are multiple endings, but no real game over. You simply do your best while riding out the apocalypse.
As someone with an unhealthy interest in life and mortality, this is sadly my exact jam. Maybe blame Majora’s Mask, but a person&#x27;s reaction to the approach of the absolute unknown is fascinating to me. Since none of us really know what things will be like until we actually get there, so fiction is a great, safe way to explore this concept.
Unfortunately, we have some waiting to do. While We Wait Here launches on PC in 2024.

                              <span>Hit the orange track
Velan Studios is working on another mixed reality racing game. Hot Wheels: Rift Rally is a new racing game from the studio behind Mario Kart Live, centered on Mattel&#x27;s line of miniature cars.
Due out on March 14 for iOS and PlayStation, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally operates pretty similarly to Velan&#x27;s Mario Kart Live. Players can set up different gates around their real-world accommodations to create a track, then use the car and built-in camera to race around.
While it&#x27;s all controlled through the game, you&#x27;re also driving the car. So it&#x27;s a pretty solid way to both re-imagine your living room, and keep a high-energy cat occupied.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;b0Q0fYl0pH0
The big difference here is that while your car remains the same in the real world, in-game it can morph into different famous Hot Wheels cars. There are mini-games to compete in and stunts to perform, though some of the fun will also be in seeing what that little car can do. I&#x27;m not advocating for you to set up any sick jumps or dangerous thrill courses, it&#x27;s your money. But a childhood spent assembling orange track segments has me thinking about what kind of courses you could concoct for this RC car.
Rallying around the rift
There&#x27;s also a Campaign mode in Hot Wheels: Rift Rally, where different challenge maps and competitions await. Or in Stunt mode, players can drive around without those pesky gates, free to freestyle to their heart&#x27;s content.
It will run you a decent amount for the kit. The standard edition for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally will go for $129.99, while the Collectors Edition adds in a special-edition RC car, extra McLaren Hot Wheels car, and bonus unlockable car for $149.99.
Hot Wheels: Rift Rally races its way onto iOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 on March 14, 2023.

Ever since the launch of Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1, we&#x27;ve had teases of Geralt of Rivia entering the fray. So we waited. And waited. And now he&#x27;s here, as of February 7, 2023. As is the case with several other crossovers mid-season, Geralt is linked to the battle pass: so you&#x27;ll need it to unlock him. Thankfully though he&#x27;s on a completely separate track, so you aren&#x27;t required to level up the core battle pass at all.
Here&#x27;s a quick rundown on how to nab him.

As an employee of sinister stationary supply company, HellO, you’ll be spending your days ascending the corporate ladder to escape from climbing hellfire. Hell of an Office includes dashing, hooking, and rocket-jumping mechanics to get you moving. It promises over 100 levels across 10 worlds. To keep you motivated, it will pit you against fellow worker drones with online leaderboards.

There isn’t much information right now on what is going to be included in the Early Access, though a demo version featuring 60 levels did its rounds in 2021, and the studio suggests this version will have 100 levels across 10 worlds. There’s also no indication on completion or how long they intend to have it in Early Access.
As someone who writes about video games, I don’t work in an office, nor do I typically work clothed. I have, however, in the past, and while it wasn’t as hellish as this, it’s not something I’m in a hurry to go back to. However, I have been enjoying a recent FPS with a lot of fast running, and I think I’m in the mood for one more focused on that concept.
Hell of an Office dashes to PC via Steam Early Access on March 14, 2023 for $9.99.

If you’ve ever wanted to build your own battleship and then kickflip with it, now’s a good time. TMA Games&#x27; Waves of Steel is fully assembled and has left early access on Steam.
Forget everything you think you know about naval warfare. There are some bad guys out on the seas, and it’s your job to exterminate them. Waves of Steel has you customize your ideal flagship, then sends you out to rain destruction down on anyone unfortunate enough to be in the water. Billed as “fast and accessible,” you’ll be gunning down enemy ships, planes, submarines, and various boss concoctions in your bid to free the seven seas from oppression in its extensive single-player campaign. The boat jumps, and that’s generally enough for me.

I actually really enjoy naval combat when it’s done right. However, even though I wouldn’t consider Waves of Steel as one that’s “done right,” it does its own thing instead and comes out looking just as interesting. I didn’t know I needed an over-the-top fun naval combat game, but now that I’ve seen it, I’m looking forward to trying it out.
Waves of Steel is now available on PC via Steam.

Following a week where several live service titles announced the plans to shut down this year, it&#x27;s nice to be reminded that not all games of the sort are following this trend. Such is the case with Disney Dreamlight Valley. Admittedly, I bounced off it pretty quickly after it launched into early access. But over the past several days, I&#x27;ve found it creeping back into my gaming rotation. The game had a pretty eventful 2022 with a successful launch across all platforms. Looking at the road map that was recently revealed by Gameloft, there will be plenty of reasons to keep playing in 2023.

The game&#x27;s next major update will launch on February 16. Dubbed &quot;A Festival of Friendship,&quot; the Dreamlight…</span>

                              <span>Featuring Denuvo the DRM
If you’ve been holding off on buying Sonic Colors: Ultimate because you want to play it on PC and you can’t stand the Epic Games Store, your day has come. Sort of. Sonic Colors: Ultimate has launched on Steam.
Initially released for the Wii in 2010, Sonic Colors is one of the series’ games held in higher regard. The 2021 “Ultimate” version refurbishes it for newer consoles, remastering the graphics and soundtrack while also adding some additional features. Destructoid’s own Chris Carter described it as “one of the better ones to trot out.” Yeah! Like a pony!
But let’s tug the reins here because reception to the PC port hasn’t been exactly glowing. Steam users are reporting that it’s a pretty rough version filled with “glitches and bugs.” I’ve skimmed through the list of reported issues to see if I could summarize better, but I’ve only succeeded in finding that “everything” is broken. Audio, graphics, UI, and controls. Of course, being on the PC platform means that most people will get a different experience based on minute differences in both the hardware and software environment they’re running.
However, you should also note that Sonic Colors: Ultimate also comes saddled with Denuvo DRM.

It’s unlikely a patch is coming to fix things anytime soon, as this is the same version as what was released on the Epic Games Store over a year ago, and it’s still in the same rough shape. I’m not suggesting you avoid this release entirely–I’m not your game-mom–just know what you’re potentially getting into.
Sonic Colors: Ultimate is available on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and on PC through the Epic Games Store and Steam.

                              <span>Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet surpass expectations as well
Just today we touched base with Nintendo to see how their top 10 all-time best-seller list for Switch was doing, and Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet kind of smashed the windows on the way in. It turns out a few other games are doing well, too!
Nintendo reports that Splatoon 3 has sold 10.13 million units since its September 2022 launch, firmly placing it just outside of the top 10 list, somewhat in reach of Pokemon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu/Eevee&#x27;s 15.07 million. It just needs to best two more games to catch up to Splatoon 2, and four more games to crack the top 10. Given how Splatoon games typically have decent tails, it should at least climb a few more spots before it settles in.
In the wide world of digital recreational activity, Nintendo Switch Sports commanded a respectable 8.61 million units, putting it directly in the top 20 all-time best-selling Switch game list. This kind of came out of nowhere for me, as I hardly ever hear about it in passing, but there&#x27;s likely enough nostalgia there for the original Nintendo-branded &quot;Sports&quot; series that you just don&#x27;t ponder on a regular basis.
Big picture, Nintendo now has 27 games that are million-sellers; with Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Mario Strikers: Battle League, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and Pokemon Legends: Arceus joining those ranks in 2022.

                              <span>The marquee &quot;Direct&quot; is back
We&#x27;ve had Xbox Directs, we&#x27;ve had Sony &quot;Directs,&quot; and pretty much everyone tries to shoehorn &quot;Direct&quot; into their streaming titles these days: but the prodigal son has returned. Nintendo is hosting a tried and true Nintendo Direct on February 8 at 5PM ET, which will run &quot;roughly 40 minutes.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from Nintendo, since I know you Direct-heads love to get the full scoop:
&quot;Tune in tomorrow, Feb. 8, at 2 p.m. PT for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching in the first half of 2023.&quot;

That&#x27;s basically everything I already recapped above: with no extra special provisos (like &quot;X will not be shown&quot;). 40 minutes is a meaty timeframe, and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom does fit into that &quot;first half&quot; bit. For reference, the last proper Direct was held on September 13, 2022.
As far as what to expect, we&#x27;ll likely see a recap of things that were revealed in the last week, like Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land Switch additions, as well as the long-rumored final release date (or instant drop) of Advance Wars Switch. Fans have been waiting years to hear any major updates for Hollow Knight: Silksong, among other first-party games like Metroid Prime 4 and Pikmin 4.
Either way, tune in and follow along with the news on Destructoid&#x27;s front page on February 8. Covering these is like a reflex for us!

                              <span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is still on top
Nintendo has provided new top-selling investor relations software sales data on its official site, and the top 10 has shifted slightly. So what changed?
Well, interestingly enough, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl dropped off the list entirely, despite holding firm at the number eight slot the last time we checked in. Essentially taking its spot in the top 10, Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet shot up to seventh place, while Super Mario Party, Ring Fit Adventure, and Pokemon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu/Eevee refused to leave. The top six best-sellers (below) remain exactly the same.
In terms of sales, everything shot up a bit, ranging from 1-4 million more sales since the last September 30 2022 marker, with Mario Kart 8 pushing a remarkable 1.6 million units in that timeframe. You can see why it continues to shoot out DLC! Other top games held on, including Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which will likely continue getting a big bump from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom throughout the year.
As for what&#x27;s next, expect Scarlet &amp; Violet to climb considerably, likely overtaking Pokemon Sword/Shield eventually as the best-selling Pokemon game on Switch. It&#x27;s a shame Legends still isn&#x27;t anywhere to be found!
Here&#x27;s the full Switch best-seller list as of December 31, 2022
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 52 million
Animal Crossing: New Horizons - 41.59 million
Smash Ultimate - 30.44 million
Zelda: Breath of the Wild - 29 million
Pokemon Sword/Shield - 25.68 million
Super Mario Odyssey - 25.12 million
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet - 20.61 million
Super Mario Party - 18.79 million
Ring Fit Adventure - 15.22 million
Pokemon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu/Eevee - 15.07 million

If last week&#x27;s The Last of Us had you eagerly awaiting what&#x27;s ahead, you won&#x27;t have to wait quite so long for the next one. Episode 5 of The Last of Us will be streaming a few days earlier, on February 10 at 9 p.m. ET.
This perk will be available for both HBO Max users, who will be able to check out the new episode a little bit earlier. It will still make its HBO premiere on Sunday, February 12 at 9 p.m. ET. This is the one and only episode to do so, as the rest will continue to air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.
https://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1622611081087844352
Why the two-day early premiere? Well, no official reason was given in HBO&#x27;s press release. But those tuned into the sports world already know. This weekend is the Super Bowl, and it looks like HBO might look to avoid a direct clash between its new episode and massive sporting event.
Though other competition has existed for the Sunday slot, and The Last of Us has won out, it seems like HBO is making an effort to avoid the clash for this particular event. Thus, Episode 5 of The Last of Us will go live a little bit earlier. At least that&#x27;s less waiting between cliffhangers.
Last Friday night
It&#x27;s at least a good sign for the series that HBO wants to keep its momentum rolling. The show has garnered general praise, and seems to at least be on the upper-end of the scale compared to most live-action video game adaptations.
The first season is expected to run through March 12, which is when its finale airs. It&#x27;s already been renewed for a second season as well, so HBO really does seem to be betting on The Last of Us.
Meanwhile, PC fans holding out for the chance to play the first installment themselves are waiting a little longer, as the PC port of The Last of Us Part I has been pushed back further into March.

Movie-licensed games have long been given a bad rap, but to be fair to them, that’s only because they’re usually bad.

While based on Zen 2, the shear multi-threaded compute power of the Threadripper 3990X still bodes well today. Besides 64 cores / 128 threads still being a lot, Linux software improvements over the past three years have helped maintain the competitiveness of the Threadripper 3990X. In today&#x27;s benchmarks are results from the System76 Thelio Major as tested back in 2020 based on Pop!_OS / Ubuntu 22.04 LTS compared to the very latest state today when running an Ubuntu 23.04 snapshot on the same system and using a Linux 6.2 Git kernel.</span>

Update : We all got collectively freaked out by the initial trailer and demo footage for Bramble: The Mountain King back in December last year and now Merge Games has announced that the title will be crawling its way onto Switch on 27th April.
This news was shared alongside a new release date trailer which gives a closer look at the kind of chills that will be coming our way in a couple of months. This trailer does come with a warning that it may be inappropriate for some users, so take care when watching (if you&#x27;re old enough, that is).

As part of its nine-month financial report today, Nintendo has revealed that the Switch has now reached an astonishing 994.30 million in software sales, putting the console well above the Nintendo DS with 948.76 million.
Back in November when Nintendo released its Q2 earnings report, the software sales were sitting at 917.59 million, meaning there has been a massive increase of 76.71 million between then and now. Clearly, games like Splatoon 3 and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet contributed to this milestone significantly, with the former exceeding 10 million in sales and the latter 20 million.

Bayonetta 3 is the latest Switch exclusive to join the 1 million club. In Nintendo&#x27;s latest financial report, the company reports that the long-awaited sequel from PlatinumGames just squeaked over the line with 1.04 million units sold.
Launching early-ish into Q3, those sales figures are pretty decent for the Umbra Witch&#x27;s third outing. The Switch version of Bayonetta 2 managed to hit 1.04 million units by December 2021, while it struggled to even reach 400k on the Wii U. The first Bayonetta has seen multiple releases, first launching on the PS3 and Xbox 360, and managed 2 million copies between those systems.

The latest Nintendo financial report is here, giving us a good old look at the company&#x27;s sales figures up until the end of 2022. While this time around has been a big one for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and for the Switch itself, there has (predictably) been yet more success for the behemoth titles of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
Let&#x27;s kick things off with the plumber&#x27;s latest racer. We all know that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been a big seller for Nintendo — heck, it has been the company&#x27;s best-selling game for a long while now — but just when we thought that there were no more milestones left to cross, the game careers around the corner to take home yet another trophy.

Nintendo has revealed that Splatoon 3 has sold over 10 million units up to 31st December 2022. The company shared the result in its latest financial report, which covers the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2023.
We knew Splatoon 3 would sell well given that it absolutely smashed sales records when it launched back in September 2022, particularly in Japan, but the game has already sold 10.13 million units. To put that into context, Splatoon 2 reached 10.71 million units in June 2020, almost three years after the game&#x27;s release, and as of March 2022, the second game has sold 13.30 million units.

We&#x27;ve seen Zelda recreated in Minecraft before, but this latest project by YouTuber C1OUS3R takes it to the next level.
Instead of calling on third-party Minecraft mods and resource packs to work some magic, they&#x27;ve managed to recreate Link&#x27;s original top-down 2D adventure by editing textures and exploiting certain in-game features using only the &quot;vanilla&quot; command block functions to make it &quot;accessible as possible&quot;.

It&#x27;s Kate&#x27;s last day at Nintendo Life, and that means being terribly self-indulgent. And what&#x27;s more self-indulgent than talking about the Ace Attorney games for an hour?
From the beloved Ace Attorney trilogy to the underrated eShop exclusives of Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice — and even including the niche crossover event that was Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright and the untranslated Miles Edgeworth Investigations 2 — Zion and Kate explore every single game as much as they possibly can in 60 minutes.

Deliver Us Mars follows in the footsteps of hidden gem Deliver Us The Moon, a game with enjoyable puzzle-solving and storytelling that mostly overcame its technical and presentational shortcomings. The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.   
Despite being a direct sequel, you don’t need to play Deliver Us The Moon to grasp Mars’ plot. Earth has spiraled into an irreve…</span>

The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it&#x27;s always possible they&#x27;ll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow&#x27;s Direct? Let us know in the comments.</span>

This new mixed-reality racing game comes by way of a collaboration with toy maker Mattel, playing off the experience the studio accrued through past games.
Much like Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally comes with a physical remote-controlled car, as well as physical course-creation elements, allowing players to design their own tracks within their house and race using the device&#x27;s camera. The aptly named Chameleon physical RC car used for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally can digitally transform into more than 140 different vehicle variations, including iconic Hot Wheels vehicles like Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Mach Speeder, and more.

                              <span>Space management sim The Last Starship has moved early access plans forward from a hazy Spring release to next week on February 15th. Coming from Prison Architect’s devs, Last Starship has you build and customise your own fleet of spacecraft before taking them on various missions. If you want to try this spaceship builder now, there’s a free demo available on Steam as part of Steam’s Next Fest.

                              <span>You know, I always figured I’d be great at making potions. As a kid, I was obsessed with pulling things out of cupboards and combining them into a bowl. Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. 


As I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn&#x27;t posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.

It seems I wasn’t alone, as over 350 fans have collaborated on Celeste Strawberry Jam, the “largest collaborative project in Celeste history.” The mega-mod is adding 111 stages, five difficulty modes, and over 8 hours of original music on February 17th.

It&#x27;s down from £196 to £157, thanks to a 20% off voucher you tick on the product page at Amazon UK, and well worth picking up for that price - especially as the drive comes with a heatsink attached.

                              <span>Last week, I finished the free Tomb Raider DLC for PowerWash Simulator, in which you pressure-blast scum off Lara Croft&#x27;s ancestral home. It&#x27;s a great DLC, not just because it has loads of nods to the older Tomb Raider games, but also because if you&#x27;re just in it for the powerwashing, you&#x27;ve got some lovely levels to clean, with nooks and crannies and satisfying walls to scour. My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.

                              <span>We’ve seen Austin Powers take a stab at running the Normandy, but the 60s spy is probably too old school to be fighting Reapers in the year 2183. The head of the Normandy requires a modern managerial style, someone with the diplomatic skills necessary to bring the galaxy together. So, obviously, the natural choice to replace Commander Shepard is… Michael Scott? Someone made a video editing The Office’s nutty boss into scenes from the Mass Effect trilogy, and the results are hilarious.

                              <span>Relax, friend. That momentary disappointment you feel at the prospect of no new Legend being added with Season 16 of Apex Legends? Allow me to assuage it with exciting news about what the devs have been working on instead. Namely - a complete rework of the Legend classes and perks system; a new top-tier burst Assault Rifle; a rotating playlist of limited time modes, including the new Team Deathmatch mode; improved onboarding for new players; and much more.
Read more about all the major changes coming with Apex Legends Revelry on Tuesday 14th February below, and join me as I aggressively chew the walls in anticipation of the five new character classes that are about to shake up the Legend meta.

                              <span>Although my favourite type of witch is a spooky old crone, who cackles at the top of her lungs and lives in a swamp crunching rat bones and squeezing crow blood into her cauldron, the laid-back cottagecore witch is a close second. What&#x27;s not to love? Living in a cute little thatched roof house, tending to your garden, baking bread, sipping magical teas, reading old tomes on the front porch - absolute bliss.
Witchy Life Story is all about this lifestyle. It’s a fluffy, cosy visual novel where you play as a mischievous witch who is sent to live in a new town called Flora to prove themselves after royally flubbing their training. The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.

Blizzard have released a brand new trailer alongside a Season 3 roadmap, detailing everything we can expect for the next few months including a One Punch Man crossover, a long overdue dating sim, and a Battle Pass themed around Asian mythology.

                              <span>Darkest Dungeon 2 has been in early access since 2021, and it’s finally taking the roadtrip to a full 1.0 PC release on May 8th. We originally thought the nail-biting roguelike would see a 1.0 release this month, but developer Red Hook haven&#x27;t left us empty-handed. Darkest Dungeon 2 currently has a demo available on Steam and the Epic Games Store until the end of Steam Next Fest on February 13th. Red Hook say the demo will feature the four starting heroes as you take them around one full region and explore either the Sprawl (city) or the Foeter (farms.)

                              <span>Some of my favourite games involve visiting a fantastical town, befriending the residents, discovering their stories, and trading with them. Too often those same games also have too-difficult turn-based murderfests in-between, though. Here comes Townseek to fix that. It&#x27;s an adorable and &quot;relaxing&quot; exploration-trading game in which you pilot an airship, customise your balloon, and visit eg. some sort of bee kingdom, as per the screenshot above.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is prepping for release on February 10, but the provided review code allowed for a review embargo that was lifted earlier today. After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.
In that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix. For gamers familiar with the books or movies, it’s great fun to explore the massive cast…</span>

                              <span>After spending a couple of years coming together in early access, Darkest Dungeon II is ready to go 1.0 this May. Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.
Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.
Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. 
You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store. To learn more, check out our feature on the game&#x27;s new hero, the Runaway and a list of its most challenging enemies thus far.</span>

                              <span>After its launch in October of last year, Overwatch 2 is ready to kick off its third season of content on February 7. This season delivers several facets of new content, including a new Antarctica Control map, Asian Mythology theme, and a Kiriko Mythic skin. On top of that, Blizzard announced some unexpected additions to its Overwatch offerings, including the first IP collaboration as well as a web-based game to coincide with Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Antarctica joins the map rotation in Season 3. While players are already familiar with Earth&#x27;s least-populated continent through Ecopoint: Antarctica, this map features unique locations, including an ice-breaker ship and an underground drilling station. The map allows players to take the high-ground or sneaky flank routes to reach their objectives.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Grammy awards ceremony was the first ever to include a category for the best score soundtrack for a video game, and last year&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla expansion, Dawn of Ragnarok, took home the win. 
More specifically, the DLC&#x27;s composer, Stephanie Economou, won the Grammy for her score in the game. Her other credits include Netflix&#x27;s Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked &quot;all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,&quot; thanking them for &quot;acknowledging and validating the power of game music.&quot; 


Variety also reports that prior to this year&#x27;s Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show&#x27;s score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012&#x27;s Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Economou&#x27;s Grammy was awarded during the main show&#x27;s pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game&#x27;s name last night is any indication.

Red Hook Studios has announced that Darkest Dungeon II will end its early access run on Epic Games Store and enter the light on May 8, 2023. The game is a follow-up to 2016’s Darkest Dungeon, a title focused on the mental rigors of dungeon delving.
Rather than simply focus on being an adventuresome RPG, Darkest Dungeon gave your party the glossy sheen of human weaknesses. Instead of being buff and daftly courageous heroes, your group would be affected by the horrors that they saw in the gloom beneath the earth.

Darkest Dungeon II continues the series’ take on stress management but makes wholesale changes to a lot of the system. A focus for a lot of pre-release information is the wagon that you drive to travel the game world, but the combat system has been reworked. A lot has changed alongside that, and a many players voiced their disappointment in 2021 when the early access period launched. While I can’t personally speak to any of the changes that have been made or the quality, I have heard that the devs have been active about collecting feedback and tweaking the game based on that. Hopefully, this meant that the final release in a few months will meet expectations.
I didn’t play the first Darkest Dungeon because people told me that it’s really depressing. Maybe I should give it a go once I give my therapist a proper warning.
If you’re unsure about the changes made, a demo has been made available as part of Steam Next Fest. Although the Early Access was exclusive to Epic Games Store, the full title will be available on both EGS and Steam when it launches on May 8, 2023.

                              <span>Discover the secrets hidden away in shadows
If you&#x27;ve wished that action-platformers would lean a little more in the horror side, then Plot Twist&#x27;s new game might be up your alley. The Last Case of Benedict Fox is due to arrive on April 27 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it&#x27;s coming to Game Pass.
Playing as the titular Benedict Fox, your goal is to uncover your father&#x27;s secrets following his untimely demise. Benedict isn&#x27;t alone, however; he&#x27;s accompanied by a strange, intimidating demon companion, and as he delves deeper into his father&#x27;s memories, he&#x27;ll also peer deeper into the abyss.
It&#x27;s easy enough to sum up Benedict Fox by describing it as &quot;Lovecraft meets Metroidvania,&quot; but seeing it play out, the blend works. Developer Plot Twist put out a new guided gameplay look today, showing how investigation and mystery are in store for Benedict alongside the action.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PKvv--Yc5Yk
Defeating enemies lets Benedict build up ink, which he can then use to tattoo himself for more power. I dig the way these intersecting systems feed into the darker side of the story. It seems like The Last Case of Benedict Fox might be a good pick-up for those who want some more horror in their Metroidvanias.
Joining the pass
Benedict Fox is one of four games highlighted as coming to Xbox Game Pass today over on the Xbox Wire. The other games included are space-sim Everspace 2, side-scrolling narrative adventure Planet of Lana, and co-op mech-farming game Lightyear Frontier.
It&#x27;s a pretty wide array of video game styles, and it&#x27;s always nice to see a good variety of games headed to the Pass alongside the big Microsoft titles. Even though some big games are going to be swallowing up the oxygen for the foreseeable future, it&#x27;s nice to get a spotlight on cool and interesting new games like The Last Case of Benedict Fox.

Good Smile Company has some more Guilty Gear on the way, and this time, it&#x27;s all about Bridget. A new plush of Bridget, the yo-yo wielding fighter who made her re-entrance in Guilty Gear Strive not too long ago, is on the way.
The Bridget plush specifically highlights her Guilty Gear Strive appearance, down to blue hood and handcuff belt. The plush will go on sale first in Japan, but the Good Smile U.S. shop has pre-orders open. The plush will run $40.99 and is expected to start rolling out for Canada and the U.S. in August 2023.
https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1622429897695137792
The Bridget plush itself is 7.87 inches in height, made of polyester, and is super rad. So if you want to spotlight your main or just have a cute plush of a character you dig, it seems like a solid way to check that box.
Doll fighter
Bridget has been in the Guilty Gear series for quite a while, but made her return to the modern roster last year in Guilty Gear Strive . A major part of her storyline was coming to terms with her upbringing and identity, eventually affirming her own sense of self. And somehow, Goldlewis Dickinson plays a role in it.
It&#x27;s a heartwarming story, and that popularity ties in well with her yo-yo-flinging arsenal of moves and Strive&#x27;s absolutely incredible style. So whether you&#x27;re a new Bridget main or a longtime fan, now you&#x27;ve got a pretty decent merch option to clip onto your bag before the next Evo rolls around.
Guilty Gear Strive is gearing up for another year of content, with an Xbox launch on the way. A cross-platform beta just took place too, so hopefully this means the online pool will be even larger as the year goes on. It&#x27;s looking like there&#x27;s still plenty of Strive on its way.

There has been a massive NBA Jam-sized hole in my heart for quite a long time now. EA Sports managed to achieve perfection with NBA Jam: On Fire Edition back in 2011, and whenever EA does a good thing, it’s usually a mistake, and they quickly bury it under the crawlspace with all the other talented developers. So, until the police manage to get a warrant and dig up all those bodies, I’ve been on the lookout for a game that captures the same razzle-dazzle.
Jollypunch&#x27;s RoboDunk seems to be built entirely on the same philosophy. Here we have two-on-two basketball where the dunk is king. Each team is comprised entirely of Lego-like robots, and they’re out to prove that their skills pay the bills. I’ve had my eye on it for a while now, and with Steam Next Fest in swing once…</span>

                              <span>Uh-oh, other people
Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG. I knew this before I started playing it, and I also knew that the second &quot;M&quot; in that acronym would represent a problem for me. I don&#x27;t play a lot of MMOs specifically because they require a team. A party of other players is necessary to run dungeons and make meaningful progress. I don&#x27;t have many friends willing to commit to an MMO, so that party is almost always comprised of strangers. And when strangers are relying on me, I tend to get really anxious really fast.
The basic idea of an online game isn&#x27;t what stresses me out. I play plenty of online games. I don&#x27;t mind trying something like Magic the Gathering Arena or Halo Infinite&#x27;s FFA Slayer mode, where I only have myself to worry about when I inevitably faceplant. I&#x27;ll even occasional…</span>

                              <span>One more chance to try Wo Long out
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty arrives pretty soon, but if you&#x27;re still unsure or just want to play more of it, there will be one more chance before release. A final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo is going live on February 24, 2023.
Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja&#x27;s new action-RPG will have this demo for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty up from Feb. 24 through March 26, 2023. The new and final demo will be available on all systems it&#x27;s releasing on too, which are Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PS5, and PC.
The final demo will feature Chapter 1: Village of Calamity and Chapter 2: Two Chivalrous Heroes. This start from the earlier chapters of the game is also good for prospective buyers, as save data can transfer over to the main game. Doing this will also net you the &quot;Crouching Dragon Helmet&quot; item.

Online multiplayer will also be available in the final Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty demo. And a special launch window &quot;Baihu Armor&quot; has been revealed for anyone who gets the game by March 16, alongside the digital pre-order &quot;Zhuque Armor&quot; bonus.
Dynasty warriors
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has been quietly creeping up lists for games to keep an eye on this year. The latest action-RPG from Team Ninja does seem to carry on ideas from Nioh, while set in the Three Kingdoms era of China.
While FromSoftware is well known for its ability to craft a punishing fantasy action-RPG, Team NInja has been honing its own skills within the genre. And from the impression we had with a recent hands-on, it seems like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is coming together to be a surprise hit for those who haven&#x27;t been keeping an eye on it.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is out on March 3 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.

Devolver Digital has announced that it will be bringing is More8Bit’s lo-fi action-adventure title to Switch and PC this year in Bleak Sword DX. While the title has been on Apple Arcade since 2019, Bleak Sword DX promises to be an “upgraded and definitive” version.
If you missed it because you don’t have phone, Bleak Sword is a diorama-style slasher that drops your pixelated self into action setpieces. True to its name, Bleak Sword features dark fantasy rendered in stylized pixel art, giving it an unnerving lo-fi feel. Rather than a cohesive adventure, each level is represented as a battle on a square of land.

You can play a Bleak Sword DX demo now
The demo is available as part of Steam Next Fest. I fired it up and gave it a playthrough in preparation for writing this. While you can see its retro roots in its rapid-fire pick-up-and-play design, its combat feels more akin to something like Tunic. You watch enemy patterns, roll out of the way, and parry when it feels safe to. The brief levels and simplistic foundation leave a bit to be desired, but it’s definitely not a bad experience at first impression. Notably, the soundtrack is done by Jim Guthrie, which is always a big draw for me.
Bleak Sword DX features a new mode with extra chapters and new level layouts. Beyond that, there are randomizer and boss rush modes. The visuals have also been tweaked to better fit the new platforms it finds itself on. The AI is “enhanced,” and there are additions to the combat system (like the aforementioned parry.)
Bleak Sword is currently available on iOS through Apple arcade. Bleak Sword DX will be available on Switch and PC later in 2023. Currently, you can try out the first chapter in the demo for Steam Next Fest.

                              <span>What will the next few years bring for Nintendo?
As we wait to see what Nintendo has up their sleeve next in terms of hardware, fans have endlessly created concepts based on that speculation. Not only have they come up with mockups for brand new systems; they&#x27;ve also crafted incredible official-looking spinoffs of existing hardware.
That includes this &quot;Switch Lite OLED&quot; (from Redditor willierthanyou) themed after the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

Would you buy a Switch Lite OLED?
So far, Nintendo has released a Switch Lite, and a Switch OLED: but not a Switch Lite OLED. There&#x27;s no such limitations in mockup land though, as this Switch Lite OLED goes with the color scheme from the logo (and the general aesthetic of the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Sheikah tech). The back is adorned with a Triforce symbol, along with a cool little neon effect. Since it&#x27;s a Switch Lite, the Joy-Con do not detach.
The same creator also dabbled in a custom Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Joy-Con mockup (as well as a Switch Dock) if you&#x27;re interested in these designs. More of their designs can be found on their Instagram account if you dig them!
It&#x27;s just a matter of time until Nintendo unveils more official creations for all of their AAA games coming this year. For now, we can enjoy some more works from the community.

Overwatch 2 now has custom game moderation and &quot;disruptive voice chat detection&quot;
This is the big one. The workshop system and custom games have been causing issues since launch, and Blizzard is trying to &quot;provide ways to make sure custom games remain safe and enjoyable for all players.&quot; Moderation tools will &quot;automatically remove custom games containing inappropriate titles or content,&quot; while penalizing accounts that do so.

Daedalic Entertainment has announced it has teamed up with Spitfire Interactive to create Capes, a turn-based super-hero strategy game coming to consoles and PC sometime this year. Spitfire Interactive is a developer formed by members of Defiant Development, creators of Hand of Fate. Perhaps more notably, the team is being headed by Morgan Jaffit, who was a member of Irrational Games during the development of one of the turn-based super-hero genre’s earliest members, 2002’s Freedom Force.
Capes takes place in a world where evil has long since triumphed, and the development of super-powers is illegal. Keep that in mind next time you forget to take the tinfoil off a baked potato before microwaving it or peel the do-not-remove tag off a mattress. You mig…</span>

                              <span>Sharing the wealth
February is a packed month, and part of that is due to the Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion arriving in a few weeks. Before that happens Reddit user goboy3133 has done a public service of sorts: sharing the contents of the Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition with the world.
Bungie is no stranger to esoteric puzzles and scavenger hunts, and we&#x27;re getting another one in the Collector&#x27;s Edition itself. Beyond story bits (including Vanguard Reports on various story facets dealing with Osiris, Calus, and Elsie, all of which are available to read in the above link), Bungie has also hidden redemption codes for Destiny 2 emblems in the Collector&#x27;s Edition reports.
As usual the community answered the call, and uncovered all of them. If you want to grab the Destiny 2: Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition for yourself and figure out the puzzles within: stop here!
All Destiny 2 Lightfall Collectors Edition emblem codes
Note that the first code can only be redeemed once (typically by the owner of the Lightfall Collector&#x27;s Edition). The rest can be used openly, and goboy3133 has created instant-redemption Bungie.net links for them, which can be found below. I tried them out myself: they work! You just need to sign into Bungie.net with the platform of your choice, and you&#x27;re good to go. If the links don&#x27;t work for whatever reason, you can enter them manually here.
LF CE Emblem 1: (Can only be redeemed once)

Tonight is the biggest night and music, and for composer Stephanie Economou, it might be one of the biggest nights of her career. The seasoned musician was one of five people up for a Grammy this year for video game music. This is the first year the category has been a part of the show, and given how instrumental music is to the gaming industry and how easy it is to access your favorite scores on Spotify and Apple Music, one would hope it will be here for many years to come. The award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, which is the award&#x27;s official name, was handed out in the Grammy&#x27;s pre-show, going to Economou for her work on the score soundtrack for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok.
Dawn of Ragnarok is the expansion for AC Valhalla that was released in March of last year to decent reviews. Clearly, the music from the game was more than just decent as Economou managed to take the gramophone over some pretty tough competition. Other nominees including in this inaugural batch were Austin Wintory for Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Christopher Tin for Old World.
Expect to see Bear McCreary up for this award again next year with his work on the Game Award-winning score to God of War: Ragnarok. Here&#x27;s to hoping with this category around, we&#x27;ll start seeing every video game publisher releasing their scores and soundtracks commercially. I know I would appreciate having the entirety of the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 soundtrack at the ready for when I take my walks every day.

                              <span>Fedora 38 nabídne celý Flathub. Od Fedory 35 platí, že pokud si v edici Workstation při úvodním nastavení povolíte zdroje třetích stran, nastaví se vám mezi těmito zdroji také Flathub. Ten k dnešnímu dni nabízí zhruba 2000 aplikací ve formátu Flatpak, mezi nimiž naleznete i ty proprietární, které ve Fedoře nejsou k dispozici. Doteď se ale Flathub nastavoval pouze ve filtrované podobě. Dokud si uživatel sám Flathub nepřidal, měl z tohoto zdroje k dispozici jen krátký seznam schválených aplikací. To se změní s Fedorou 38. FESCo schválilo návrh, podle kterého se po povolení zdrojů třetích stran nastaví nefiltrovaný Flathub. Uživatel tak bude mít po zaškrtnutí jedné volby k dispozici stovky dalších aplikací včetně těch populárních jako Steam, VLC, Chrome nebo Spotify. Oficiální repozitáře Fedory ale budou mít i nadále prioritu. To znamená, že když se bude aplikace nacházet jak v repozitářích Fedory, tak na Flathubu, v GNOME Software bude vždy předvolená verze z Fedory.</span>

                              <span>Last year, a U.S. federal court handed a 40-month prison sentence to Gary Bowser for this role in the infamous Team-Xecuter group. The Canadian pleaded guilty to being part of the Nintendo hacking group and is now hoping for an early release. However, in a phone call with Nick Moses, Bowser reveals that his looming freedom will present its own challenges.

We know there are a lot of Metroidvanias out there. But after spending about three hours with Afterimage, we&#x27;re pretty confident in saying that this is one of the prettiest we&#x27;ve ever played. Even before we got our hands on the game, Afterimage stood out to us with its stunning hand-drawn visuals. Even next to the likes of Hollow Knight, Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, Islets, and Indivisible, it&#x27;s a real feast for the eyes with its beautiful locations, gorgeous character art, and soft colours. Seeing it in motion only made us fall in love with the visuals even more.
As part of Modus Games&#x27; spring showcase, we were given the opportunity to check out a PC demo of this Metroidvania from developer Aurogon Shanghai. Afterimage smashed through its Kickstarter goal last April, and it&#x27;s coming to Switch (plus Steam and other consoles) on 25th April 2023.

Bleak Sword released on Apple Arcade back in 2019 and has since gone on to receive positive reviews across the board. Now the title is making the leap from decidedly difficult mobile app to brutal Switch game, as Devolver Digital has announced that Bleak Sword DX will be dodge rolling its way onto the Nintendo console this year.
For those who have never come across the game in its original form before, allow us to fill you in. Developed by studio more8bit, Bleak Sword sees you making your way through a series of chapters (nine in the mobile game, 12 this time around) to lift a curse by disposing of any monsters, creatures or any other beasties that come your way.

                              <span>Steam Next Fest is back with a veritable truck ton of fresh game demos to sample, and we&#x27;ve been plunging our eager little mitts into the latest batch of indie delights to unearth some handy recommendations for you to hit first. Running from now until February 13th, there are always oodles of demos to try in a Next Fest, so sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have a helping hand in working out what&#x27;s worth sinking your time into. Below, we&#x27;ve rounded up 16 of our favourites so far, and we&#x27;ll be writing about plenty more demos we&#x27;ve yet to try over the coming week.

                              <span>It takes a particular type of farming game to really hook me in these days, but Lightyear Frontier&#x27;s crop-planting mechs might just be the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for. Everything I&#x27;ve seen of Frame Break&#x27;s futuristic life sim looks delightful so far, and in a recent ID@Xbox showcase, the developers told us a bit more about how it&#x27;s going to operate, and whether those Stardew Valley comparisons are on the money. 
When asked whether players would be able to befriend NPCs like other Stardew-likes, Frame Break&#x27;s CEO Joakim Hedström told us: &quot;In short, yes. We don&#x27;t have a full town like Stardew, but the characters that are there, you&#x27;ll be able to get to know better and learn their stories.&quot;

Today, there&#x27;s another one-day sale on the drive, this time at $104.99 - an incredible value for an SSD of this spec.

This is a great price for this level of performance, with a 10-core and 16-thread design, max turbo frequency of 4.6GHz and of course the same socket 1700 compatibility as other 12th and 13th-gen Intel CPUs. 
Note that to get this price, you&#x27;ll need to use code TND-10 at the checkout - a long-running code that seems to apply to other products as well, FYI.

Original story: A new week means one thing: another update on Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. According to a report from The New York Times, Microsoft is expecting the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to oppose the deal, after EU regulators issued their own antitrust warnings last week. Microsoft reportedly believes it can convince EU and UK regulators to accept their concessions and eventually approve the acquisition.

As I&#x27;ve said before, a lot of them can&#x27;t quite match the OG for all manner of reasons, but Spellbook Demonslayers is different. Despite only being in early access, it&#x27;s already got a solid foundation to work from. No, there isn&#x27;t an Old Testament that whirls around your person like a holy sawblade, but there is a revolving shield with a pistol glued onto it. Yeah, I thought that would convince you.

                              <span>Wishfully&#x27;s upcoming cinematic platformer Planet Of Lana turned eyes and heads when it was first announced at E3 2021, and the comparison we instantly settled upon was &quot;like Ori meets Inside&quot;. At a recent ID@Xbox showcase we attended last week, creative director and Wishfully co-founder Adam Stjärnljus acknowledged that Playdead connection, saying that both Limbo and Inside &quot;had a huge impact on me&quot;. But he also said Studio Ghibli&#x27;s animated film Spirited Away was another key influence, which, yep, that definitely tracks. 
&quot;I was very inspired by Studio Ghibli films, and especially the film Spirited Away,&quot; Stjärnljus told us. &quot;That&#x27;s been kind of like a guiding star from the beginning in terms of tonality with this serious, emotional story, but [also] still, like, a fun quirkiness to it, and really this sense of exploring another world, which we really want.&quot;

                              <span>After two years of early access, the spacefaring looter shooter Everspace 2 is ready to fly into full release for PC on April 6th. Last November, the open-world sequel received its last major update before release, adding in a rift-opening endgame. The game already has grappling hooks - which automatically makes every shooter better - so, now we’re just waiting for a few extra bits before it’s ready for takeoff.

                              <span>The RPS Time Capsule returns for its first outing of 2023, and this time we&#x27;re casting our minds back to the hallowed year of 2006. Little did we know it at the time, but this is the year we start to see the birth of certain game series that are still alive and kicking today (just about), as well as the nascent beginnings of now beloved studios honing their craft on some of their very first titles. But which of those games have earned themselves a spot in the eternal RPS Time Capsule? Come and find out which ones have stood the test of time, and which, after reading this article, have been consigned to the smog-filled trashfire of future Earth.

This week, my eye has been caught by a walking witch hut, using a shotgun to rocket-jump, some Dark Messiah-style kicking baddies into spikes, and unusual animal encounters. Come see!

                              <span>I hesitate to call Potion Tales a shop sim or retail management game, because the economics of running a figuratively and literally underground magic potion shop seems a secondary concern next to making the potions and deciding whether you want to screw people over or not. If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.
In practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you&#x27;re approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That&#x27;s all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.

Starting today until next Friday, February 17th, it&#x27;s Magic Week here at RPS, where we aim to highlight all manner of fabulous games about magic, witches, wizards, general sorcery and other spell-adjacent tomfoolery. We&#x27;re also putting special emphasis on magic games made by trans developers, too. Join us for a glimpse of what&#x27;s coming up.

Prohlížeč je z velké části napsaný v Rustu a vykresluje i grafiku, i když s rozlišením, jaký terminál dovolí. Je celkem rychlý a přehrajete v něm video na YouTube nebo si zahrajete Doom.</span>

                              <span>Jako každý měsíc je zde Virtuální Bastlírna s novinkami ze světa bastlení, elektroniky, vědy a techniky. Tento měsíc se navíc opravdu urodilo. Co si tedy bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili?

Ze světa software například zajímavá betaverze LTSpice 17.1, která umí počítat charakteristiku spínaných zdrojů z tranzientní simulace. Zároveň je tu první release candidate KiCADu 7 a brzy by měla být plnohodnotná verze 7. Nebo třeba aplikace, kterou můžete vyfotit klíč a jednoduše vytvořit výkres pro klíč, aby šel vyrobit duplikát. Vědci otestovali, jak pomocí sady ESP32 mapovat nejen počet osob v místnosti, ale i jak se zrovna pohybují a co dělají. ST Microelectronics má zase nový nástroj pro vývoj machine learning aplikací.

Novinky jsou ale i ze světa hardware. ST Microelectronics má nové řady procesorů C0 a U5. Renesas zase uvádí na trh řadu nových malých FPGA s předpokládanou cenou $0.5/kus. Česká společnost vyvíjející unikátní kryptočipy má už první vzorky pro testování.

I ze světa bastlení se však najdou novinky. Kupříkladu detekce chemických sloučenin pomocí odezvy na vysokofrekvenční pole, doporučení, jak dělat spolehlivě zapájitelné footprinty 0402 a 0201 součástek nebo jak se dělá plošný spoj, který se umí sám zapájet.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. února od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

                              <span>What happened, Miss Williams?
It&#x27;s a good time to be a fan of fighting games and a good day for those who love their sexy silent assassins. Nina Willaims, star of Death by Degrees and also a Tekken mainstay, got her first solo trailer for the upcoming release of Tekken 8. Nina, sister of fellow fighter Anna Williams, sports an unforgettable look this time around, and I honestly can&#x27;t take my eyes off of her. The last Tekken game that I played was Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for the Wii U and she was definitely one of my most played characters. Given her history with the series, I don&#x27;t think there was ever a danger of Nina not appearing in Tekken 8, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to get her confirmed.

The reveal of Nina Williams for Tekken 8 follows previous trailers for the upcoming fighter that have confirmed other returning favorites. Other fighters set to appear in this highly anticipated sequel include:
Marshall Law
Paul Phoenix
King
Lars Alexandersson
Jin Kazama
Devil Jin
Jun Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
Jack-8
Nina&#x27;s trailer was just one of a few notable pieces of Tekken news today. To ready players for Tekken 8, Executive Director Katsuhiro Harada and Director Kohei Ikeda presented an in-depth look at some of the new systems that&#x27;ll be introduced in the game, including the new Rage System and a detailed look at the Heat System that was previously announced. The video, posted below, also confirms Tekken 8 will include an optional simplified control scheme that combines the Easy Combo and Assist features from Tekken 7. Bandai Namco also confirmed the Tekken World Tour 2023 would return this year with Tekken 7 and the entire tournament would be fully offline.

Tekken 8 is still without a set release date, but when the game does arrive, you&#x27;ll be able to pick it up for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.

Games and consoles have lasted for around five decades, and you know what has been with them all this time? Gaming accessories. Many of these devices, like motion controllers and link cables, opened up new gaming opportunities that weren&#x27;t available before. Others, like the Power Glove or the Sega Activator, were merely expensive novelties. But some of the best gaming accessories make memorable experiences for everyone, and here are 10 of them for you to consider.
10. Game Shark or Action Replay

And just like that, it&#x27;s February. Welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? friends, and you join me on the cusp of starting an actual &quot;week off&quot;, a system wherein you &quot;don&#x27;t go to work&quot; for a little bit, and it&#x27;s apparently &quot;fine&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine this working out at all, but I&#x27;m always willing to try trendy new ideas.
Of course, even when I&#x27;m off work, you can still find me right here this fine Saturday, joining you all for another round of well-wishes, work exorcism, and the welcoming of what I hope will be a brighter month for you, me, all of us. So, before I start sitting on my sofa, staring blankly at the walls, twiddling my thumbs, and hopefully not opening Slack, let&#x27;s get this week&#x27;s edition of Whatcha Been Playing underway.

It’s hard to believe that Backbone was a year and a half ago. My memories of it are suitably hazy outside some key scenes, but I remember the visual appeal, its interesting setting, and the fact that its narrative came so damned close to being satisfying and just falls slightly short. The important thing is I wanted more, so I was excited when Eggnut announced their next game would continue the series.
Tails: The Backbone Preludes is exactly that: a set of four short stories that flesh out Backbone’s characters. While it gives more context to what goes on in the narrative of Backbone, what I feel is more important about it is it’s another excuse to descend into the discomforting, roiling pot of pitch-noir narrative that the series is going for.

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario&#x27;s appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong&#x27;s reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
In this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser&#x27;s Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad&#x27;s wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario&#x27;s video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.
To this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7. For more, check out our reaction to the last full trailer during a recent episode of All Things Nintendo.</span>

The developer will no longer ban just cheaters themselves—though it boasts already wiping out “over 50,000 accounts that we found to be cheating since the launch of Overwatch 2”—but also anyone that…

I, Marcus Stewart, and video editor Alex Van Aken played this chapter at Capcom’s headquarters for our cover story. You&#x27;ll get a great look at the section we played as well as our commentary for added context. The footage includes extended looks at the church and cemetery sequences, a demonstration of combat and exploration, capping off with a larger slice of the chaotic cabin battle with Luis Serra.

                              <span>Since the remake of Resident Evil 4 graces Game Informer’s cover this month, we thought it’d be fitting to revisit the game that kicked off Capcom’s remake craze: Resident Evil 2. 
Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.

                              <span>The PC launch of The Last of Us Part I has been delayed by a few weeks. Instead of releasing on March 3, the game now arrives on March 28.
Naughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
The Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far. The show’s second season has already been confirmed.

The studio announced in February of last year that Knockout City was going free-to-play and saying goodbye to Electronic Arts, who originally published the game as an EA Originals title, to self-publish the game&#x27;s future content. That free-to-play launch happened last June with the start of Season 6 and now, Velan has announced that it will shut the game down in June of this year. More specifically, Knockout City will be shutdown on June 6.

Yout seeks a declaration that it doesn&#x27;t violate the DMCA and accuses the music industry group of defamation and business disparagement.

                              <span>When Duke Nukem 3D burst onto the FPS scene in the Nineties, young CJ was a bit confused. This Duke wasn&#x27;t the purple-shirted acrobat I&#x27;d known from Apogee Software&#x27;s pair of platformers earlier that decade. He was brash, crude, and and didn&#x27;t side-scroll anymore. It wasn&#x27;t for me, so I moved on to other games. I still occasionally loaded up those earlier platformers though, wistfully remembering a time when Duke presumably used actual toilets when he needed to answer a call of nature.

                              <span>Gather round, children, and I’ll tell you of something magical: the NZXT Source 340 compact mid-tower PC case with side window, product code CA-S340W-B1. Good gravy, did I love that case. Tightly proportioned without being too cramped for a full-size graphics card, maturely designed without looking dull, and hewn from some of most gorgeously textured matte steel I’ve seen on a piece of computing hardware. Don’t even get me started on the upgraded Source 340 Elite. It’s been years since these cases disappeared from sale and ascended to Component Heaven, and although it’s taken a few tries, there’s finally a new chassis that’s worthy of the legacy: the NZXT H5 Flow.

                              <span>Hello folks. Earlier this week, we unveiled some of the cool things coming up for RPS this year - many of which revolve around you, our lovely readers and supporters. If you haven&#x27;t had a chance to check that post out yet, I&#x27;d love to hear what you think of it. And yes, fixing our comments nesting is still very much on the agenda as well. Our tech team have a lot of websites to take care of these days, and they&#x27;re working as fast as they can to sort things out. As soon as I have an update I can share, I&#x27;ll let you know. 
But enough about techy bits. I wanted to use this Letter From The Editor to talk about some of the more supporter-oriented things mentioned in that &#x27;What&#x27;s coming up&#x27; post. Specifically, I want to kick off the inaugural Ask RPS - your chance to ask us, the editorial team, questions about games, the site, the way we do things, and other things we like.

Navarro’s series Midnight Scenes has been the highlight, having disturbing premises and Twilight Zone creepiness. The newest episode, Midnight Scenes: From The Woods is due on February 9th and it looks as chilling as ever.

                              <span>I really do not play enough visual novels these days. Raptor Boyfriend has been sat on my hard drive for at least a year, and it won&#x27;t be the last. Historically, I have fallen hard for two kinds of VN: emotionally probing character dramas like Eliza and Watch Me Jump, or gentle and slightly silly comedies like Laura Silver and Camp W. The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone&#x27;s-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.

Raptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.

Then, during my first week back at work, vid bud Liam told me to try Age Of Empires II. Never before has a New Year’s Resolution been abandoned so fast. I really wanted to stick with it. Promise.
But! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II&#x27;s low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s third season is right around the corner and, as always, that means we’re getting a new map. Blizzard have treated us to our first look at the Antarctic Peninsula, an icy-themed control map launching alongside Season 3 on February 7th. The Antarctic Peninsula is a big deal since it’ll delve into Mei’s backstory, it’s the first natural environment in an OW map, and it lets you fish. As in catching fish. At an ice hole. As in, you can catch fish at an ice hole in Overwatch 2.

                              <span>The last few weeks have been messy for The Day Before, the survival MMO that was Steam’s most wishlisted game for much of 2022. Last month, The Day Before’s Steam page was quietly removed from the storefront following a trademark dispute. Developer Fntastic also delayed the game from March 1st to November 10th at the same time, just days before they promised to show some raw gameplay footage of it in action. The whole debacle led to accusations on Reddit and Discord that the game didn’t even exist, but at long last, that promised gameplay video has arrived. And... it’s merely fine.

It&#x27;s also getting a Steam Next Fest demo next week on February 6th, which gives you access to its chunky tutorial and the early portion of its campaign, plus the Historic Battle of The Battle Of Passchendaele, which is the mission I got a chance to play at the end of last year. As it turns out, I&#x27;ve also had a sneak peek at the Next Fest build, too, and there&#x27;s a heck of a lot to sink your teeth into. Here&#x27;s a small glimpse of what to expect.

                              <span>Fishing mini-games make just about any game better. There’s something meditative about being close to the water, waiting in silence for a catch, and mashing buttons to reel them in - plus I don’t need to deal with the horrendous smell from behind the safety of my desk. The indie game Dredge subverts what I like about fishing games, with an eerie eldritch horror waiting beneath the ocean’s surface. We won’t need to wait long before we see what&#x27;s under there as Dredge releases on March 30th.

I gave the patch a whirl to try out its PC-specific changes – namely a new &#x27;Performance&#x27; setting for RT global illumination and a fix for the broken screen space reflections setting – only to find that non-ray-traced, DirectX 12 performance has been utterly knackered.

                              <span>I tend to find that a lot of rhythm games hold back from going completely beast mode. It definitely comes from a place of accessibility, where an onslaught of timed bars and coloured symbols can be intimidating for casual players. But what about the rest of us who want to be pummelled to death in time with a catchy beat?
Good news! TinyBuild&#x27;s new action-adventure game Rhythm Sprout: Sick Beats &amp; Bad Sweets does not hold back. I&#x27;m not even halfway through the game and I’ve had my butt completely kicked by its barrage of oncoming beats, and all in perfect time to its soda-pop EDM.

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

Now, these CPUs - and their accompanying motherboards and RAM - are starting to become more affordable, with the high-end Ryzen 7 7700X dropping from a launch price of £440 to just £312 at Amazon UK as of today.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s S2721DGFA is one of the best 1440p gaming monitors on the market thanks to its use of an LG Fast IPS panel, blending the plus points of both TN and IPS displays. Normally this monitor costs north of £300, but today it&#x27;s down to £279 at Dell UK, a great price that can be dropped further to £251 if you have a student or Dell Advantage employee account.

Now the latest earnings report from Bay 12 Games is here to put an exact dollar figure on that success. Here&#x27;s a tease: revenue in January was up over 462x since December.

                              <span>It&#x27;s great that games are now regularly updated post-release, but it&#x27;s also common for me to long for those halcyon days when I first fell in love with a game. It&#x27;s good news then that Deep Rock Galactic is celebrating its fifth anniversary by making it possible to play it exactly as it was at release in early 2018.

Of course, that&#x27;s just one way they&#x27;re celebrating the milestone, alongside an anniversary event and new DLC.

The best thing about it, as is so often the case with 4X and grand strategy games, is the very beginning. That opening half-hour of limitless potential and giddy curiosity is utterly spellbinding. I don&#x27;t know if any strategy game does it better.

                              <span>Can I tell you a secret? I&#x27;m terrible at Battle Brothers. I&#x27;m still terrible at Battle Brothers, even after playing it on and off for a few years. It&#x27;s a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it&#x27;s all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.
But since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it&#x27;s about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It&#x27;s long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That&#x27;s partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow &quot;do and be everything&quot; approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.

                              <span>Capcom’s monstrously big Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is receiving its fourth free title update on February 7th. Sunbreak’s latest update adds new Event Quests, Anomaly Research content, paid DLC, and two new Elder Dragons to hunt. I don’t think any of these additions are as exciting as the giant Sweetcorn weapon introduced last year, but I digress.

                              <span>The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns in 2023 with a new friend and a new format. We ran out of themes, so we&#x27;re going to flip to a magazine-ish show, where we discuss some current events as well as the games we&#x27;ve been playing. This week we talk about games on film, with everyone bloody loving The Last Of Us TV show and reports that Lara Croft will be hitting the small screen too. We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real. Plus: &quot;try cutting off their limbs&quot;; what is Forspoken, and why so graphics?

                              <span>Little fluffy stuffed friends exert a strange and unknowable power over me. These days we only occasionally get offered free stuff as part of our jobs, because we are not YouTubers or Twitch streamers. When I first started websites would get sent a lot of stuff -  you know, statuettes and toys and doodads. I don&#x27;t like these things, and I always wished PRs sent me cake instead. Neither thing would make me like the game more, but at least I can eat cake, and the same cannot be said for a figurine of some kind of big-titted space samurai holding a sword.
I have, however, discovered that plushies of game characters I like are an exception to this.

                              <span>With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN&#x27;s Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn&#x27;t all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon&#x27;s Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn&#x27;t actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. 

This time, though, you&#x27;re right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home?

Spirited Thief allows you to play out that fantasy in a series of top-down, turn-based, stealthy heists. Better yet, it’s sneaking onto PC this summer and has a demo available now.

It&#x27;s called Stereogram, because it&#x27;s made of moving stereograms. Let your eyes go slack and gaze into the distance of an optical illusion as you jump around pretty little Magic Eye levels in this platformer which reminds me of VVVVVV.

Like Simogo&#x27;s surreal thriller, most of Delete After Reading plays out like you&#x27;re reading a novel, where scrolling through paragraphs of text will reveal images, clues and puzzles you can interact with. As the devs put it, Delete After Reading is a “game you can read, and a book you can play,” and looks and sounds really quite rad. Even better, it’s releasing on March 14th.

                              <span>Okay, we all agree that the ocean is kind screwed up right? Like, we’ve all seen that YouTube video showing how deep the sea is and unanimously agree that it’s, like, terrifying? As much as I love relaxing subaquatic city builders and exploring underwater alien worlds, I want games about stuff in the sea that makes my skin crawl to think about. Enter Full Fathom.
So, Full Fathom isn’t out yet, or even has an official release date, but I just love the idea and look of this game. Being developed by Daemon House, this is an oceanic survival horror where you’re trapped in a derelict submarine that has sunken to the depths of an abyssal sea. You need to navigate your surroundings and keep the sub up and running to make your way back to civilisation, aka a rusty tin can is your last lifeline.

                              <span>Last night was a restless one for the Steam Deck. In addition to a huge client update for the handheld PC, Valve pushed out a Proton Experimental update to fix a crashing problem with games that use the Ubisoft Connect launcher on Steam. 
Ubi’s launcher had received an update of its own, sadly one that interfered with the ability of Proton – the layer of software that helps made-for-Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS – to keep it compatible with the Deck. Indeed, just like the 2K Launcher last year, with the added irony that the affected games (which include The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion and Ghost Recon Breakpoint) only arrived on Steam in the past few weeks.

                              <span>Fans have been clamouring for a sequel to Titanfall 2 since its release in 2016, but it looks like we might need to put those hopes on hold for a little longer. According to a report from Bloomberg, EA have cancelled an unannounced project codenamed Titanfall Legends, a single-player mash-up between Titanfall and Apex Legends - Respawn’s battle royale, set in the same universe. Around 50 devs were working on the game before its cancellation earlier this week. EA are reportedly trying to find other positions for the devs, but those that aren&#x27;t rehired are being laid off with severance.

                              <span>Sometimes I want to describe games in the most high-brow way possible. I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.
Hi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo&#x27;s supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. 
Hi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush&#x27;s soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum.

You&#x27;ll learn about scrapped redesigns for the iconic chainsaw villager, how normalcy breeds horror, and how Nakaoka and the team created a new cow-headed, hammer-wielding villager referred to as The Brute.

She’s been kidnapped by a mysterious cult and held captive in a rural Spanish village players must search and survive in. Once you find Ashley, you become both her protector and, sometimes, partner. Her mechanics and interactions with Leon have some big changes, so as part of our larger cover story, I asked directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi to explain their reasons for making them. 
By clicking the right analog stick, Leon can tell Ashley to keep close (yelling &quot;come on!&quot;) or to maintain some distance (&quot;spread out&quot;). You can no longer command her to stop; she follows no matter what. That means no more ditching her in a safe spot to clear out enemies lying ahead like in the original R…</span>

WWE 2K22 relaunched the franchise on the right foot, and 2K23 aims to build upon that success. The improvements and additions from last year’s game remain intact and expanded in some cases. The legendary John Cena gives his blessing of sorts by gracing the game&#x27;s cover and starring in the centerpiece Showcase mode. That’s all well and good, but the addition of the long-requested WarGames match may be 2K23’s most exciting bullet point.

                              <span>Electronic Arts has reportedly canceled a single-player game set in the shared Apex Legends and Titanfall universe. 
This news comes by way of Bloomberg, which reports that three people familiar with the matter say EA canceled the project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, that was in development at Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment. Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. 


The publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. 
It&#x27;s likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an &quot;Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.&quot;
Word of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter&#x27;s developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn&#x27;s upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. 
The company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It&#x27;s important to note this isn&#x27;t a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it&#x27;s likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. 
PlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console&#x27;s big holiday release. 


Including both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. 
PlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2&#x27;s 45.4 million but down from Q1&#x27;s 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5&#x27;s lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.
In terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That&#x27;s up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. 
All told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5&#x27;s best quarter yet.

Čtvrtletní odměny, roční odměny, snížení dorovnání příspěvku na penzijní připojištění na polovinu z 5 % na 2,5 %, pozastavení zvyšování platů a snížení základních platů – to vše podle interní komunikace probíhá.</span>

                              <span>Sony is closing the PlayStation Plus Collection, the batch of PS4 essentials that PS Plus subscribers on PS5 could download and play for no extra charge. 
In an email sent to subscribers, the message states that on May 9, the 19-game collection will disappear, and subscribers have until that date to add its games to their game library. Sony didn&#x27;t provide a reason for why it&#x27;s closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:
The PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox&#x27;s Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: 
Batman: Arkham Knight
Battlefield 1
Bloodborne
Call of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition
Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy
Days Gone
Detroit: Become Human
Fallout 4
Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition
God of War (2018)
Infamous: Second Son
The Last Guardian
The Last of Us Remastered
Monster Hunter: World
Mortal Kombat X
Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)
Resident Evil VII: Biohazard
Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End
Until Dawn
Last year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven&#x27;t already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.</span>

Hi-Fi Rush occupies an increasingly rare space in the big-budget video game industry: that of colorful, goofy, and light-hearted titles. For its 10 or 11-hour runtime, it has more in common with a Saturday morning cartoon than a thin attempt at gritty, prestige television, like most triple-A games these days, and that&#x27;s easily its biggest strength. That its gameplay and combat are a unique melding of rhythm and stylish action games is merely the cherry on top.

                              <span>Amnesia: The Bunker, the next installment in the psychological survival horror franchise, arrives on May 16 instead of its original March window. 
The Bunker offers a different spin on the Amnesia formula. Set during World War 1, players control a French soldier who gets separated from his comrades and trapped inside a military bunker. Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares. Check out the original reveal trailer below.


You can check out Amnesia: The Bunker on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

These are the four games all PlayStation Plus subscribers can add to their libraries starting next week on February 7, not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus games catalog that varies depending on the tier of subscription you have. 
Here&#x27;s what PlayStation has to say about each of these games:
Evil Dead: The Game | PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4
Game Informer&#x27;s Evil Dead: The Game review
OlliOlli World
Game Informer&#x27;s OlliOlli World review
Destiny 2: Beyond Light

Mafia: Definitive Edition

All four of these games will be available to PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium members from February 7 until March 6. You have until February 6 to add last month&#x27;s games – Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Fallout 76, and Axiom Verge 2 – to your library. 
Elsewhere in today&#x27;s announcement, PlayStation announced that the PlayStation Plus Collection, which PS5 owners subscribed to Plus have had access to since 2020, will no longer be offered starting May 9. 
&quot;If you haven&#x27;t redeemed the titles in this collection yet, you can still do so until May 9, which will enable you to access those titles even after this date for as long as you remain a PlayStation Plus member.&quot;

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is finally out next week, after multiple delays that pushed it out of its original 2021 release date to 2023. And you can prepare the game&#x27;s release with a new gameplay launch trailer released by developer Avalanche Software today. 
The trailer features roughly two and a half minutes of new Hogwarts Legacy footage, including a mix of both cinematics from the game and gameplay. We see Hogsmeade, professors, students, and plenty of Hogwarts, of course. 
Check it out for yourself in the Hogwarts Legacy launch trailer below: 


&quot;Hogwarts Legacy invites players to embark on an epic journey as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts, gifted with a rare ability to tap into ancient, powerful magic,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Guided by the Wizard&#x27;s Field Guide and unique instruction from professors and other characters, fans will uncover a compelling storyline filled with thrilling challenges and mysteries.&quot;
For more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month ,and then watch this cinematic tour of the Hogwarts castle grounds. Check out Hogwarts Legacy&#x27;s PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that.
Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game), and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. 
Hogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10, and PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4. The Switch version of the game will be released on July 25.</span>

                              <span>Valiant Hearts: Coming Home, the sequel to 2014&#x27;s Valiant Hearts: The Great War, is now available to play for all Netflix members. 
This Netflix-exclusive game can be played by any subscriber on iOS and Android devices. The sequel brings players back to World War I &quot;for a dramatic narrative game following four interweaving stories of friendship, survival, and sacrifice amidst the turmoil and tragedy of war.&quot; Valiant Hearts: The Great War was a surprise hit back in 2014, garnering attention and storytelling praise from critics and players alike. 
Check out the Valiant Hearts: Coming Home release trailer below: 


&quot;James joins the Harlem Hellfighters to search for his heroic older brother Freddie, while Anna tends to the wounded and broken,&quot; a press release about the game reads. &quot;Ernst, a German driver, and George, a British aviator, each face their own challenges, and Walt, the canine companion from the first game, is back to aid players in their progress through exploration, puzzle-solving, and action sequences.&quot; 
Ubisoft says original core members that worked on Valiant Hearts: The Great War at Ubisoft Montepllier in 2014 have returned to develop Valiant Hearts: Coming Home in collaboration with Old Skull Games.
This is the first of three Ubisoft mobile games coming to Netflix. The next game is Mighty Quest, which is also due out this year and will bring Netflix subscribers a &quot;roguelite-inspired hack-and-slash adventure.&quot; The third game will be an Assassin&#x27;s Creed mobile game to coincide with Netflix&#x27;s live-action Assassin&#x27;s Creed series.

                              <span>Electronic Arts is ending development on both Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile. It is shuttering Battlefield Mobile developer Industrial Toys as well. 
This news was part of EA&#x27;s Fiscal Year 2023 Q3 financial results released yesterday, in which the company revealed that it is also delaying Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to April.
EA says it is ending Battlefield Mobile, which hadn&#x27;t been fully released yet (although many had played through betas), as part of a &quot;pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players.&quot; The company adds that it is hard at work evolving Battlefield 2042, which launched to disappointment from fans, and in &quot;pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe.&quot; 
As for Apex Legends Mobile, EA says that despite the game&#x27;s strong start, &quot;the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations&quot; of its players. 
&quot;At Respawn, we aim to provide players with games that are consistently outstanding,&quot; a statement from Respawn reads. &quot;Following a strong start, the content pipeline for Apex Legends Mobile has begun to fall short of that bar for quality, quantity, and cadence. It is for this reason, after months of working with our development partner, that we have made the mutual decision to sunset our mobile game. Although disappointing, we are proud of the game we launched, are grateful for the support of the Apex Legends community, and are confident that this is the right decision for players.&quot; 
All real-world money, in-app purchases have been disabled and the game has been removed from webstores. From now until the game&#x27;s shutdown on May 1, players can spend their existing Syndicate Gold and continue playing the full game. EA says it will not be providing refunds for money spent on Apex Legends Mobile in its FAQ, which answers other questions you might have here.

                              <span>I&#x27;m running out of pictures to use when I write about Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams because I&#x27;ve only completed two puzzles in it. I&#x27;ve been doing the third one for about a year, because it&#x27;s, I think, six thousand pieces. I say &quot;i think&quot; because it&#x27;s been long enough that I can&#x27;t remember if I told the game to generate it as five or six thousand. But it&#x27;s a lot of thousand.
I really like jigsaws (I am in the middle of doing a real life one that is a big copy of the London Underground map) but, even though I have one of those special mats to do puzzles on so you can fold them away, they&#x27;re quite inconvenient. At the same time, though, there are very few digi-jigsaws that capture the kind of tactile experience of sifting and sorting through pieces. Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams really does, though.

                              <span>Revisiting Minecraft to discuss whether it deserved the GOTY award back in 2010 is a hard task, in the same way that discussing the importance of sliced bread is hard. It’s so significant that, when ranking the significance of other similar things, we all forget it until someone goes “wait wot about Minecraft” and then everyone unleashes a collective “oooo yeahhh”, guaranteeing it the top spot. To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.
In fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword. I’ll give it a fair go so that Alice can’t say I didn’t try, and swiftly move on to reading all of your (hopefully) lovely comments about why you also like Minecraft. If everyone brings one thing, we can have a show-and-tell.

                              <span>Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there&#x27;s some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone.

                              <span>I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.
Pentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati&#x27;s vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati&#x27;s humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.

                              <span>As someone who considers Uniqlo an extravagance, the HTC Vive XR Elite might just be the most expensive thing I’ll ever wear. Revealed at CES 2023 and set for launch in March, this is the first Vive VR headset in years with real PC gaming credentials, while borrowing from the more compact design of the mobile VR-minded Vive Flow VR glasses. I recently went to try them out over here in London, with an uneasy thought in my mind: even with a lighter design than the Vive Cosmos series, how could this possibly be worth £1299 / $1099?

Instead of focusing on one theme and yapping on about it for a very long time, we&#x27;re now splitting the pod into two segments: the first half on the hip and happening, the second on an FPS genre or subgenre that we&#x27;re unfamiliar with. Our first port of call? theHunter: Call Of The Wild.
In our first sessions with the game, we both concluded that A) deer are incredibly athletic; and B) we&#x27;re the most impatient people, perhaps ever. More than that, though, we hadn&#x27;t realised how important it was to fixate on your prey. Not like, track them down. But like, track them down, you know?

                              <span>A Bloomberg report from yesterday has revealed new details on the state of the Halo franchise and the turmoil at developer 343 Industries. This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days&#x27; notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development.

                              <span>Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.
“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”


When the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release.

Live services will go offline on February 28th at 4PM GMT/10AM CST/11AM ET. In a blog post from the team, Iron Galaxy shared that Season Two will be Rumbleverse’s last, but it should be receiving one final update soon to remove the game&#x27;s monetisation. This continues the trend of me discovering a new battle royale game, thanks to the announcement of its death.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played Shiny Shoe&#x27;s upcoming roguelike Inkbound once before, and not only is it markedly different to their previous game Monster Train, but it also featured the snappiest turn-based combat I&#x27;d seen. With that in mind, I dove into the game&#x27;s recent technical test with fellow RPS Treehouse-dwellers Ollie and James to sample the game at a more leisurely pace, and to draw upon their greater strategic expertise. Did the combat hold up? Were they pleased to be dragged into a co-op session with me? Yes... and no. We had fun, but it didn&#x27;t come quite as naturally without the guiding hand of the developers showing us the ropes.

In a series of Twitter posts, Activision announced a new, free-to-play “small map” called Ashika Island. Warzone’s new map will feature a brand new mode DMZ, alongside the returning mode Resurgence - a slimmer BR that cuts the lobby size down from 150 to 50 players, and enables respawns. Ashika Island and the new modes will launch alongside Season 02 on February 15th.

                              <span>The Sims 4 didn&#x27;t have toddlers until they were added in 2017, and sims&#x27; early years will continue to telescope when March comes around. That&#x27;s when infants will finally be added to the game, turning babies into full sims.

The latest update also offered news on Project Rene, the eventual successor to The Sims 4. The key takeaways: it&#x27;s not an MMO but it will have multiplayer as well as singleplayer, and it&#x27;s years away from release.

In a statement released on Twitter, developers Respawn Entertainment said that the action-adventure sequel would no longer meet its March 17th release date and will instead draw laser swords on April 28th.

If those two games were to come together in a high speed collision, the mangled wreckage might look like The Crew Motorfest, Ubisoft&#x27;s newly announced game about a racing festival on the island of O&#x27;ahu. The reveal trailer is below.

                              <span>Marvel Snap is several rare things at once: a licensed superhero game that&#x27;s fun; a card game that&#x27;s graspable and allows for casual play; and a free-to-play game that doesn&#x27;t feel warped by microtransations.

As of today, it now has a PvP battle mode to enable friends to pit their decks against one another. It&#x27;s either making a good thing better, or it&#x27;s the beginning of the end of all the things I mentioned above.

                              <span>Portable SSDs are jolly useful for quickly transferring large files, like Steam game file backups or 4K videos, from device to device. I&#x27;ve said before in similar blogs that I use one to ferry videos from my computer downstairs to my TV, but I also rely on one to quickly set up a PC for performance testing and copy game files to my Steam Deck. 
In any case, you&#x27;d normally expect to pay anywhere from £70 to £100 for a 1TB drive of a decent spec, but today you can pick up Integral&#x27;s 1TB USB-C Portable SSD for £59.99 at MyMemory. To get this price, you&#x27;ll need to use code HMMJSU at the checkout.

                              <span>Sony&#x27;s WH-1000XM line of noise-cancelling headphones is brilliant - I&#x27;ve used a pair of XM4s while working for years - and they&#x27;re actually pretty decent for PC gaming too, especially if you&#x27;re in a louder environment. That&#x27;s why I thought I should tell you that these WH-1000XM5s are discounted to £249 on Sony&#x27;s UK site when you use code UPGRADE50 to knock £50 off the price. This is the first time they&#x27;ve dropped to this level, and for a go-anywhere set of headphones they might just be worth a look.

                              <span>Dead Space’s remake treatment has produced a piece of gory greatness, some Steam Deck wobbles notwithstanding. Vid bud Liam touched on the visual upgrades in his review, but since it’s been shaking my bones even harder than the original did, I wanted to dive even deeper into the mottled flesh of the modernised Dead Space to examine how all those new polygons and effects aren’t just there to please nerds. They do, in fact, make the remake scarier.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come to regard the four main games in the Life Is Strange franchise as kind of like the siblings in a big family. There&#x27;s the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she&#x27;s the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she&#x27;s more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there&#x27;s the youngest, who&#x27;s extremely likeable, in large part because she&#x27;s learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she&#x27;s modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn&#x27;t really forged her own identity.
Then there&#x27;s Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he&#x27;s just a bit gawky. He&#x27;s experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it&#x27;s only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.

                              <span>Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It&#x27;s the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s &quot;words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,&quot; and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.

                              <span>The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.


12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We&#x27;ve been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.

                              <span>Whomst among us hasn&#x27;t dreamt of somehow being transported to a magical world, where there are talking unicorns, and you can throw lightning and control plants because you are this universe&#x27;s very special hero? Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I&#x27;d be a bit disappointed. It&#x27;s all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn&#x27;t much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.
Forspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it&#x27;s over; I didn&#x27;t pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I&#x27;d be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn&#x27;t happen much, and isn&#x27;t contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you&#x27;ve seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.

The studio behind Flame In The Flood were acquired by CD Projekt Red back in 2021, and CDPR first mentioned Sirius in an investor call last October. The project was initially described as &quot;an innovative take on The Witcher universe telling an unforgettable story.” We now know that this “unforgettable story” could potentially be told inside of a multiplayer game, or at least a game with multiplayer and social elements.

You’ll need to wait a little longer to help Cloud and friends clean up the city, as we don’t have a release date for the free Midgar Special Request DLC yet. The crossover pack’s announcement (via the Square Enix Extreme Edges Twitter account) did tease a few of the things we can expect to clean up, including the Seventh Heaven bar, and FF7’s first boss the Guard Scorpion. The teaser image also shows off the motorcycles from FF7’s mini-game, so I’ll be expecting to hose that down in time for a quick escape.

I think there&#x27;s probably some sort of law against wishing people a Happy New Year when you&#x27;re saying it on the final day of January, but stuff it, I&#x27;m doing it anyway. Happy New Year everyone. Let&#x27;s talk about all the cool stuff coming up on RPS in 2023.

The company, which is part of the MindGeek imperium, sued the tube site Goodporn for massive copyright infringement. However, Goodporn turned the tables by claiming that it owns the rights to its content, citing a previously signed agreement that MindGeek dismisses as fraudulent.

                              <span>Iron Galaxy’s Rumbleverse, its pro-wrestling-flavored battle royale, is shutting down next month, only seven months after its full launch last August. 
Though Iron Galaxy doesn’t plainly state the reason for Rumbleverse’s demise, a blog post somewhat hints that a lack of substantial players may have played a role, stating in part:
“When you work on a video game, you imagine the community that will show up to play it someday. For years, we dreamed about a lively city filled with people fighting to become a champion. We strived to create a vibrant place that celebrated the competitive spirit. Our goal was to bring joy back to online multiplayer gaming. The people who gave Rumbleverse a chance and took it on as a new hobby have validated every day that we put into bringing our ideas to life.”
Rumbleverse’s online servers shut down on February 28 at 10 a.m. CST. Players who spent any money on or within the game will receive refunds. That includes the Rumbleverse Battle Pass or Brawlla Bills on any platform. The current battle pass will also be given to all players free of charge with double XP gain. Certain emotes and accessories have been made free to acquire as well. Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. 
Rumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. 
In similar news, today Konami announced it&#x27;s turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.</span>

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment has delayed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but thankfully the wait won’t be terribly long. Instead of arriving on March 17, the game will now launch a little over a month later on April 28. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Respawn states the game is content complete, and it&#x27;s solely focusing on fixing bugs, ensuring stability, and polishing the experience as much as possible. The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. For more info on the game, check out our video discussion with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan as well as our most recent preview.</span>

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last year that Guardians of the Galaxy and Peacemaker director James Gunn and Aquaman producer Peter Safran had been hired to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios. Since that reveal, DC fans have speculated what Gunn and Safran&#x27;s new DCU, as the duo is calling the new DC cinematic universe, will look like in the coming years. 
Gunn has teased on Twitter multiple times that he, Safran, and others were formulating their long-spanning plan for the DCU and now, today, the duo has pulled back the curtain on the first 10 projects. All 10 of these projects, which span across movies and TV, will be in Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters.

                              <span>Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.
“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”
Support for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.

Crimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty&#x27;s team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock&#x27;s team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn&#x27;t gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it&#x27;s safe to say that one of Konami&#x27;s &quot;various circumstances&quot; for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.
If you want to try it out, you&#x27;ve got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I&#x27;ve heard Among Us is good.
Do you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>We already knew that 2023 was poised to be a big year for the Street Fighter franchise, thanks in large part to the impending launch of Street Fighter 6 this summer. However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.
Street Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.


&quot;Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,&quot; Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. &quot;We&#x27;re excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.
Pre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.</span>

                              <span>During the 2022 Game Awards, the team behind Dead Cells put out an animated teaser trailer announcing that the game’s next DLC expansion would be Castlevania-themed. It came as a total surprise; Castlevania hasn’t had a new release in years, and most of Dead Cells’ other collaborations never amounted to much more than referential skins and a few weapons. To take such a big leap – and to do it with the series that inspired the game in the first place – is a huge step for the indie roguelike.
While Dead Cells was developed by Motion twin, the Castlevania DLC is being developed by Evil Empire, an indie studio made of ex-Motion Twin employees that have handled most of the game’s post-launch content.

This news comes from a Bloomberg report stating that the switch from Slipspace to Unreal will begin with a new game under the codename Tatanka, according to the publication&#x27;s sources who are familiar with 343&#x27;s plans. According to Bloomberg, 343 is developing Tatanka with Certain Affinity, who has helped develop various Halo games for more than 15 years. The project reportedly started off as a battle royale but has potentially evolved in different directions. 


Bloomberg reports that future Halo games &quot;will also explore using the Unreal Engine,&quot; but that some within the studio are skeptical of dropping Slipspace entirely in favor of Epic Gam…</span>

Following a recent Bloomberg report that stated Sony had told supply partners to prepare for a reduction in display panel orders, alongside word that the company had halved its shipment forecast as a result of disappointing pre-order numbers, Sony has refuted the claim in a new statement to GamesIndustry.biz. 
The publication reports that &quot;PlayStation says it has not cut production numbers for its upcoming VR headset,&quot; touching on Bloomberg&#x27;s report. Playstation told GamesIndustry.biz that it is &quot;seeing enthusiasm from PlayStation fans for the upcoming launch, which includes more than 30 titles such as Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Call of the Mountain, and Resident Evil Village.&quot;

                              <span>In 2005, Resident Evil 4 changed the face of survival horror. The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. 
We visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.
Issue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. 
You can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue. Limited to a numbered print run per issue, this premium version of Game Informer isn&#x27;t available for sale.

A cramped, old, smoky bar in a shopping mall deep beneath a Yokohama train station might not immediately appear conducive to game development, but things are starting to click in my head. Mixed with pounds of nicotine, the air in the bar is communal and light. It&#x27;s also distinct compared to the more modern, formulaic streets immediately above our heads.

                              <span>Marvel Snap has taken the world by storm, but one glaring omission fans have asked for is the ability to battle friends instead of only random strangers. As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.
Battle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.

                              <span>Avatar Generations, a new mobile turn-based squad RPG that&#x27;s free to play on Apple and Android devices, is out today, and you can prepare for the game&#x27;s release with a new launch trailer. 
Developed by Navigator Games and published by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in association with Paramount Consumer Products, Avatar Generations is an RPG that lets players team up with iconic characters from Avatar: The Last Airbender to explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations. It features retold stories from the series and new ones adding to the overall world of Avatar. 
Check it out in the Avatar Generations launch trailer below: 


&quot;In Avatar Generations, players assemble a team of iconic Avatar heroes and adversaries as they explore a dynamic map of the Four Nations,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The game&#x27;s turn-based battles are immersive and strategic, with customizable formations and team combos. The journey not only revisits the most memorable moments from the Avatar universe but also offers new adventures in the Avatar world. Players will relive the classic adventure of Aang and his friends, while battling powerful enemies, upgrading heroes, and mastering the elements to bring balance to the spiritual and physical world.&quot;
Avatar Generations features Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Toph, and others like the Blue Spirit, Princess Yue, Kyoshi Warrior Suki, and more. Each character has their own skills and players can level them up to unlock more and customize them further. You can even equip supports like Momo and Appa to further strengthen your characters. 

Navigator Games will add new characters and companions, additional cosmetics and gear for heroes, and more areas to explore across the Four Nations map in future updates. 
Avatar Generations is out today on iOS and Android devices.

Now, IGN reports it has learned that PlayStation, Xbox, and Sony will be skipping E3 2023, a major blow to what was supposed to be E3&#x27;s big comeback. The publication also reports that these companies won&#x27;t have a presence on the Los Angeles Convention Center showfloor, either, which is where game companies typically have large (and flashy) booths where people can preview games and learn more about what&#x27;s in store.

Theatrhythm Final Fantasy quickly became one of my favorite Nintendo 3DS games when it hit the system in 2012, as did the Curtain Call sequel two years later. These weren’t perfect rhythm games, but they were unique and utilized one of the best compilations of video game scores in music history. The Final Fantasy series is special to me for many reasons, and perhaps chief among those is its music. That I ended up adoring the Theatrhythm series on 3DS was no surprise. I was surprised, though, to see publisher Square Enix and developer indieszero announce Theatrhythm Final Bar Line las…</span>

It&#x27;s got USB-C charging, KVM functionality, FreeSync/G-Sync... and it cost $1499 when it launched two years ago. 
Now, you can pick it up for $729 at Newegg when you use code JAN2548, an outstanding deal for a monitor of this size and quality.

                              <span>The Corsair MP600 Pro is a great high-end PCIe 4.0 SSD, so to get the 1TB model for $155 at Newegg, a reasonable $45 off, is a deal worth writing about. As you&#x27;d hope from a drive of this calibre, this uses more expensive TLC NAND flash and has a DRAM cache, providing noticeably better sustained performance than QLC drives without a DRAM cache.

                              <span>Some developers spend their careers inching towards their dream job, leapfrogging between roles in a grand strategy game of their own making. Others, like Randy Smith, simply show up on their first day and find they’re exactly where they’re meant to be.


“The approach that Looking Glass had to creating games was pretty unique,” he says now. “Even to this day, there are few studios who have that same ideology and mindfulness in how videogames are made.”


Thief: The Dark Project had a great director, in the form of Greg LoPiccolo, who later became a pioneer in the world of music games with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.

                              <span>Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless is coming this fall, and this time it&#x27;s injecting the series’ absurdity with a dose of classical Japanese history. 
This latest installment in the wacky strategy series unfolds in the feudal Japan-style demonic realm of Hinomoto. Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. 


Disgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players&#x27; troops in the new online ranked battles. 
Unlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one. You can get the game on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After weeks of speculation and leaks last year, a Dragon Ball Super collaboration officially went live in Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite, in August. It brought Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and Beerus to the game alongside a Kamehameha mystic item for use in-game and the Nimbus Cloud. Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. 
The official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite&#x27;s battle royale island with &quot;Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super&quot; on it this morning, alongside tomorrow&#x27;s date. This means we&#x27;ll be seeing some (hopefully new) Dragon Ball Super content drop into Fortnite tomorrow.

As for what to expect, that remains unknown. Given the various characters in Dragon Ball Super, it could be anybody. But Dragon Ball mainstays like Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks, and even popular villains like Frieza, didn&#x27;t make an appearance in Fortnite last year, so here&#x27;s hoping we see all or some of them in the Item Shop tomorrow. There&#x27;s also the possibility that we get some Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero content considering that movie hit theaters last August and was quite successful. 
Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because the Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super collaboration begins tomorrow. 
Who do you hope to see added to Fortnite tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>In June 2022, the operators of pirate IPTV service Nitro TV were ordered to pay $100 million in damages to broadcaster DISH Network. To recover at least some of the millions made by the service, DISH obtained permission to seize and sell a house worth almost $1 million. After failing to participate in the original lawsuit, the defendants are now trying to defend their house.

A recent order provides positive news for the rightsholder but that won&#x27;t prevent the defense from being able to use the term &quot;copyright troll&quot; in court.

                              <span>More Director games are ready for public testing!
ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
The first five games by Japanese indie developer iTA-Choco Systems.
