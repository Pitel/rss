My love of gaming came a little bit later in life than most, so there are a ton of well-loved games that I need to catch up on, whether they&#x27;re old classics or recently-released bangers. What&#x27;s nice is that there&#x27;s an endless stream of hits for me to pull from, which means I&#x27;ve been binging titles like Pokémon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Mass Effect over the past few months, just to name a few. For the most part, it&#x27;s been really great to have so many games to play that knock it out of the park — playing the all-time greats all in a row has me reeling over how awesome this medium is.
While I&#x27;ve loved a vast majority of the games I&#x27;ve played recently, there have been one or two that just didn&#x27;t connect with me, which is a shame considering they&#x27;re such well-loved t…</span>

                              <span>Old, but gold?
Back in the early 2000’s, the Dark Alliance subseries of the Baldur’s Gate franchise was created as a means of bringing the Baldur’s Gate experience to console players. Either due to hardware limitations or a simple lack of audience interest at the time, the computer RPG design of traditional Baldur’s Gate wouldn’t work for a console game, so Snowblind decided to go with an action RPG for Dark Alliance. It turned out to be the right decision as audiences loved it, so a sequel was soon greenlit to keep the momentum going. Now that it’s gotten a re-release on modern platforms, how does it compare? Well, Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance 2 is a better game than its predecessor, yes; unfortunately, time hasn’t been too kind to this release.
The plot of Dark Alliance 2 is about as basic as it gets, centering around a villainous vampire who kidnaps the heroes of the first Dark Alliance and terrorizes the region around the city of Baldur’s Gate. You take on the role of a new hero who comes to the city in search of fame and fortune, but your hero eventually gets caught up in the effort to fight back against the vampire and bring peace to the surrounding region.

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

Vampire Survivors contains truly wacky secrets, some of which I&#x27;d never find without the community&#x27;s guiding hand. Even though it&#x27;s fun to catch up to the latest patches, I&#x27;ll admit, certain hidden characters have remained elusive to the point where I&#x27;ve kind of lost hope. Now, with a new unlockable called The Forbidden Scrolls of Morbane, it&#x27;s possible to input cheat codes to open up a bunch of stuff, including the trickiest secret characters.
That&#x27;s right — it&#x27;s Morbane time.
**Spoilers below**
With Vampire Survivors patch 0.10, The Forbidden Scrolls of Morbane relic was added to The Bone Zone, and to stand a chance of finding it, you&#x27;ll want the Milky Way Map.
With the map, you can pause the game…</span>

Activision Blizzard has been a monolith in the gaming industry for nearly fifteen years, best known for titles that have dominated the markets like World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. While its PC games have provided some of the greatest successes over the years, both critically and commercially, the company&#x27;s latest financial report lets on that the tides might be turning in a significant way for the company. During the second quarter of 2022, Activision Blizzard made more than half of its total revenue from mobile games, which is more than PC and consoles combined (thanks, PC Gamer).
While Activision Blizzard brought in $332 million in PC sales, and $376 million in combined console sales, mobile games raked in more than all the other platforms comb…</span>

SNK&#x27;s 2019 release Samurai Shodown is a sharp-ass game — in both literal and metaphorical ways. The cult fighter successfully managed to reinvent itself for modern platforms, while retaining the very deliberate, intense, and high-damage combat style of the Neo Geo classics. Packed with interesting characters and powered by an easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master play style, Samurai Shodown is a unique fighter that deserves to sit within the current zeitgeist.
And it looks like the cult title is getting the opportunity to take a second swing for the gold, as developer SNK has announced that it has teamed with studio Code Mystics for a new update that will implement brand new rollback netcode for the PlayStation, Xbox and PC editions of the period piece scrapper. While SamSho is a fine title from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint, unfortunately, the online element leaves a lot to be desired. While, in 2022, you can still find people fighting the good fight, lag-free action is harder to come by — which is a no go in such a precise, high-damage fighter.

And so, for the dedicated Samurai Shodown community — and fighting game fans in general — the rollback netcode update will be a very welcome addition, along with a sign that SNK has not abandoned the title in favor of some of its more modern releases. In fact, it is believed that the new update should bring online fluidity in alignment with The King of Fighters XV, which has very solid online stability once its fights are underway.
No specific release date was announced for the new update outside of the general window of spring 2023. Samurai Shodown is available now on PS4, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia. Once again, the netcode update is only coming to PlayStation, PC, and Xbox editions of the game.
Evo 2023 is currently underway. You can check out the full schedule right here.

A real piece of gaming royalty joined the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster presented us with one of Bandai Namco&#x27;s most iconic and seminal releases of gaming&#x27;s golden era: Dig Dug, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Developed in 1981 and released to the burgeoning arcade market in 1982, Dig Dug is one of the most recognizable, memorable, and most successful releases of gaming&#x27;s formative era. Players guide an intrepid miner through a series of single-screen underground caverns, digging out tunnels and battling the monsters that dwell within. In a mechanic that just seems so blackly comedic to modern eyes, our hero defeats his opposition by injecting them with a gas line, then inflating their sorry bodies until they literally explode!

Good morning, darling friends of Destructoid, and welcome to Whatcha Been Playing? As always, I hope that the week has been kind to you and yours, and that the weekend brings with it the promise of good rest, good times, and good weather. It is the weekend, Evo weekend at that, and I&#x27;ll be sure to stay semi-tuned into the goings-on in Las Vegas.
New fighting game reveals! What are we going to get? Who are we going to see join the Street Fighter 6 roster? What does Season 2 have in store for Guilty Gear Strive? and are Mileena and Mokap destined to join the roster of MultiVersus? All* of these questions will be answered over the coming 48 hours, spotlit alongside hundreds of digital smackdowns and more than a few instances of &quot;Ok... And now we&#x27;re ready to... Are we?.. Ok... Ok...…</span>

If you&#x27;ve been on pins and needles waiting to find out who would be the final character of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass, you can unclinch and rejoice. During the opening night of Evo 2022, a teaser trailer dropped revealing that Marie will become a playable character. Launching in 2023 for both Skullgirls 2nd Encore and Skullgirls Mobile, Marie&#x27;s arrival on the character select screen comes more than 10 years after Skullgirls first launched on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. She follows Annie of the Stars, Umbrella, and Black Dahlia in joining the cast, the latter of whom is still in alpha.

There is not a whole lot to take from that teaser, but I&#x27;m sure the news is more than enough for those Skullgirls fans who have stuck with the game over the last 10 years. As a casual fighter fan, I have to commend Future Club, Autumn Games, and Hidden Variable for keeping this game and its community going as long as it has. Other developers would have already thrown in the towel and moved on to a sequel.
As for the Skullgirls tournament at Evo 2022, congratulations to SonicFox for bringing home the victory in the Grand Finals against Dekillsage.
Skullgirls 2nd Encore is now available for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. It is scheduled to launch for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S later in 2022. The Season 1 Pass is now available for PC and PlayStation 4. It is expected to release on Nintendo Switch before the end of the year.

                              <span>Buckle up
Welcome back! I have a brief break from last week&#x27;s heat wave and I&#x27;m glad to not feel so on fire all the time. Have you heard of The Mortuary Assistant? I learned about it the other day and scooped it up for us to stream. Guys, this one looks seriously creepy.
Not sure I&#x27;ve played anything this caliber of icky on stream, so buckle in. It also looks like there&#x27;s some classic scary game elements to it, but I don&#x27;t wanna spoil — it&#x27;s not ALL an icky simulator, is what I&#x27;m saying. I think I&#x27;m looking forward to it!

Hopefully it isn&#x27;t too much for our stomachs. See you tonight!
Drop by Destructoid’s Twitch channel at 9:00 p.m. Eastern to hang out.

As if Stray couldn&#x27;t get any better, the game that has cat-lovers and gamers alike fawning over its adorable, fuzzy protagonist is also helping out cats in real life. Streamers and Annapurna Interactive, the game&#x27;s publisher, have facilitated a whole host of events and services to benefit animal shelters and other cat-related charities, as initially reported by AP.
Annapurna reached out to the Nebraska Humane Society ahead of the game&#x27;s launch on July 19 to give them copies of the game to be raffled off as a fundraiser for the shelter. Within a week, they had raised over $7,000 for the cause, including a $1,035 donation from Annapurna themselves. A vast majority of those who donated to the shelter were also new to them, including some…</span>

                              <span>Valve is test-running support for the Joy-Cons
A pair of Nintendo controllers could be joining the list of Steam-supported input devices. In a new Steam client beta, Valve has added support for Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.
The dual-unit controllers are, of course, primarily for the Nintendo Switch. But just in case you&#x27;ve been wanting to use them on your PC, some additional support is currently in the Steam beta.
Valve&#x27;s support allows for the Joy-Cons to be used individually, as mini-gamepads. Or they can be combined into a paired, singular controller. Essentially, the same controller configurations you might mess around with on your Switch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;WniaKJzCNRI
If other Nintendo controllers are more your speed, the Steam client beta also has improved support for Nintendo Online classic controllers. That includes the Nintendo 64, NES, SNES, and Genesis controllers. Support for those classics rolled out last week, but it looks like Valve is improving on the support that&#x27;s already available.
Joyous controller options
It might seem a bit strange of an update, at first. I mean, I have tried to connect Joy-Cons to a PC before, with extremely mixed results. But official support isn&#x27;t just nice for those who don&#x27;t want to pick up extra controllers.
Joy-Cons are a pretty unique style of controller, with built-in sensors and everything. I&#x27;d only be speculating, but I&#x27;m interested to see what modders and other controller tinkerers can do with this.
And more controller support is never a bad thing. I&#x27;m almost tempted to try connecting these to a Steam Deck, if only to enable the bizarre dream of using Switch Joy-Cons on a portable PC.
Whether you&#x27;re just looking for some extra Rocket League controllers or concocting bizarre scenarios, it seems neat. If you want to try it out, you can simply opt into the Steam client beta and test out Joy-Con support for yourself.

                              <span>Say cheese!
To anyone familiar with the recent spate of first-person horror titles, MADiSON will seem instantly familiar. With its moody lighting, tight corridors, and affinity for jump scares, there&#x27;s little here that really sets it apart from the likes of Outlast or Layers of Fear on the surface. Diving into the game a bit deeper, however, unveils some pretty interesting gameplay mechanics, chiefly driven by an item you&#x27;ll be carrying around for the majority of the experience: a polaroid camera.
The camera itself provides multiple functions; some of which are pretty obvious, and others that might not be quite so clear until you start using it properly. Its main use, of course, is to light your way in the darkness. MADiSON is, naturally, a very dark game (although a patch to add in brightness settings proves more than welcome), so there will be multiple instances where you&#x27;ll struggle to see ahead of you without any clear source of light. This is where your camera comes into play: a quick flash of the shutter will instantly reveal your surroundings, if only for the briefest of moments. It&#x27;s a clever way of showing you key items that may otherwise be obscured, but it&#x27;s also an effective way to implement some pretty pant-wettlingly scary jump scares.

If this year wasn&#x27;t already busy enough for the Switch with titles like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, there&#x27;s also Bayonetta&#x27;s next outing to look forward to this October.
If you are eager to learn more about the story of Bayonetta 3, Australia&#x27;s Classification Board has detailed what&#x27;s in store for the Umbra witch. Interestingly, the ACB even notes how this description &quot;may contain spoilers&quot;. There&#x27;ll be strong fantasy, violence and online interactivity (with the game rated MA15+). Here&#x27;s what else to expect:

It&#x27;s been a busy week for Nintendo fans, and for us at Nintendo Life! Not only has Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&#x27;s Wave 2 finally dropped, but Game Freak and The Pokémon Company gave us plenty of news on Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet! Nintendo also delivered its Q1 financial results, where it reported a drop in over sales.
And while some of us really want more Mario Kart DLC tracks like Baby Park, others of us are feeling very enthused by the new Pokémon details. Lastly, we all have a few games on our Switch that are hard to categorise, so why not check out our list of the best games that don&#x27;t really have a genre? Or have multiple genres? They&#x27;re just hard to categorise. Unique, let&#x27;s say.

There have been a lot of brawlers &#x27;inspired&#x27; by Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and the latest one to arrive on the scene is the Warner Bros. title MultiVersus - featuring iconic heroes and cartoon characters like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Bugs Bunny and Tom &amp; Jerry.
The tech experts over at Digital Foundry couldn&#x27;t resist and have decided to do a video comparison to see how this new game holds up against Masahiro Sakurai&#x27;s masterpiece. It&#x27;s already got a tremendous uphill battle on its hands considering how much Smash Bros. has been fine-tuned over the years, but can it actually compete?

Before this new adventure launches later this year, Game Freak and The Pokémon Company will be hosting another limited-time distribution event in their original Switch outing Pokémon Sword and Shield. This one is slightly different compared to recent ones.

If you love being able to sync your Nintendo controllers with new devices and applications, you might be a fan of Valve&#x27;s latest update to Steam. The company responsible for hits such as Half-Life, Team Fortress 2 and the Portal series has revealed it&#x27;s added support for Nintendo&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers in its latest Steam Client beta.
If you&#x27;ve got access to Steam and this particular client, it means you can now sync your Joy-Con and use them as a controller. The patch notes mention how they are supported individually and can also be used in a pair.

                              <span>While a big deal has been made about some former PlayStation exclusives coming to the PC—like Horizon and God of War—no deal was made last week whatsoever about a game with a much lower profile, but which I love regardless.

We can&#x27;t decide if this Backstreet Boys-meets-Ace Attorney combination is brilliant, or horrifying. We think it&#x27;s both, but we also admire the musical skill it takes to think, &quot;you know what would go well together? Boybands and an old DS game about the legal system.&quot; It&#x27;s like the first person to find out that chocolate and crisps is a good combination, even when everyone called them mad.
By combining Maya&#x27;s theme with classic &#x27;90s hit, I Want It That Way, and then casting the four boys — Phoenix, Edgeworth, Apollo and Klavier Gavin — as the band, Chessete has created a masterpiece. It&#x27;s far from their first time doing this very specific kind of mashup, too — check out this Daft Punk one:

                              <span>Celebrating the games that defy genre.
We make a lot of lists here at Nintendo Life, you may have noticed. Why? Because we&#x27;ve all been that person who really wants a game that&#x27;s like another game they really enjoyed, and they want some more recommendations. It&#x27;s easy to lump games together by genre to answer that query — but what about all the games that fall through the cracks?
Some games defy genre in interesting ways, but that makes them hard to put in nice boxes (although maybe putting things in nice boxes isn&#x27;t such a great thing, anyway). Other games mix genres to create something entirely new — like metroidvanias, before &quot;metroidvania&quot; was a thing, or the dreaded deckbuilding roguelike — but that means that they don&#x27;t quite fit in anywhere, either.

POST VOID has finally nabbed a release date. The game is only the second title to be published as part of Super Rare&#x27;s new publishing label, after Grapple Dog earlier this year.
The DOOM inspiration in this vibrant, gory first-person shooter is about as clear as its love of colour, and much like DOOM, POST VOID is all about being fast and violent to get to the end of the procedurally-generated levels.

Sticky balls and sports don&#x27;t go together, especially when it comes to bowling. We&#x27;re trying to bowl the ball and get a strike, not have the ball stuck to us!
Unfortunately, some Nintendo Switch Sports players have been reporting that exact issue. One such player, @MCwreckshin, has tweeted at Nintendo directly about the issues. Apparently, this has only been happening since the recent summer update, and MCwreckshin has compiled footage of all of the times it&#x27;s happened to them.

Mario&#x27;s nipples are, surprisingly, a subject of great debate. Every year, Nintendo has posted a nice, summery render of our plumber boy at the beach, and this year is no different. But when Mario&#x27;s at the beach, and not at work, he trades in his overalls for swimming trunks — and that means this is the only time that we see him topless.
In 2020, Nintendo decided (for whatever reason) to excise poor Mario&#x27;s nips, presumably out of some Nintendo-esque need to PROTECT THE CHILDREN from the horrors of thinking that Mario is mammalian. The internet, not to be outdone, decided that this was weirder than just letting Mario have nipples in the first place, and so in 2021, Nintendo put them back where they belong.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a long way off though.
Developer Nonohara Works has announced Calme, an isometric adventure game that kind of reminds us of the likes of Ni No Kuni and Octopath Traveler in terms of its art direction.
It&#x27;s heading to the Switch, but you better get comfortable, because the game is in the very early stages of development and allegedly won&#x27;t be available until some time after 2024.

We admit it, we&#x27;re suckers for a really nice pre-order bonus. Especially when it comes to figurines. And with Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet coming out this November, we&#x27;re eager to see just what kind of bonuses or gifts will be on offer from various retailers.
So far, we only know about a few digital gifts — such as an exclusive backpack and that cute little Pikachu who&#x27;s Terastral form means he gets balloons! — but Nintendo Wire has discovered that French retailer Micromania-Zing is already ahead of the pack with this lovely physical pre-order bonus.

When you&#x27;re going cave diving, what do you need? A notebook? We&#x27;re not sure about that! But the upcoming Made in Abyss: Binary Star Falling into Darkness wants you to bring one with you.
Well, not in real life, but there&#x27;s a key mechanic in the action RPG, and it&#x27;s not really for Abyss diving. It&#x27;s for recording details of the people you meet, the creatures you encounter, and the relics you uncover.

                              <span>It’s a grower.
Strange Horticulture takes on some big challenges. It’s a carefully authored story that wants to be driven by interaction, and it’s a single-scene play space that wants to create immersion in a whole world. It’s such a tricky line to walk between structured gameplay that’s interactive but dry and a carefully managed story that limits interaction. But with Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking pulls it off. It creates deep immersion in a well-rounded world while starting from a simple place. The filling-out of the world as we played came from our own discoveries, and we were drawn powerfully into the emerging intrigue of the plot.
In Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking has created a mystery story set in a bizarro-style English Lake District, where real-life place names nestle amid castles, stone circles and religious cults. The player runs an apothecary dealing in specialist plants with medicinal, mind-altering, magical and even mechanical effects. Each day, a series of customers arrive at your counter in need of horticultural help. By cross-referencing what’s on your plant shelf with what’s in your plant-cyclopaedia, you identify the salves, syrups and embrocations that are needed. There’s a loop of learning and labelling plants to receive more plants and more info pages that immediately sucks you in.

                              <span>Scarlet and Violet reportedly fixes a fan favourite Pokémon.
Pokémon fans have, rather expectedly, been quite divided on the upcoming mainline titles Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. While many are embracing the new open-world nature of the games and the apparent freedom it affords players, others are disappointed that the games seem to be a step back after Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
Some fans, however, have noticed a very specific change to one of the creatures showcased in the trailer: Eelektross, the final form of Tynamo introduced in Pokémon Black and White.

Persona 4 Arena fans just got a long-awaited update. Atlus announced today, during Evo 2022, that the rollback netcode update for Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is rolling out today to PlayStation 4 and Steam.
Atlus and developer Arc System Works had announced earlier this year that the Persona 4 Arena Ultimax re-release would be getting rollback. However, it wouldn&#x27;t be in at launch, but arriving as part of a post-launch update.
The date, as it so happens, is today. Evo 2022 just kicked off, and Atlus announced that the update is live for both PS4 and Steam. No mention of Nintendo Switch rollback, however.

Desktop Dungeons, the beloved turn-based roguelike, is coming back with a new style. And while it can be tricky going from a quaint pixel art presentation to a more general modern 3D style (albeit with nice new illustrated character art), the main draw was — and should still be — the puzzle-solving gameplay. Developer QCF Design announced the 3D remake Desktop Dungeons: Rewind for Steam with an estimated Q4 2022 release.

According to the team, &quot;the goal with Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is to bring a game we love to modern devices and modern audiences.

Evo 2022 is officially underway, and Arc System Works took the stage today to discuss Guilty Gear. The company laid out its plans for the near future of Guilty Gear Strive in a roadmap, including new content and a test of some crossplay functionality.
In a panel today, Arc System Works talked a bit about the past of Guilty Gear, leading up to Strive and on to modern day. After answering some questions and sharing some concept art, the team showed off a graphic, detailing what&#x27;s to come for the rest of 2022 and into 2023.
In Summer 2022, a new character and additional character color are planned. Arc System Works is also looking to address some specific platform concerns. For PlayStation 5 players, that means reducing the input delay. And for S…</span>

                              <span>No more rounds of Push until the game&#x27;s out
We&#x27;re just a few months out from the release of Overwatch 2&#x27;s multiplayer component. And while there&#x27;s been some opportunities to test it out, Blizzard is now confirming there won&#x27;t be another Overwatch 2 beta before the game&#x27;s launch.
Blizzard VP Jon Spector took to Twitter yesterday to note that Overwatch 2 was just a few months away. And while players have been anticipating a possible beta happening again, before launch, it sounds like that won&#x27;t be the case.
&quot;While we will continue testing [Overwatch 2] daily internally, we&#x27;re not planning any additional public Beta tests,&quot; Spector writes.

Yes, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 has been freed. Arcade cabinet producer Arcade1Up has revealed a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 arcade cabinet, packing the 3-on-3 fighter and many other Marvel arcade classics into one cab.
The cabinet includes eight games, and has built-in Wi-Fi. So not only is Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 back and playable in its first legit form since the Xbox 360 version, it will also have online play. The cab will also have exclusive side panel art, a matching custom riser, and a light-up marquee.

It&#x27;s not even been a month since we reported that obscure &#x27;00s fighter The Rumble Fish was preparing to make a comeback on modern gaming platforms, and already publisher 3goo is dropping the news that its equally obscure sequel, The Rumble Fish 2, is also in training for a long-awaited return to the ring.
Developed by Dimps and released to Japanese arcades in 2005, The Rumble Fish 2, like its predecessor is a 2D fighter built on the then-popular Atomiswave arcade hardware. Set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic city, devastated and rendered asunder by capitalistic greed, The Rumble Fish 2 welcomes back its cast of colorful characters, while adding six newcomers to the stylish roster. The sequel also introduced new fighting mechanics,…</span>

                              <span>DJ and Pop Star skins
Heroes of the Storm skin ideas were among some of the best in any game — back when the game was at its height. That uh, isn&#x27;t the case anymore, but these concepts from Blizzard senior artist Juyoung Oh really showcase how creative the team could get.
Found on Reddit, these skins are actually a few years old, and were done during a &quot;HOTS Hackathon&quot; (sprint) in 2018, with Oh revealing them two years ago. Oh calls them a &quot;personal project,&quot; but I can easily see these becoming skins in the game&#x27;s heyday.
The skins are DJ Kid Murky, Pop star Li-Ming, and Selfiegenic Stitches. All of them have concept art of various parts of their kit too, and a few are genius. Murky&#x27;s egg (where he hibernates if he dies in battle, only to get resurrected quicker than most MOBA characters) has a router and a cell phone charger on it. Li-Ming is centered around a technological-disco theme, and Stitches even puts a party on for people he eats.
Azmodunk was perhaps the best example of how out-there the Heroes of the Storm skin teams could get. They even recorded real basketball noises just for the skin! 2016 Blizzard: it feels like a different timeline.

                              <span>It&#x27;s to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the series
Assassin&#x27;s Creed has had its ups and downs, and now you can help alleviate the latter a bit with an official...Assassin&#x27;s Creed whiskey?
Crafted by Tennessee Legend, who partnered with Antheum Studios (who in turn partnered with Ubisoft), it&#x27;s a straight bourbon whiskey that&#x27;s priced at $69 per bottle. It&#x27;s expected to arrive in &quot;early September 2022.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the full rundown from the manufacturer:
&quot;Leap into history and celebrate 15 years of working in the dark to serve the light. Antheum Studios and Tennessee Legend Distillery present Assassin’s Creed Straight Bourbon Whiskey. Crafted in the hill country of Texas and finished in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, this 4 year old straight bourbon whiskey carries a rich flavor with rye spice, wheat character, and hints of cherry, vanilla and oak. Appealing to spirit connoisseurs and fans alike, this iconic selection is a worthy addition to any bar. Game hard, drink responsibly.&quot;

Assassin&#x27;s Creed whiskey isn&#x27;t the only drink on the menu: an Assassin&#x27;s Creed Black Flag rum and Valhalla vodka are on the horizon too
If you&#x27;re interested, also in September, Antheum studios is going to be launching both a Black Flag Spiced Rum and a Valhalla vodka. I kinda want to try the former?

Over the next three days, the best of the best, (but not me), will lock horns in some of the greatest fighting games currently on the market.
From Tekken 7 to Street Fighter V, Skullgirls to Granblue Fantasy: Versus, and, the game of the hour, Guilty Gear Strive, we are promised hours of intense fighting action across three days, as each game looks to crown its champion for the current EVO season. In addition, we can expect news, updates, and reveals pertaining to some of the current and upcoming fighters. Who is headed to Street Fighter 6? What…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo condensed their Pokemon Presents stream
Just the other day we got a lengthy Pokemon Presents video that dug deep into Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news: now we have a distillation of that mainline focus while cutting out all the other stuff.  Titled &quot;world overview,&quot; the video was put up separately the day after the presentation, and serves as a six-minute rundown of the Scarlet and Violet bits.
As a recap, here is what the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet news video entails:
The overview of the &quot;partner legendary&quot; system, which allows you to use the new box legendaries as vehicles (land, sea, and air)
A breakdown of the story, and how you&#x27;re playing the role of a student at either the Naranja (Scarlet) or Uva (Violet) academy
There are &quot;eight gyms, three stories, and no set path&quot; for conquering the gyms and story progression
An intro to some of the cast (Professors Sada and Turo, Director Clavell, Mr. Jacq, your friend Nemona, Arven the upperclassman, Penny the &quot;shy student,&quot; and Grusha the ice type gym leader)
A reminder of some existing old Pokemon, as well as the regional Wooper Paldean form, Fidough, and Cetitan
Footage of the multiplayer function, involving co-op with up to three people and raid battles
The Terastal gimmick, where Pokemon crystalize and can change types
After this presentation, I&#x27;m pretty into Scarlet and Violet, mostly due to the promise of the partner exploration system and multiplayer, in tandem. It sounds like a good time to just connect with someone and roam around the Paldea region.

                              <span>Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares
Tencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin&#x27;s Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.
Citing multiple sources &quot;with direct knowledge of the matter,&quot; Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share&#x27;s current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .
There have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company&#x27;s initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.
Tencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.

                              <span>Announced at BitSummit
Inti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.
Grim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says &quot;swapping characters is key to gameplay,&quot; and in addition to solo play, there&#x27;s also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.
Amazingly, Inti Creates is calling this &quot;the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games,&quot; hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn&#x27;t going to do it, someone else should!
Grim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info
As for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as &quot;TBD,&quot; but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we&#x27;ll get that info.
Just as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I&#x27;m game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians. This is an easy sell.

                              <span>It&#x27;s raw
I hate reality TV, but I love Gordon Ramsey. Perhaps it’s better to say I like the character that Gordon Ramsey plays, as I understand that he’s not actually that caustic in person. He talks to people like I talk to Ninja Gaiden on the NES; nothing but derision.
Recipe for Disaster is definitely feeding off Kitchen Nightmares. During its early access period, it seemed to highlight that you were hiring a bunch of unique personalities and throwing them into a stew. You’re thrust into a series of struggling restaurants with the intent of rescuing them from their terrible owners. The question is: does Recipe for Disaster deliver on this tantalizing concept? The biggest question is: can Recipe for Disaster convince me not to just reinstall Pizza Connection 2?

                              <span>A new GDK update could see some graphical improvements for the Series S
A recent update to Microsoft&#x27;s Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.
In the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.
&quot;Hundreds of megabytes&quot; have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Bb6ZLGwkClM
As Ars Technica details, this hasn&#x27;t been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft&#x27;s current-gen hardware.
More memory for the box
This seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical &quot;oomph&quot; on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft&#x27;s two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.
The relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It&#x27;s especially nice for those who aren&#x27;t necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;94O6o6yOGgA
Hopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn&#x27;t a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.
The GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We&#x27;ll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.

Microsoft has begun testing a new family plan option for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and I&#x27;m hopeful that it rolls out to the rest of the world sooner than later. Xbox Insiders in Colombia and Ireland can add up to four people to their subscription.
&quot;This makes it even easier to play the best Game Pass games with friends and family across console, PC, and cloud by enabling you to add up to four people to your subscription, all with their own unique access to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games, content, and benefits,&quot; said Sr. Technical Program Manager Tyler Mittleider.
There are a few caveats to keep in mind for the test run, as detailed on the Xbox Wire blog.

Brace Yourself Games is adding even more content to Crypt of the Necrodancer, in the form of a DLC update called Synchrony. The new update was revealed today and is available now in Early Access.
Crypt of the Necrodancer: Synchrony is a brand new content pack, adding a wealth of new features to 2015&#x27;s rhythm roguelite classic Crypt of the Necrodancer. It&#x27;s currently only available on PC, though Brace Yourself says it would like to port to other consoles once Synchrony is out of Early Access.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MX9JlggiCHo
So what&#x27;s in the update? Well, a big portion is online multiplayer support. Synchrony adds support for up to eight players, in online co-op and versus modes. That&#x27;s a whole lot of hoppin&#x27; and bouncin&#x27; to the beat.

Not only were we asked to play with a substantially smaller library of games than what we had on Wii or Wii U, but I didn&#x27;t even have the option to buy those games. Instead, we were given a small library of games from a single console with no way to carry over entitlements from previous purchases or actually own the classic games I was playing. I felt Nintendo Switch Online was a worse service in every way, even as Nintendo expanded the offerings to include a robust NES and SNES library.

                              <span>Saturnalia is an upcoming indie survival horror with one of the most interesting visual styles I’ve seen in the genre in a minute. 
Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, Saturnalia is influenced heavily by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, and inspired by Italian Giallo horror films (typically more horror-esque mystery thrillers). In it, you control four different characters, all connected through a mysterious storyline that ties back to the “haunting traditions” of an ancient village. 
“The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same – you will have to explore and solve mysteries of the game largely unguided,” the game’s website reads. “Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.” 
All of that sounds great, but Saturnalia&#x27;s unique art style makes me most excited. It’s like a mix of stop-motion and sketchbook, which looks like it’ll lend itself nicely to the game&#x27;s horror elements. Check it out for yourself below:


Santa Ragione is the studio behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia. Saturnalia does not yet a launch date, but it will hit PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store sometime in 2022. The studio is planning to launch the game on other platforms, but the timing on that remains TBA.

                              <span>When Sonic Origins arrived on consoles and PC in June, it delivered a four-pack of classic Sonic the Hedgehog games from the &#x27;90s. While the bundle was praised for bringing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD to modern platforms with various gameplay enhancements and other additions, it was also heavily criticized. Various bugs, mislabeled titles in the in-game museum, and overall stability (particularly with the PC version) frustrated the player base as they waited for Sega to fix the problems. This week, Sega released that long-awaited patch, addressing those problems and more, hopefully stabilizing the compilation and making the overall experience more enjoyable.
The two biggest items this patch addresses include fixing issues with the game crashing and one of the most annoying bugs of the year: Tails falling behind in Sonic 2 and constantly jumping instead of respawning on the player – we can finally turn off mute when playing Sonic 2. The patch also includes fixes for sound bugs, menu and controller issues, museum mislabels, and data-saving issues. Unfortunately, the replacement music in Ice Cap, Carnival Night, and Launch Base remain in place. 
The patch is available to download now for all platforms. Sonic Origins arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on June 23. For more on the speedy selection of games, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi. 
As it has done with most of its recent cabinets, Arcade1Up offers more than just the game on the marquee. You can see the full list of eight classic Marvel games included in this cabinet below.
Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Marvel vs. Capcom
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter
X-Men vs. Street Fighter
Marvel Super Heroes
X-Men: Children of the Atom
X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been largely unavailable since 2013, with home digital versions getting delisted or physical copies skyrocketing in price. Arcade1Up&#x27;s Marvel vs. Capcom 2 cabinet opens up for pre-orders starting September 8, with orders shipping a few weeks later in early October. The package includes a matching custom riser, light-up marquee, a headphone jack, and exclusive side-panel art. You can sign up to be notified of when pre-orders go live at Arcade1Up&#x27;s official page.</span>

                              <span>I love Final Fantasy. I’ve played nearly every numbered entry and have beaten most of them. I adore Final Fantasy Tactics. I watched both terrible feature films. My ringtone is the FFVII victory fanfare theme. But the biggest hole in my fandom for years has been Final Fantasy XIV.
MMOs have never appealed to me, but as I listened to friends and colleagues rave about FFXIV over its long existence, the more I felt like I was missing out on something special. Every expansion and free trial had me hovering over the purchase button, but I always told myself I didn’t have the time to invest in such a behemoth of a game. The excuses have come to an end. 
I’ve finally broken the seal and dived headfirst into one of the most celebrated games on the planet. Join me on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as I trek through my first dungeon with the help of two of the biggest FFXIV experts I know. First up is the returning Jon Woodey, Game Informer web programmer extraordinaire. I’ll also have a special guest: MinnMax cohort Sarah Podzorski joins our party to lend her bubbly brand of insight. Watch along to learn some valuable tips and tricks and, if you’re like me, get an early taste of FFXIV to see if it’s something you want to jump into as well!

The HBO Max film, Batgirl, a complete movie, has been canned alongside a sequel to 2020’s Scoob!

                              <span>Much in the same way Nintendo recently released its financial results for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2023, which ends March 2023, Capcom has done the same. As a result, we now have an updated list of the best-selling Capcom games as of June 30, 2022, which is when the company’s latest financial quarter ended, as reported by MyNintendoNews. 
If you’re a Capcom fan, there’s likely no surprise as to which games are at the top, but there might be a few surprises for you in it elsewhere.
Here are the top 10 best-selling Capcom games: 
Monster Hunter World: 18.3 million 
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard: 11 million
Monster Hunter Rise: 10.3 million
Resident Evil 2: 9.8 million
Monster Hunter World: Iceborn: 9.5 million 
Resident Evil 5: 8.3 million
Resident Evil 6: 8.3 million
Street Fighter V: 6.6 million
Resident Evil Village: 6.4 million
Street Fighter II: 6.3 million
As you can see, this list is mostly Monster Hunter and Resident Evil, as anyone tuned into Capcom’s releases probably could have guessed. However, it&#x27;s important to note that Capcom, strangely, breaks each individual release up as its own game, meaning each of the multiple Resident Evil 4 re-releases counts as its own game. Collectively, though, Resident Evil 4 would be on this top 10 list. The same can be said for various other titles, such as Dragon&#x27;s Dogma and its re-release, and more. 
Now that you’ve seen this top 10 list, go check out the top 10 best-selling games on Switch and then read Game Informer’s review of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, the recent expansion for the game. After that, read about Capcom’s remake of Resident Evil 4, which is due out next March.

                              <span>PlayStation revealed that the long-rumored remake of The Last of Us was real in a leak hours before Naughty Dog could officially reveal it during Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but alas, it’s real nonetheless.
Following in the steps of its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, the remake is called The Last of Us Part 1, and it’s beautiful. It will also cost $70, and some fans have criticized Naughty Dog and PlayStation for that price, citing that $70 is a high price tag for a game released on the PlayStation 3 before getting remastered for the PlayStation 4 a year later. It also appears to be very much the same game – just with improved graphics and some changes to AI systems and other under-the-hood things. Nonetheless, it’s out on Sept. 1 and will cost $70. 
Since the reveal, Naughty Dog has been slowly dolling out information about the upcoming title, including neat comparison videos that showcase how drastic the visual upgrades are. The studio released a new one this morning, this time comparing a sequence with Ellie and Joel riding horses on a road. Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the difference is night and day, with the remake looking a lot more like Part II. For more information, be sure to read our write-up about all the changes coming to The Last of Us Part I, and then read Game Informer’s original review of The Last of Us.

Wisdom from those who have tried opening a restaurant informs you that it isn’t the easiest way to make money. If Recipe for Disaster is any indication, running a successful eatery is a challenging, trial-and-error affair with plenty of stress and frustration, but one that, once mastered, offers excitement and gratification to balance it all out.
In this restaurant-management sim, you manage staff, monitor your business, and work to ensure your lights stay on. Hiring the right employees to develop a balanced team composition and designing a functional and visually appealing restaurant are i…</span>

A second lawsuit won by Movistar Plus+ allows the TV platform to advise local ISPs of piracy-facilitating sites on a weekly basis and have them blocked within three hours.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of the Ultimate Audio Bang, we get all nostalgic as we pick our favourite FPS game modes over the years. It&#x27;s mainly an excuse for me for me to bring up Gears Of War and it&#x27;s long-forgotten Wingman mode, which I demand make a return to the series. I also learn that Hayden likes big games, big modes, and big comradery.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think I like the game Descenders ostensibly is, but I enjoy playing. It&#x27;s a downhill mountain biking game with dangerous speeds and even more dangerous stunts, including leaping through a ring of fire over of a moving train. This is fun. The roguelikelike campaign structure this is all built into, eh, I don&#x27;t think it has added any enjoyment. But it is very fun to stack a double-backflip, slam into a rock, and watch your ragdoll corpse rocket downhill. It&#x27;s a good reminder to ride whichever way you enjoy, expectations and pressures be damned.

                              <span>My exposure to summer camps is entirely through films and games. Summer camp culture isn&#x27;t as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we&#x27;re fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I&#x27;ve seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they&#x27;re good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.

Enter Saturnalia, &quot;a fever dream inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian culture and classic Italian giallo horror films&quot;. Announced a year ago and &quot;coming soon&quot; in 2022 to the Epic Games Store, this extremely unsettling slice of nope - but also yes - just got a new trailer. If Stanley Tucci visited this town on his quest to eat nice ravioli, his final piece to camera would be from inside an imminently-afire wicker effigy.

One of the most fun (and frustrating) ways to play an old favorite is trying to complete a self-imposed challenge that really ratchets up the difficulty. For me, it was beating a run in Hades on 32 heat — for others, it might be completing a Dark Souls run without taking damage or doing a Nuzlocke of a favorite Pokémon game. When you love a game enough to put the hours in that you need to complete a challenge like this, you&#x27;d be surprised at how much you can accomplish — and by how triumphant it feels when you finally beat it. I imagine that streamer Jervalin is riding even higher after winning a $20,000 cash prize for beating a near-impossible challenge in Halo 2.

Who doesn&#x27;t love a good video game sidekick? I&#x27;ve been playing through some of the old Ratchet &amp; Clank games with a friend, and while A Crack in Time is one of the best of the series, my biggest gripe is that we don&#x27;t get enough Ratchet and Clank quality time. Maybe I&#x27;m just too sentimental, but I really love seeing best buddy characters in my games, and Clank makes just about the best sidekick a girl could ask for.
He&#x27;s got it all — an adorable personality, quippy dialogue, useful game mechanics, he never gets in the way, and his gameplay sections break things up and provide some cool puzzle mechanics. Clank is so awesome, he got me thinking about some other great — and not so great — sidekicks in video games.
No one likes a useless sidekick

                              <span>It&#x27;s to establish a new identity, and also a bit easier to say
Koch Media, a games publisher under the grand umbrella of the Embracer Group, is changing up its name. The publisher formerly known as Koch is now Plaion, as the 28-year-old company is rebranding.
Under the moniker of Koch Media, the company operated publishing labels like Deep Silver and Prime Matter. It&#x27;s part of various games and brands, ranging from Homefront and Metro to Saints Row and Dead Island. The company was purchased by Embracer Group (THQ Nordic at the time) in 2018. Now, it will operate under a new name.
In a press release, Plaion says this new name will better represent the company&#x27;s history and the groups it works with.
&quot;Our new name offers us the opportunity to build on our rich history as a publishing partner and our outstanding, constantly growing network of world-class development studios and creative people, to keep delivering premium service to our partners, to highlight our ambition as a global player within the entertainment industry but also to reinvent ourselves,&quot; said Plaion managing director Klemens Kundratitz. &quot;Our vision is to enable and inspire our worldwide teams and partners, unlocking their full potential.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YgjzDJA1o1E
What&#x27;s in a name?
Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz about the name change, Kundratitz also expresses hope that the name change will make more of an international impact.
&quot;Our name for so many years was associated with physical distribution, perhaps with us being more of a central European company–although including the UK because that was among the first three countries where we launched,&quot; Kundratitz told GIbiz. &quot;But we&#x27;re perhaps not seen as a global company. And it&#x27;s sometimes difficult for some people to pronounce.&quot;
For the record, Plaion is easy to pronounce. It&#x27;s just play-on. The company&#x27;s new logo is also stylized around the common triangle used for Play.

Developer Glumberland shared the news on Twitter, stating that they’ll announce the release date of the game’s full launch in the near future. Pre-orders for the recently announced Switch version will begin soon as well.
We just found out that Ooblets has gone 🌟GOLD🌟!!

August 4, 2022
Ooblets was first announced in 2016 and has been playable in PC early access and Xbox Game Preview since 2020. The farming sim game tasks players with planting and growing lovable creatures called Ooblets, who can then perform tasks and battle other Ooblets in dance battles. You can decorate and expand your farm, plus complete side quests from the many residents of Badge Town. Ooblets has received numerous content updates over the years, such as new creatures, locations, decor, and even seasons. Glumberland announced in May that the game would go 1.0 this summer, so today&#x27;s news seems to reaffirm that release window. 
We&#x27;ve enjoyed Ooblets whenever we&#x27;ve checked in on it over the years, so it&#x27;s exciting to see it approaching the finish line. Ooblets is slated to launch for Xbox One, Switch, and PC via The Epic Games Store.</span>

                              <span>Mega Man fans in the west got a surprise treat with the global launch of Mega Man Battle &amp; Fighters on Switch. The game was originally released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and has never been released outside of Japan until now. 
The game was first released in 2000 and serves as a portable bundle of two arcade games: Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters (both of which were recently included in the Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium collection). Players can play as Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo to engage in a series of boss battles against robot masters from Mega Man 1 through 7. A total of 40 bosses await, and players gain character data by defeating them with the added goal of filling a personal database. 


Despite launching stateside, this is a largely direct port of the Japanese version, and the game’s original link cable trading function has been disabled. You can pick it up now for $7.99.</span>

As a kid who grew up with little money, I’ve always loved the fantasy tycoon games realize: the possibility of cashing in on whimsical business schemes like theme parks, restaurants, and aquariums. It’s always been satisfying to start with an empty plot of land and then build the foundation of a business atop it, customizing small details like paint colors, furniture layouts, and walking paths along the way. 
But the genre’s bubble gum aesthetics often mask a darker side – one prioritizing profit over peopl…</span>

                              <span>Like Xbox and PlayStation, Nintendo also suffers from supply issues and component shortages. This might explain why a recent Nikkei report – relayed by Bloomberg&#x27;s game and tech writer, Takashi Mochizuki (see below) – stated that there wouldn&#x27;t be new hardware releases this fiscal year. 
Nikkei: there will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said. https://t.co/HJVqk9Kbef

Mochizuki&#x27;s tweet reads, &quot;There will be no new Nintendo hardware this fiscal year, which ends in March 2023. Not immediately clear whether that part of the article is from Nikkei&#x27;s own reporting or what Nintendo President, who Nikkei interviewed for the story, said.&quot;
For all the Nintendo fans speculating a Switch “Pro” release – sorry, it looks like that’s not happening any time soon. In any case, the Switch recently crossed 111 million units sold, but overall sales are down by 22.9%. Perhaps Nintendo will pivot to hardware announcements after the fiscal year comes to a close.</span>

                              <span>Square Enix has revealed Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the classic Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, and it’s releasing in just over three months. 
More specifically, it will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on Nov. 11. Square Enix revealed this heavily rumored (and leaked) remaster today with the first official trailer, and you can check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Tactics Ogre: Reborn now features voice acting, improved visuals, and more. Square Enix says, “Tactics Ogre: Reborn features updated game design, fully-voiced cutscenes, improved graphics, and sound.” Tactics Ogre: Reborn will be available as a physical and digital Standard Edition on PS5, PS4, and Switch and a digital-only Standard Edition on PC. A digital Premium Edition will be available for all platforms the game is coming to later this year. 
The digital Standard Edition includes a selection of three songs from the remaster’s soundtrack as a preorder bonus. The digital Premium Edition contains the entire soundtrack as a preorder bonus and a “Tactics Ogre (1995) Digital Mini Soundtrack.” 
While waiting for Tactics Ogre: Reborn to hit PlayStation, Switch consoles, and PC this November, read our thoughts on the original in the Game Informer Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together review. Check out this Game Informer Replay segment on Tactics Ogre after that.

                              <span>The crossover brawler of our dreams, MultiVersus, is the fighting genre&#x27;s latest prize winner. From Adventure Time to Game of Thrones, Player First Games&#x27; debut title is a wacky fusion of legendary franchises that&#x27;s left fans enamored with the light-hearted art style and Super Smash-inspired gameplay. Sadly, the rising champ&#x27;s first season and next playable character, Morty (Rick &amp; Morty), have been pushed back. A finalized release date remains unknown.  
We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 &amp; the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players. (2/3)
August 4, 2022
Tweets released by the MultiVersus dev team thank players for their continued support and patience while announcing the unexpected news (seen above). You can read the complete statement below:
Season 1 was initially slated to launch on August 9. For now, you&#x27;ll just have to keep busy kicking Lebron James&#x27; butt. John Carson previewed MultiVersus for us and concluded his findings by stating, &quot;I went into the alpha test of MultiVersus with low expectations. Besides Smash Bros., the big brand mash-up fighters feel hollow and feature underwhelming rosters, but I&#x27;ve come away impressed with what I&#x27;ve played so far. The cast is great so far, and each character brings unique gameplay and mechanics to the fray.&quot;

                              <span>Funcom and The Outsiders have announced a metal concert happening at this year&#x27;s Gamescom in Cologne, Germany to celebrate the impending release of their heavy metal rhythmic shooting game, Metal: Hellsinger. The concert, which takes place on August 25, hopes to become the largest concert ever put on at the massive annual gaming convention. 
Several of the vocalists featured in Metal: Hellsinger will be on hand to perform their songs from the soundtrack. Matt Heafy of Trivium, Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy, Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquility, Dennis Lyxzén of Refused and INVSN, and James Dorton of Black Crown Initiate are all currently scheduled to take the stage. The concert is set to kick off at 7 p.m. Central European Summer Time (1 p.m. Eastern/10 a.m. Pacific). The event is free and open to thousands of in-person attendees, with potentially millions being able to join through a livestream, which will be detailed at a later date. The first 200 people to enter the hall for the concert will receive a bag full of exclusive Metal: Hellsinger merchandise.


Metal: Hellsinger comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 15. If you want to try the game for yourself, a demo is currently available on all three of those platforms. If you&#x27;d rather read my hands-on impressions, you can do so here.</span>

As CJ reported last week, Frogwares now intend to close the circle by pitting hot Holmes against (hot?) Cthulhu creatures in a remake of 2007&#x27;s The Awakened. Its Kickstarter project launched today and there&#x27;s a reveal trailer below.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re changing your company&#x27;s name in part because it&#x27;s hard to pronounce, you&#x27;d presumably want to change it to something with zero ambiguity. Seemingly not, if publisher Koch Media are any indication, as they announced today that they&#x27;ve changed their name to Plaion. At least the mispronunciations are now lower stakes.

Ubisoft have maintained that the project isn&#x27;t cancelled, and here&#x27;s at least a little proof: narrative designer Sarah Arellano announced via Twitter that she&#x27;s joined the project as lead writer.

                              <span>The Sims 4 received patch 1.90.375.1020 today, which has a short set of patch notes. One of the included bug fixes is that &quot;The &#x27;Ask to be Girlfriend/Boyfriend&#x27; Want now targets appropriate Sims&quot;, which sounds innocuous enough. In reality, this is fixing a bug Rebecca reported on last week which was causing Sims to want to date their siblings.

This is the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for this model, actually, even lower than it was during Prime Day, so it&#x27;s well worth picking this up if you&#x27;re after a high-speed drive for your PC or PS5.

If all had gone according to the original plan, they’d already be out and playable, but repeated delays have hit, leaving only one card – the low-end Arc A380 – having a muted launch in China only. As of early August, the full range of GPUs haven’t even been announced in an official capacity. These were meant to finally provide the competition to Nvidia and AMD’s best graphics cards, so where’s the deets?

Shenzhen is absolutely worth a go if you enjoy Zachlike puzzlers, and Turbo Golf looks like one of those &quot;could be fun, sure I&#x27;ll give it a try&quot; Game Pass games.

                              <span>Chinese gaming and social media giants Tencent have approached Ubisoft’s founders, the Guillemot family, in an effort to expand their stake in the AAA publisher, Reuters report. Tencent acquired a 5% stake in Ubisoft in 2018 and now multiple anonymous sources are now saying that Tencent intends to become the single largest shareholder in the publisher, a company valued at almost $6 billion (£4.9 billion).

                              <span>Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but &#x27;round these parts we refer to it as &quot;The Laughing Deer Show&quot;. New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as &quot;barely contained&quot;. Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn&#x27;t really &quot;do&quot; guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).
Now, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger&#x27;s action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol&#x27; stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character&#x27;s action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball.

                              <span>Apex Legends: Hunted is soon to release, and leading the charge is Vantage - the youngest Legend ever inducted (or abducted) into the Apex Games. Vantage hails from the icy world of Pagos, and her skills as a sharpshooter are borne out in her three powerful abilities - not least of which is her custom sniper rifle Ultimate, which she can bring out before the ability has even fully charged in order to snipe enemies and mark them for increased damage for her entire team.
Take a closer look at her dangerous-sounding abilities in the new Apex Legends vignette trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;m back from my holidays to record The Electronic Wireless Show podcast once again, and I&#x27;ve brought a reader email and a new tattoo of Murray from Monkey Island with me. These are both relevant, because the email from James suggests that we talk about the games that we&#x27;d like to play for the first time again - just erase them from our heads and encounter them anew. Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.
In fact, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can&#x27;t be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question &quot;what games would you play for the first time again?&quot; more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory? Listen in to find out.

                              <span>Two Point Campus trades the operating rooms of its predecessor Two Point Hospital for lecture theatres and decrepit dorms. But its foundations remain the same: you&#x27;re a manager with a budget and you&#x27;ve got to turn the fortunes of increasingly prestigious – and in some cases, bonkers – institutions around. Of course, this time you&#x27;re not dealing with injured mummies and lazy surgeons, you&#x27;re in charge of running university campuses (campi?) and ensuring they deliver a solid education.
The job of a university president is a pretty relaxed affair, which means you&#x27;re able to soak in the joys of watching your oddball students grow. But this leniency means it struggles to reward you for constructing a campus that&#x27;s uniquely yours.

The mountain biking game is full of gnarly descents, dangerous jumps, and barely controlled skids, but also has secret spots where you can sit down and enjoy a nice view for as long as you like. Lonely Mountains is a collection of little adventures, each leading to your tent at the end of the day. Delightful.

Following a DMCA takedown notice sent to Github on behalf of Sky UK, which complains about the availability of a single TV episode, Cloudstream-3&#x27;s main development repo has been consigned to history.

                              <span>Charter Communications and several major record labels have settled their lawsuits over the ISP&#x27;s handling of repeat copyright infringers. The deal was signed around the same time that the ISP&#x27;s daughter company Bright House settled its case. No further details are available but with hundreds of millions of dollars in damages at stake, negotiations must have been tough.

                              <span>V červnu Google ve spolupráci se Skywater Technologies a Efabless představil iniciativu Open Source Silicon umožňující komukoli navrhnout open source integrovaný obvod a nechat si jej zdarma vyrobit. Při představení byla k dispozici pouze výrobní technologie 130 nm. Před týdnem bylo oznámeno, že společnost Skywater Technologies nabízí už také výrobní technologii 90 nm. Včera se k iniciativě Open Source Silicon připojila společnost GlobalFoundries a nabídla výrobní technologii 180 nm.</span>

                              <span>Since its first season launch in 2016, I’ve always felt like the Westworld TV series offered an especially compelling commentary on the video game hobby. Like a lot of sci-fi, the show leverages futuristic technology and far-fetched ideas to get its point across. But at its core, it’s still a show about the psychology of people playing a game and how that game is really just about life and the decisions we make that shape that life. Westworld may not borrow from a longstanding video game license. Still, with its incisive and often surprising perspectives, it has emerged as the best show about video games, their potential, and their threat that I’ve ever seen.
SPOILERS follow for the entirety of the Westworld TV series, up to and including current episodes of Season 4.

                              <span>Throughout 2022&#x27;s Pokémon Go Fest events in cities like Seattle, Berlin, and Sapporo, Ultra Beasts, wormhole-dwelling creatures introduced in Gen VII&#x27;s Pokémon Sun and Moon, have appeared for trainers to catch. If you weren&#x27;t able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you&#x27;ve missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.
The finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.
Finally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. 
Since the game&#x27;s launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo released its latest round of financial results, this time for Quarter 1 of the 2023 Fiscal Year, which accounts for April, May, and June of 2022. In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. 
In terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. 
Here are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: 
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million 
Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud-based gaming service, Luna, is the latest addition to the Samsung Gaming Hub, a recently added feature available on all 2022 Samsung smart TV and smart monitor models. Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.
The hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game&#x27;s entitlement on Google Stadia but another&#x27;s rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.
Amazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you&#x27;re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month&#x27;s offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin&#x27;s Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. 
Through the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company&#x27;s new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.</span>

During the extended trailer and subsequent deep dive, we received new info about the region in which the games take place, how multiplayer works, some of the Pokémon players will encounter during their adventure, and the new Terastal phenomenon that allows Pokémon to change.
In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players embark on an adventure in the Paldea region, a massive area full of lakes, mountains, wastelands, and more. Outside of its natural lands…</span>

The Pokémon Company describes the Paldea region as &quot;a land of vast open spaces dotted with lakes, towering peaks, wastelands, and mountain ranges.&quot; Players can expect everything from small farming villages to bustling port towns.

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling’s first triple-A wrestling title, AEW: Fight Forever, takes a few significant steps towards becoming a reality. After heavy rumors, THQ Nordic is confirmed as the game’s publisher. Moreover, we got a rundown of the game’s modes, a batch of fresh screenshots, as well as the unveiling of the box art. 
AEW: Fight Forever is being developed by Yuke’s and has been billed as an homage to classic, arcade-style wrestling games such as WWF No Mercy (including input from director Hideyuki “Geta” Iwashita). In addition to capturing an old-school feel, the game hopes to emulate AEW&#x27;s in-ring style with the newly revealed addition of elaborate tandem offense moves for tag team bouts. 
First off, here’s what the box art looks like:

More specifically, hardware sales for Nintendo are down 22.9% this quarter. Broken up, the base Switch&#x27;s sales are down 60% in Q1 while Switch Lite sales are down 48.4%. Nintendo did not report OLED model Switch sales, possibly because it groups the OLED model with the base Switch. As for why hardware sales are down this quarter, Nintendo sites the ongoing semiconductor shortage, which affects other hardware makers like Xbox and PlayStation too.

​NBA 2K is still in a rebuilding phase. While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year&#x27;s game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.
We still don&#x27;t have insight into any of this year&#x27;s modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan&#x27;s career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word &quot;authenticity&quot; to sum up this year&#x27;s changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:
Easier Play
More Pro for the Pro Stick
Hang on the Rim
Shooting is a Weapon
Killing Stalls with Adrenaline 
Defensive Play
Improved A.I.
Badges Sound More Confusing But Better?

                              <span>Puzzles are fun. Exploring floating islands is pretty boss too. That’s why open-world puzzle game Project S, announced at the end of the Behaviour Beyond stream today, has me raising an intrigued eyebrow as I lower my pipe to peer from behind a broadsheet newspaper. “I say, that looks rather like Breath Of The Wild, but with bits from The Witness and a faint hint of Myst,” I declare to Watson. “Astute observation, Wheeler,” he replies, “but why don’t you have a proper look at the trailer below?”

Good news for them today then, because visual novel Hooked On You: A Dead By Daylight Dating Sim just surprise-launched exclusively on Steam. Watch the trailer below to see a more playful side to four of DBD’s serial killers, which isn’t something I ever thought I’d type.

Wesker’s arrival is the second time Resident Evil has crossed over into DBD, but the upcoming Project W event will revamp the Raccoon Police Department map and bring along familiar Resi characters Rebecca Chambers and Ada Wong as playable survivors. Barricade yourself inside the police station of your mind and watch the trailer below.

Revealed during today’s Behaviour Beyond stream, Meet Your Maker is the next game from the devs behind survival horror Dead By Daylight.

The kind that promises, naturally with the right purchases, to help you shoot better or drive cars faster or generally be a more PRO ELITE WINNER in competitive games.
For me, there have been two such technologies I’ve never really bought into: ultra-high 360Hz monitor refresh rates, and Nvidia Reflex, a kind of setup-wide latency reduction system. Now, having spent some quality time with the MSI Oculux NXG253R – which features both – I’ll cop to being wrong about one of them.

                              <span>All Elite Wrestling announced like, I dunno, three games at once a couple of years ago. They all sounded terrible and we haven&#x27;t posted about them (also because a bunch of them aren&#x27;t on PC). AEW: Fight Forever, still officially Coming Soon, is their first crack at a sweaty graps sim to rival WWE&#x27;s series, and today it was confirmed the publisher is THQ Nordic. This not only means that we&#x27;ll see more gameplay at next week&#x27;s THQ Nordic showcase, per a tiny teaser, but it adds another horse to the confusing carousel of companies that have worked on wrestling sims.

You have chosen your favourite little bits—of games, not corpses—and our quest resumes. This week, we pick between two forms of really committing to a game&#x27;s reality. What&#x27;s better: cameras which actually take pictures, or running into a wall so fast you hurt yourself?

                              <span>Whomst among us didn&#x27;t watch Whip It over a decade ago and think about giving full-contact skating sport a go, before falling over on once and deciding to pack it in? I have a bunch of friends who persisted and now spend their weekends in gyms and car parks, where they skate under 11/10 names like Correctional Felicity and give each other huge bruises. I can&#x27;t be sure, but from their activity on social media I estimate they spend about 114% of their time being excited about roller derby, which I endorse. Now both they (and people like me, who find wheels frightening), can spend even more free time on roller derby with the annoucenment of 2023&#x27;s sports management game Roller Drama.

                              <span>It’s fair to say that Deck Nine had a lot to prove with Life Is Strange: True Colors. While it wasn’t their first Life Is Strange - the Colorado studio released the spin-off  game Before The Storm in 2017 - it was the first time they were tasked with creating their own world and characters, instead of inheriting Dontnod’s creations. 


Fortunately Deck Nine successfully managed the tightrope walk of honouring the series’ existing DNA, while still taking the Life Is Strange world in new directions. To find out more about how it was done, I sat down with Philip Lawrence and Sarah Van Rompeay, respectively the Senior Narrative Designer and Senior Producer at Square Enix External Studios.

                              <span>The latest Steam Deck software update, comprised of both a client update and SteamOS 3.3, is out now. It’s a fat stack of improvements and fixes, too, including a handful of brand new features.
You can read the full patch notes on Steam, but I’ll give you the highlights, which include a new warning that pops up when the Steam Deck’s temperature “goes outside the safe operating range”. When it starts throttling, in other words, a threshold that many Deck owners have been discovering during recent heatwaves. I have an overheating notification feature myself, only it’s just me typing “too hot” in the RPS Slack.

YouTube). Přímo HDR streamování pak funguje jen s YouTube HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) a formátem HEVC, OBS může pro zachytávání HDR streamu využívat hardware s podporou HDR (např.

If so, today&#x27;s benchmarks are for you with putting the Core i7 1280P on Windows 11 up against Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Intel&#x27;s own Clear Linux platform.</span>

                              <span>We spotted a rare discount on Lenovo&#x27;s brand new Legion 5i Pro 16 laptop, and it&#x27;s a high-end model with a 12th-gen Core i7 processor, RTX 3070 Ti graphics card and a stunning 16-in 2560x1600 165Hz display. Normally this laptop retails for £1500, but thanks to an Ebay code (AUG15) you can take £60 off. This isn&#x27;t a massive discount, but it&#x27;s a notable price reduction for a laptop that is literally brand new with the latest-gen tech inside.

The 360mm CoreLiquid 360R is down to £60 when you use code AUG15, while the CoreLiquid 280R is down to £52 using the same one. This is a massive reduction from their original prices and a frankly unbeatable deal for a liquid cooler with decent fans, RGB lighting and good thermal performance.

                              <span>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla may have seen the last of its paid DLC with Dawn Of Ragnarök in March, but today’s free Forgotten Saga update is hoping to draw you back into the game again and again. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s inspired by roguelites, see. Refresh your memory about Valhalla by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>With cancelled pre-order comes small discount. Isn’t that the motto of Spider-Man? Well, it’s close enough under the circumstances. Steam have recommended scrapping your pre-order of upcoming webslingathon Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered because the game was priced too high in some territories. The price drop only applies in a few regions, but means that anyone who pre-ordered the game there might want to cancel theirs and buy it again. Or, you know, just wait until the game’s out.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

                              <span>Herschel &quot;Guy&quot; Beahm IV, known by most as Dr. Disrespect, helped form a &quot;AAA game studio&quot; with former Call of Duty and Halo developers in December of last year. Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio&#x27;s first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it&#x27;s a PvPvE extraction shooter. 
Now, Midnight Society&#x27;s first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it&#x27;s less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games.

As you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. 
The reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn&#x27;t help that Beahm tweeted, &quot;I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine&quot; back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty&#x27;s visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen.

Even if you&#x27;ve made it rich in Sea of Thieves and are loaded to the gills in gold, you can only purchase one of each type of ship: the Sloop, Brigantine, and Galleon. Within the teaser video above, we see the Sloop goes for 250,000 gold, the Brigantine for 375,000, and the four-person Galleon at 500,000. Once one of these vessels is yours for the keeping, you can give it a name, and it&#x27;ll appear on a wooden plaque on the ship&#x27;s crest.

                              <span>Internet provider Bright House has resolved its legal dispute with several RIAA-backed record labels. The ISP stood accused of turning a blind eye to pirating subscribers and faced millions of dollars in potential damages. The parties reached an agreement at the last minute as the trial was scheduled to start tomorrow.

                              <span>To reduce piracy on the Switch console, last week Nintendo used a DMCA notice to target a popular &#x27;sigpatch&#x27; repository on Github. While the coding platform ultimately took the repo down, it appears there was a difference of opinion over what type of infringement they represent. So what are &#x27;sigpatches&#x27;, why do they even need to exist, and why might they breach copyright law?

                              <span>Začátkem července zamířil do projektu Mesa přepsaný NIR backend R600g vylepšující běh OpenGL pro Radeony HD 5000 a HD 6000, tedy pre-GCN modely generace Evergreen. Pár týdnů práce vývojářů (no, vlastně jde prakticky jen o Gerta Wollnyho) nyní vyústilo v rozšíření této funkcionality i na starší modely. Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.</span>

                              <span>Update: The same card is now on sale at Ebuyer for £310 - the next best price after CCL&#x27;s stock sold out. Original article continues below: 
I was going to head in a different direction for my second deals post of the night, but when I spotted this deal on a great mid-range AMD graphics card I knew I had to double-dip on CCL&#x27;s excellent summer sale. 
The British retailer is offering the AMD RX 6700 for £299 when you use code AFF15, bringing a PowerColor Fighter OC model down to the lowest price we&#x27;ve seen for this class of card. The 6700 is a strong contender for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and this factory overclocked model ought to outperform other options in the field.

                              <span>RTX 3080 graphics cards are continuing their inevitable price decline, as at least one new next-gen GPU is rumoured to be announced within the next few months. That means it&#x27;s a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we&#x27;ve ever seen it. 
Right now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you&#x27;re not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it&#x27;s one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me.

                              <span>While the Tour De France Femmes ended on Sunday and the Tour Hommes the week before, I&#x27;ll not be rushed on my own Tour De Jeux. I can&#x27;t keep pace with professionals so it&#x27;s fine if I run long, and today I want to take my time and enjoy the journey. I&#x27;m playing Aran&#x27;s Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It&#x27;s a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.

                              <span>Microsoft have justified their $68.7 billion ($56 billion) purchase of Call Of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard by telling regulators that the company doesn’t produce “must have” games. If that’s making you ask why they’d stump up more than any other tech buyout in history for the privilege of owning a company that doesn’t have any killer apps in its stables, then you can line up right behind me, bosmang.

                              <span>Logitech have launched the Aurora Collection, a set of bright, customisable PC gaming peripherals built to be “gender inclusive”. Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.


The G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.

Whatever the project is, ZA/UM’s reference to Shakespeare’s play Hamlet in the job listing certainly suggests they’ll stick with the keen intellect of their last RPG. If you’re not familiar with Disco Elysium’s blend of ideology and role-playing then watch Astrid’s (RPS in Peace) video below.

                              <span>Gotham Knights will finally hit PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC too, in just a few months – Oct. 25 to be exact – and Warner Bros and WB Montreal have been steadily releasing more and more information about the multiplayer Bat-family game. 
Today, as part of IGN First coverage, the studio released the first 16 minutes of Gotham Knights gameplay and the focus is exclusively on Batgirl. If you&#x27;re worried about spoilers, don&#x27;t fret – there&#x27;s not much revealed story-wise in this gameplay, but it does feature a look at the first mission as well as some of the in-game mechanics we&#x27;ll be utilizing to solve mysteries and fight crime. According to the video, this takes place right after the prologue. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


For more about Gotham Knights, be sure to watch this Batgirl-centric trailer and then check out this one detailing some of Robin&#x27;s moveset. After that, check out Game Informer&#x27;s exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s executive producer and director for details about alternate suits, missions, and the Elseworlds-like cooperative play.

I played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I&#x27;m glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR&#x27;s latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

If it&#x27;s like past presentations, we&#x27;ll likely get a trailer or two for the upcoming ninth generation of Pokémon as well as new details regarding the world of these games. I&#x27;m hoping we get a look at the mid-stage evolutions of the starters and more information about the region.

This news comes by way of the official trailer for Andor released today by Disney. Running nearly two and a half minutes long, this trailer sets up the beginning of a rebellion led by Andor and others such as Saw Gerrera and Mon Mothma (all played by the actors that portrayed them in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story).

Elsewhere, Disney also released a fancy new illustrated poster for Andor today:

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. 
One of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. 
“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” 
If you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. 
You’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).
In the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review.

Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet?

Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!

                              <span>Several people on RPS have managed to secure a Steam Deck since Valve&#x27;s handheld starting shipping around five months ago. If you&#x27;re not so lucky, then good news: Valve say they&#x27;re speeding up production and everyone who has currently ordered one should receive their Steam Deck before the end of the year.

                              <span>Minecraft: Java Edition&#x27;s latest update introduced a new player reporting tool, which allows players to submit &quot;inappropriate chat messages or dangerous behaviour&quot; for moderators to review. That seems like a good thing on the its face, but many Minecraft players aren&#x27;t happy that it extends to private servers. 

Naturally, because this is Minecraft, players have changed what they don&#x27;t like. There are now mods which strip messages of information tieing them to your player profile.

I&#x27;ve had a cracking gaming year, and I thinnnk that&#x27;s down to lots of new games? Maybe? This type of question has always brushed over the fact that people play games for years and start &#x27;old&#x27; games all the time, and maybe it&#x27;s less useful than ever now every other game is a live service. But I&#x27;ve had a good gaming year, and that&#x27;s what matters. So what are you playing this weekend? Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re clicking on!

                              <span>SmoothStreams - one of the most reliable and well-known pirate IPTV providers  - suddenly went offline this month. A two-week TorrentFreak investigation has determined that members of MPA-Canada and ACE, including Bell and Rogers, have been tracking the service&#x27;s operators for years. Legal action is already underway, but the process isn&#x27;t going exactly to plan.

                              <span>All of the NFL players in Madden NFL 23 have ratings and you can freely look at them on EA&#x27;s official site. Is Kenny Pickett ranked high enough at a 68? If you don&#x27;t think so, you can call into Madden NFL&#x27;s ratings adjustor hotline (at 689-278-3030) to recommend it go up or down. Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA&#x27;s snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.
Shoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉
July 29, 2022
According to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.
1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯
July 29, 2022
Some NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA&#x27;s involvement.
Tell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...
@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ
July 29, 2022
89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!
#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE

Yo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!
#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X

The hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year&#x27;s ratings. Is there a chance a fan called in with a legitimate change that needs to be made to a player&#x27;s rating? We&#x27;ll have to wait to see, but no matter what, I&#x27;d call the hotline a success as it brought out some laughs.

It’s undeniably a bummer to see a title you’re excited about slip into the following year, but it’s generally for the best to ensure a quality product at release. 2022 has had a growing handful of high-profile setbacks, and we’ve assembled them all in one alphabetized list for a handy reference.

First announced in 2021 with a Spring 2022 launch window, PGA Tour marks EA’s return to making golf games after a years-long hiatus. The publisher nabbed exclusive rights to the Masters Tournament and the game even includes the Ladies Professional Golf Association. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t know much more about the game besides a few courses and events, and EA has on…</span>

                              <span>One of the allures of PC gaming is building your rig to the specs you need. Last year, while I didn&#x27;t pick my components, I built a machine using NZXT&#x27;s streaming PC package, which comes with all the parts you need and a handy guide to walk you through the steps. The build took us about three hours, with only a few hiccups along the way.
If you don&#x27;t want to dedicate time to the build and would rather have someone else put it together, there are plenty of pre-built PC options on the market. One of the newest companies exploring this space is Build Redux, a sister company of Digital Storm, the longtime boutique PC manufacturer.
When you go to Build Redux&#x27;s website, you see the option to build your PC, but not in the way you would expect. You pick your top three games from a preset list of f…</span>

                              <span>Our brief first look at NBA 2K23&#x27;s on-court action shows off the fluidity of play and attention to detail that unfolds even after the whistle is blown. For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.
We&#x27;ll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.
NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix&#x27;s Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA&#x27;s Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan&#x27;s return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.
More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>&quot;A new chapter is about to begin amidst a tangled web of factions.&quot; This line accompanies the latest teaser trailer for Genshin Impact, the incredible free-to-play RPG from miHoYo. The trailer dives into the game&#x27;s fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can&#x27;t dream and worship the God of Wisdom.
Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game&#x27;s other areas.
The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.
All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact&#x27;s 03 update, which doesn&#x27;t have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.
Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</span>

                              <span>In the age of years-long development cycles, it seems miraculous that Wolfenstein 3D, a game that spawned the modern-day FPS as we know it, was developed by six people in just six months. The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.
But that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.

                              <span>After the last stage of my Tour De Jeux gave me a flat tyre on my real bike, I started daydreaming about a bike repair game. A grubby game with fuzzy deductive puzzles as you rule out the many possible causes of similar symptoms. As far as I can find, no such game exists. But I did see two upcoming games with similar names: Bicycle Mechanic Simulator and Bike Mechanic Simulator 2023. Alas, I fear they might be PlayWay-style sims where you just click stuff in order then it all works tickety-boo. That is not the bike repair I know and begrudgingly enjoy.

                              <span>During last year’s Game Awards, Falcon Age developers Outerloop announced Thirsty Suitors, a stylish story-driven RPG about battling your exes and disappointing your parents. Since then, the team have been keeping game details under wraps, but now thanks to the Annapurna Interactive showcase, Outerloop have released a free Steam demo, meaning now we can all have a go at beating the pulp out of our exes - a dream come true. 
You play as Jala, a young woman who just got booted out of her shared apartment after having a fight with her, now, ex-partner. With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she&#x27;s killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love?

                              <span>Having given the MultiVersus closed beta a whirl around a month ago, I thought it was a free-to-play Smash Bros-like that came out swinging. And now I&#x27;ve returned to the open beta phase of the multiverse where Bugs Bunny and Taz The Tazmanian Devil are joined by... Lebron James?! Honestly, my thoughts remain largely unchanged – which is a good thing! It&#x27;s a fun free-to-play fighter that iterates on the Smash formula but can&#x27;t quite emulate its predecessor&#x27;s polish.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a set of Unreal assets that Alice of Bees once described as &quot;angry playmobil&quot;. I&#x27;ve wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.
It&#x27;s actually two games, and I&#x27;m not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who&#x27;s inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you&#x27;re swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.

Looking back, it was a good year for PC gaming, with the release of Valve&#x27;s Orange Box alone giving us three new stone-cold classics to enjoy. But what other games from the year of our Horace deserve to be preserved and saved above everything else? Find out which games made the cut below.

                              <span>For several weeks, a Nier: Automata player has caused intrigue and excitement by posting mysterious images and videos from an area no one had seen before. Was it a secret area? An unfinished area? A hoax? Viral marketing? A mod? If it was a mod, it was far more complex than any so far. Turns out, that&#x27;s because a group of fans have secretly been making their own mod tools, and plan to release them soon. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve enjoyed pranksters memeing on the mystery by creating secret churches in other games, including Half-Life 2 and Super Mario 64.

It was previously aiming to release in September, but in an update on Twitter the developers say Darktide will now launch on November 30th. 

The upside is that they&#x27;re going to run technical tests and betas before the full release, and you can sign-up to participate now.

There was some fresh gameplay for Thirsty Suitors and Hindsight, plus a newly revealed game from Wilmot’s Warehouse devs Hollow Ponds. We were treated to a few glimpses at what Kentucky Route Zero team Cardboard Computer and If Found… devs Dreamfeel are working on too. The latter involves cats.
Don’t fret if you didn’t catch the Annapurna Interactive stream today, because we’ve got all the info you need to know right here. Read on!

                              <span>It was announced during E3 2022 that honey-I-shrunk-the-survival-game Grounded would leave early access and hit version 1.0 this September. An update on Twitter earlier today offered info on what the final early access update, which enters public testing today, has in store for players.

Today, A Better Ubisoft offered an update in which they say that none of their demands have been met and reiterate what they want.

                              <span>SATA SSDs are getting increasingly affordable, with even capacious 2TB models going down in price rapidly as NVMe drives approach parity with the slower SATA drives. This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can&#x27;t accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. 
Today, Teamgroup&#x27;s imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. 
Note that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to &#x27;join Prime to save $32 on this item&#x27;. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s G15 is one of the most affordable gaming laptops on the market, thanks to modest specs and Dell&#x27;s willingness for aggressive discounts, but today we&#x27;re seeing an RTX 3050 model go for an astoundingly low £441. 
To get this price, select the Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS operating system and use VOUCHERCODES8 at checkout. Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you&#x27;re free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!

                              <span>Goats. Why do they exist, and what makes them so loud? Goat Simulator 3 might not answer these deep questions when it bursts onto PC on November 17th, but you can bet it’ll make a lot of noise anyway. Watch the trailer below for a sneaky peek at what&#x27;s next for the wacky even-toed ungulates.

                              <span>Alice is away this week, leaving the lads to their own devices to discuss the best nice blokes in video games. A coincidence? Who can say. What isn&#x27;t a coincidence is the lateness of this here podcast post, which is a week late. That&#x27;s my bad, folks, which I think automatically disqualifies me from any kind of &#x27;nice&#x27; list from here on out. Ah well. You win some, you lose some.  
The winners in this week&#x27;s edition of The Electronic Wireless Show, however, are numerous. Taking that nice engineer chap from Metro Exodus as the absolute pinnacle of &#x27;best nice bloke-ness&#x27;, Nate and Matthew have framed this week&#x27;s episode as the four people they&#x27;d most like to invite to an afternoon pub trip. Who will make the cut? Listen to find out.

                              <span>I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.


Admittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.

                              <span>The world’s greatest detective who isn’t Batman will once again tangle with the many-tentacled forces of darkness in an upcoming remake of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It serves as a sequel of sorts to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One, although they’re calling it a “full remake and substantial rewrite” of the original. There isn’t a trailer just yet, so feel free to anticipate that while you refresh your memory of exactly who Sherlock Holmes is by watching one for Chapter One below.

                              <span>The Sims 4 High School Years is launching today, but its release looks set to be overshadowed by a couple of major bugs introduced by its supporting update, Patch 132. The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you&#x27;ve played The Sims 4 since then, you&#x27;ll have automatically downloaded it unless you&#x27;ve been playing offline. While the patch&#x27;s release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.

                              <span>I really appreciate when games don&#x27;t hold your hand. They don&#x27;t waste time insulting your intelligence, they just set you loose in their playground. They let you strike out on your own, figure things out for yourself, and create something valuable with your own two paws.
Bear And Breakfast doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. It wraps you up in a gigantic bear hug, and refuses to let you out of its smothering embrace until long after your enthusiasm has evaporated.

Minecraft’s 1.19.1 update released yesterday, but its introduction of a player reporting tool has been worrying players since the update went into pre-release in June. While you’re pondering the future of Minecraft, you can watch a really awkwardly timed, tongue-in-cheek video from Mojang below.

And in replacement of his partner John Watson, there was instead a plump hippo in a dapper suit who is constantly quaffing tea. No, you&#x27;ve not accidentally picked up the famous detective’s opium huffing habit, these two curious characters are Sherlock and Watson’s animal counterparts in zoological adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates.
The plucky duo, gentleman giraffe Lord Winklebottom and Doctor Frumple the hippo, have been invited to a mysterious island to sit in on a special announcement only to arrive and, by George! There’s been a bleeding murder!

                              <span>ISP Bright House and several music companies go to trial next week. In preparation, a Florida federal court has set some rules for what can and what can&#x27;t be brought up before the jury. Among other things, the ISP is allowed to argue that terminating accounts of persistent pirates is disproportional. However, the ISP can&#x27;t freely argue that Internet access is a human right.

                              <span>Following an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, five people have been charged with distributing pirate IPTV services. RCMP officers raided GaloTV (Soltv) in 2021, seizing hundreds of set-top boxes, receivers and broadcasting devices. One of the men was previously sued by DISH and agreed to settle a civil suit for more than half a billion dollars.

                              <span>Annapurna Interactive concluded its showcase today by debuting The Lost Wild, Great Ape Games dinosaur-laden survival game.
The Lost Wild was first announced last October with a pre-alpha trailer and is described as a first-person survival horror game. Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. 


Players can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. 
According to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025. It has been confirmed for PC via Steam but will also come to unspecified consoles.</span>

                              <span>Keita Takahashi, the creator of the Katamari series, has a new game in the works. Unfortunately, it’s tough to know exactly what it is.
A teaser trailer premiered during today’s Annapurna Showcase showed a few seconds of close-up footage of an animated child snoring in his sleep. What does it mean? Your guess is as good as ours, but we fully expect it to be weird given Takahashi’s history.


Takahashi’s last big title was the colorful Wattam, released in 2019 and published by Annapurna. This new title looks to continue the relationship between the two partners.</span>

Or a bald man cackling as he kicks you down a hole. And, of course, the tricky boss fights with deformed dragons and Fell Omens from the West Country.
Since I&#x27;ve been playing Monster Hunter Rise, which is largely a succession of ever escalating boss fights with big lizards, I&#x27;ve begun comparing these scuffles with Elden Ring&#x27;s boss battles. And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.
