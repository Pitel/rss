                              <span>&#x27;Tis the season to bust out all of your grodiest games and get to bloody work. One of October&#x27;s haunting hallmarks is Namco&#x27;s Splatterhouse series, from the 1988 arcade classic to the overlooked 2010 reboot. Don&#x27;t let one of the series&#x27; most charming entries pass you by, though. Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti is a chibi-style take on the gore-soaked side-scroller, and it&#x27;s the perfect game to blaze through at devilishly fast speeds this Halloween. 


Whether you&#x27;re just getting into speedrunning or looking for something new to tackle, it&#x27;s important to find the right starting point. Wanpaku Graffiti is a short and sweet game with just the right amount of challenge and memorization. It&#x27;s pretty easy overall, but it&#x27;s one of those games that can end just as quickly with a few hasty mistakes…</span>

                              <span>Paradox Interactive and Harebrained Schemes have announced that the two companies will be parting ways. This comes after Paradox expressed disappointment with the performance of The Lamplighters League. Paradox had acquired the company in 2018.


This is all kind of shocking to me, simply because it doesn’t seem like that long ago that Harebrained Schemes was acquired. However, following the launch of The Lamplighters League, Paradox said that they’d be taking a write-down on the production, as they don’t expect to recoup the development costs. Destructoid’s own Steven “Big Lifter” Mills has a pretty great write-up of that here.


Charlotta Nilsson, CCO of Paradox said, “We and HBS’ leadership have been discussing what would happen after the release of The Lamplighters League, but a new pr…</span>

                              <span>Well, I didn&#x27;t have this one on my Season of Blood bingo card. Season 2 of Diablo 4 was supposed to launch, well, 10 minutes or so ago. Instead, Blizzard released a post on their forums announcing that some technical issues have popped up with the current build. According to the post, they anticipate the delay of Season 2 to be &quot;by a few hours&quot; while they remedy the issues.




Blizzard&#x27;s definition of a few hours have varied between like one hour and several days in the past. Hopefully, it&#x27;s on the shorter side today.


Wait, who do I blame now? Microsoft? Bobby Kotick still? Just kidding. Mostly.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, launches soon™ on all platforms.

The first time Phasmophobia’s console version was delayed was due to an office fire. Kinetic Games’ post suggests that their new release date of October was a little too ambitious. They state that the latest delay is due to issues adapting after the fire.


“As we still try to adapt to our new remote working life after the fire incident and to establish a new office, we&#x27;ve encountered unforeseen challenges in adapting the game for consoles. These combined factors have affected our development timeline more than we initially anticipated.”

                              <span>Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach has posted a short teaser for his upcoming film adaptation of Iron Lung, a 2022 horror game from David Szymanski. According to Fischbach, who is directing, writing, and starring in the adaptation, it&#x27;s  “coming soon to theaters”. A nice surprise for fans used to his work launching as YouTube exclusives. 


In the teaser, which features music by Andrew Hulshult and narration by JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure voice actor Mick Lauer, we see what is presumably the main character emerging from a sea of blood and ominous lightning. 




Fans of Fischbach (and, by extension, listeners of his podcast Distractible) will note that he recently went to the hospital on his birthday because he went “too deep in the blood.” The stunt resulted in his eyes turning a worrying shade of red. It was clear at the time that it was related to the production of Iron Lung, but now the teaser makes it clear it&#x27;s most likely the cause of that incident.


Iron Lung is “a short horror game where you pilot a tiny submarine through an ocean of blood on an alien moon,” according to developer and publisher David Szymanski, known for works like DUSK, Chop Goblins, and Squirrel Stapler. Fischbach announced a film adaptation in April, and fans have received periodic behind-the-scenes updates both via YouTube and Distractible.


Destructoid’s Zoey Handley had this to say about Iron Lung: “It’s a brilliant approach to the horror genre. It keeps you feeling perpetually vulnerable. There is nothing to help you and absolutely no escape. Your only option is to keep pressing ahead, as there’s no rescue until the job is done. Don’t get distracted, ignore the sounds. Hurry, but be careful not to bash into a wall. I don’t think it’s possible to represent that idea better in an interactive medium. Iron Lung really is the perfect short-form horror experience.”

                              <span>Systemic Reaction has announced that they have canceled further development on their multiplayer dinosaur FPS, Second Extinction, and has removed it from sale on marketplaces. Servers are set to close down for it in 2024.


Second Extinction entered Early Access in October 2020, and never really left. The initial goal was to fully launch late last year, but that got delayed due to “critical issues.” After assessing things, the team has decided just to drop it and move on.


“Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets and exit Early Access and Game Preview, and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear. After evaluating our options and working during this year to find other potential solutions, this became the reality our team had to face.”


Interestingly, Systemic Reaction is part of Avalanche Studios Group, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Nordisk Film. If we take them by their word, then that must be one hell of a corner they painted themselves into.


Every cloud, I guess


While the cancellation of a game that people have already paid for is pretty crappy, there is one silver lining here:


“Although this isn’t the outcome any of us hoped for, we want to assure you that there are no layoffs associated with this decision.”


Ideally, studios should be able to make mistakes and be able to turn around from it. It’s just not a great look when the expense is all on their supporters. The developer doesn’t really have the best track record to begin with, having made Generation Zero and Ravenbound, neither of which got the best reception. Perhaps that’s part of the decision to can Second Extinction.


Nonetheless, there’s always a chance for a developer to turn things around, and here’s hoping that Systemic Reaction can do just that and gain back the trust of the supporters who might feel burned by this cancellation.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not been a great launch for Payday 3. As well as experiencing issues with matchmaking, the new entry in the bank-robbing FPS has also had its first major patch delayed. Now, the developer has issued yet another apology, saying that the anticipated update needs &quot;additional time.&quot;


Over on Twitter, the official Payday 3 account apologized to fans for the &quot;lack of communication regarding the first patch.&quot;. Starbreeze Studios says it&#x27;s found more issues to rectify before the patch launches. 




An additional post underneath notes due to the additional time needed to tend to the game, the studio can&#x27;t provide an ETA on when fixes will launch just yet. A third tweet adds a suffix to this apology, saying that both the patch and some more news are inbound. We just don&#x27;t know when.


Maybe it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end


While the studio did do some maintenance to make Payday 3&#x27;s matchmaking better, one of the major criticisms with the game is the always-online feature. This means that even if you want to play a solo campaign, you&#x27;re still required to connect to the server.


However, there is a possibility that an offline mode could come to the game. In a previous post on Twitter/X, the team said that, because of server issues at launch, &quot;we are discussing every option available to us, including offline mode.&quot;


Hopefully, Payday 3 will eventually become the game fans want it to be. At the moment, it has a &quot;Mixed&quot; review score on Steam, with more than a few unhappy customers. Starbreeze has a chance to turn things around, though.

                              <span>Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to know what to make of Twitch. On the one hand, the streaming platform is experiencing peak viewership, but on the other, the company is reportedly laying staff off. Still, it&#x27;s business as usual, and it looks as though the Amazon-owned company now wants a slice of that social media pie.


In a recent blog post, Twitch announced the introduction of stories to its app. Those who regularly use Facebook or Instagram will already be familiar with this feature. Essentially, Twitch has &quot;made it easier for you to reach your community directly on Twitch, through short posts that expire in 48 hours.&quot;




This appears to be a work-in-progress and will have &quot;more features in the coming months&quot;. And given Twitch&#x27;s reputation for being a hotbed of hatred and general toxic behavior, safety measures are factored into stories &quot;in a way that fosters a safe space for you and your community.&quot;


Not available for everyone yet, though


However, the post does make it clear that this feature is not rolling out to all users just yet. For now, they&#x27;re &quot;currently limited to Partners &amp; Affiliates who have had at least one stream in the last 30 days.&quot;


There are plans to make it available to eligible users by the end of the week. However, streamers will need to &quot;meet the minimum eligibility requirements.&quot; There&#x27;s always a catch with these things.


Whatever you think about the new feature, it seems Twitch is looking to keep its head above water by rolling out additional bells and whistles. It could be a neat way for content creators to stay in touch when not live. Equally, it could be another headache in an era already swamped by social media.

                              <span>Just in time for the holidays, Whitethorn Games and Gameous have announced that Lake: Season&#x27;s Greetings will launch on November 15, 2023.


Season’s Greetings is a prequel chapter of the small-town slice-of-life game Lake. Set before the events of the base game, you’re dropped in Providence Oaks as protagonist Meredith’s father, Thomas Weiss. He was previously an offscreen character in Lake, but now will get to color in the backstory with his own point of view. It’s 1985 in a small town, and that’s sort of relaxing. Let’s rent some horror and shove it into the VHS player.




Not only that, but, as the title implies, the town is completely cloaked in snow. Thomas is delivering packages during the height of the holidays, which probably means Christmas music. I can’t say I’m down for that because I have a lot of trauma from working in retail for a couple of holidays. It might be even worse than that pop country in the base Lake.


I felt pretty lukewarm about Lake back when I reviewed it. This was mostly because I felt that the narrative really thought you should love small towns and look down on the busy lives of urban dwellers. I grew up in a rural area, and while it has its comforts, it’s not all fresh apple pie and how-do-you-dos.


On the other hand, I love a good holiday game and am often interested to see if a developer takes feedback into account when revisiting a concept. November might be a busy month, but maybe I’ll be able to fit in another visit to Providence Oaks.


Lake: Season&#x27;s Greetings launches on November 15, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                              <span>Set and primed to release on October 24, the new Cities: Skylines game might launch with some potentially big problems, according to the developer. As per Colossal Order&#x27;s latest announcement, the studio has decided to hit its targeted release date even though this means launching with less-than-stellar optimization. In other words, early adopters of the long-anticipated city-builder may end up struggling to run the game properly on day one.


This information comes from Colossal Order&#x27;s recent forum announcement, where the post states: &quot;Cities: Skylines II is a next-gen title, and naturally, it demands certain hardware requirements. With that said, while our team has worked tirelessly to deliver the best experience possible, we have not achieved the benchmark we targeted.&quot; It&#x27;s really not…</span>

                              <span>If you thought we were done talking about Starfield mods, think again. One of the great things about PC gaming (typically) is the ability to tinker with vanilla releases. In this case, one person has taken Bethesda&#x27;s sci-fi RPG and injected a dose of Doctor Who.


Over on Nexus Mods, user xShadowBlitzz has brought the iconic Daleks to Starfield, replacing the sanitation mini bots that scuttle about the place.

From the description, this mod is currently a work-in-progress, featuring three textured Daleks so far. It also looks as though they don&#x27;t have their sound effects yet, but they could be coming in a future update.


Are we bored with Starfield yet?


There&#x27;s no denying that there&#x27;s a lot to see in the game, but the newest IP from the Skyrim studio already feels like it&#x27;s dropped off the radar a tad. Its hype was all too real, with the game becoming one of the most successful launches of this console generation.


It&#x27;s too early to say at this stage, but some may be wondering whether it will outlast the likes of TES5. The 2011 fantasy RPG has somehow kept itself in the limelight (probably helped by all those re-releases). Some of this longevity can be attested to the modding community.


Whether Starfield will be able to boast such a legacy more than ten years from now cannot be said. However, if Bethesda keeps on top of things with new content and bug fixes (look it up, Todd), it could stand the test of time. Also, mods. More mods will probably help.

                              <span>Adobe Flash is, of course, dead. It was deprecated back in 2021, putting a scruffy little bow on this particular niche of PC gaming. Line Rider, Happy Wheels, and Bloons all started their careers via Flash, and while some of these games do make a return every so often, as the upcoming Alien Hominid remaster, they&#x27;ve certainly fallen out of favour with the younger crowd.


Now, even though Newgrounds continues to exist, the legendary Adobe Flash content repository is not nearly as culturally relevant today as it once used to be. That is not to say, however, that Flash games have been totally taken out of the equation. Notably, Flash developer Mateusz Skutnik - whose name may ring a bell for the older folks - has just released an all-new entry in his Submachine puzzle series. This is, of cou…</span>

                              <span>Steam Next Fest ran from October 9 to 16, and during this week, there were several demos to try out and new information revealed by developers. For anyone interested in knowing what the future of PC gaming holds, it was an event to pay attention to. 


Steam revealed the 50 most played demos during October&#x27;s Next Fest. Plenty of calming, meditative games made the cut including Don&#x27;t Nod&#x27;s climbing game Jusant, thatgamecompany&#x27;s Sky, and Helder Pinto&#x27;s Europa. 


Though there are plenty of indie titles, the list also features some demos from bigger games such as Nacon&#x27;s Robocop and 505 Games&#x27; Ghostrunner 2. There was also plenty of space for strange titles to find some attention. The macabre Crime Scene Cleaner makes the list, as well as the FMV game Love is All Around.

                              <span>Developed by Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio, and released on September 18, Lies of a P is a soulslike that has managed to stand out in its oversaturated genre by offering a unique take on Carlo Collodi&#x27;s The Adventures of Pinocchio. Developers have revealed that the game has already sold a million copies globally. 




This achievement comes with relatively good critical acclaim, and it currently has &quot;Very Positive&quot; user reviews on Steam. Commenting on the milestone in a press release, Neowiz CEO Seungchul Kim stated that &quot;this incredible milestone for Lies of P proves the potential of Korean console games on the global stage.&quot;


Both South Korean studios should be very proud of their success, though it did not come easily, and Kim reveals that &quot;the Lies of P project was a challenging endeavor for Neowiz and Round8 Studio.&quot; There were also a few minor controversies along the way, including the removal of an anti-cop sign in the game. 


Developers are just beginning to enjoy the fruits of their labor, as the game has also received some notable award show nominations. This includes a &quot;Best Visual Design&quot; nomination at this year&#x27;s Golden Joystick Awards ceremony.

                              <img src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/alan-wake-woods.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>It’s almost time for Alan Wake 2, but if you haven’t played the original (or if you’d like to replay it before you jump into the sequel) you can get Alan Wake, as well as seven other spooky games, for $13. 


This deal is part of Humble Bundle’s “Fright of Your Life” bundle. The proceeds of this month&#x27;s bundle go to support International Medical Corps and Direct Relief. If you pay at least $13, you can add STASIS: Bone Totem, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Bendy and the Dark Revival, Alan Wake Collector’s Edition, Hidden Deep, Tormented Souls, Pathologic 2, and Moons of Madness to your library on Steam.


Plus, it&#x27;s the Alan Wake Collector’s Edition. This version includes not only the base game but also a pair of special episodes called “The Signal” and “The Writer.&quot; There&#x27;s also developer commentary, an illustrated PDF book, and a soundtrack with nearly an hour of fully mastered audio tracks composed by Petri Alanko, Old Gods of Asgard, and Poets of the Fall. 


It’s just in time for the sequel, Alan Wake 2, on October 27 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via the Epic Games Store. The game&#x27;s director, Sam Lake, also recently confirmed his plans for free DLC at this year&#x27;s EGX. That is to say, catch up now before your Alan Wake to-do list grows too long. 


In addition to experiencing (for the first time, no less) the Pacific Northwest adventures of Alan Wake, being able to add both games in the Bendy and the Ink Machine duology to my library makes this bundle one I don’t want to pass up. I still haven’t been able to play Bendy and the Dark Revival, so this might be my best opportunity.

If you have ever thought even remotely deeply about the reality of the Super Mario universe (which we wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing, seriously), then you might have bumped up against the most simple of questions: why does Mario get hurt when a Goomba hits him? As it turns out, this is something that Miyamoto was asked back in the days of the NES, and only with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, has Nintendo managed to visualise the reason.
According to a new &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27; interview that Nintendo has published today, Miyamoto&#x27;s answer back then was because the Goombas bite Mario on impact (at least, that&#x27;s the way that Wonder&#x27;s art director, Masanobu Sato remembers it), and so the Wonder developers decided to add an animation into the upcoming platformer to make this statement a reality.

It takes a lot to make a game about giant robot battles feel dull, but somehow Front Mission 2: Remake manages it. While it improves on some of the shortcomings of Front Mission 1st: Remake, the combat system isn’t fun enough to fully salvage this tactical RPG. While it might be worthwhile for strategy fans eager to test out G-Craft&#x27;s 1997 PlayStation game that never got released outside of Japan, we can’t see Front Mission 2: Remake offering much to anyone else.
It’s a shame that the actual combat in Front Mission 2: Remake is so frustrating because the story is much improved over the previous entry. You control a group of soldiers who find themselves on the losing side of a coup and are trying to flee the nation of Alordesh. Warfare in this setting takes place almost exclusively in Wanzers, which are highly customisable mechs of varying levels of effectiveness depending on how you outfit them.

Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 received a surprisingly under-the-radar release date announcement last month of 3rd November, however, it seems that the fighter sequel requires a little more time to warm up before it steps into the ring. The development team has today announced that this release date has been pushed back to 7th November for digital releases and 1st December for physical.
The delay was announced via the official @NickBrawlGame Twitter account, with a message that states the reason for this delay is to allow the development team to &quot;put the finishing touches&quot; on the title — fair enough, we&#x27;d say.

We are just days away from the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on Switch and, as has become something of a tradition, Nintendo has today released the first two parts of an all-new &#x27;Ask the Developer&#x27; interview series about the upcoming game.
The conversation covers a range of topics including how the team settled on the theme of &#x27;wonder&#x27; and the changes that have been made to the game&#x27;s visuals and sound design, but one section that immediately stood out to us was all about the influence that Illumination&#x27;s The Super Mario Bros. Movie had on the game. You might assume that the film&#x27;s forecasted success (remember, both were in development around the same time) would have weighed heavily on the developer&#x27;s minds, potentially even influencing the bros. new game designs; but, as it turns out, this was not the case.

In case you missed it, our pals over at Time Extension recently covered Analogue&#x27;s next big retro venture: an FPGA-based N64 console with 4K output called the &#x27;Analogue 3D&#x27;.
Now, in an extended interview from Paste Magazine (thanks, VGC), Analogue&#x27;s CEO Christopher Taber has claimed that not even Nintendo could match up to what Analogue is aiming to achieve with its new product - even if the former were to create an official &#x27;N64 Classic&#x27; - stating that “The nature of how  software emulation functions with even the most powerful components–it isn’t possible. It will inevitably result in a subpar experience.”

Nintendo UK has launched a new competition to mark the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and this one is all about spotting some special Mario-themed buses around London.
Revealed in a tweet yesterday, NUK announced that there is a Mario Wonder prize pack (consisting of a t-shirt, pin pack diorama, Talking Flower figure and more) available for the winner and all that you need to do is take a picture of one of the special Mario buses that are currently touring around London and post it to Twitter with the relevant hashtag. There is a bus for Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad and Yoshi, so you would use #MarioBus, #LuigiBus, #PeachBus etc. depending on which one you are lucky enough to see.

                              <span>&quot;It is a complete scam&quot;.
If you cast your mind back to the summer, you might remember the leak and later reveal of Skull Island: Rise of Kong, a third-person &quot;action-adventure game&quot; from publishers GameMill Entertainment set to release in the busiest week of the Switch&#x27;s 2023 calendar (which is today, 17th October, if you&#x27;re wondering). Well, with the title now available to pick up, it appears that the packed release date should have been the least of our worries.
We weren&#x27;t expecting a lot from Kong&#x27;s latest foray into the gaming world (2005&#x27;s catchily-titled Peter Jackson&#x27;s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie on the GameCube is quite enough for us, thank you very much), but what we have seen today is unexpectedly hilarious. Several players who were unfortunate enough to pick up Skull Island have taken to Twitter to share some gameplay footage and the results are... something else.

If you’d have told us that two of gaming’s most iconic rivals, Mario and Sonic, would be going head-to-head with two brand-new platformers in the space of a week, we’d have said you were probably off your rocker. What’s more, if you’d have said that Sega’s latest entry, Sonic Superstars, would turn out to provide one of the strongest Sonic campaigns ever created, well quite frankly, we’d be pinching ourselves to double-check that we weren’t dreaming.
Yet here we are, folks. Sonic Superstars is here and it’s an absolute belter. It successfully blends the classic 2D gameplay formula from Sonic’s retro outings (with a big help from Sonic Mania’s physics system) with a modernised visual aesthetic, all the while introducing a handful of brand-new elements that, while not groundbreaking in their execution, are fun little extras that feel destined to evolve in future entries. For a while, it felt like Sonic Team was treading water with its side-on Sonic entries, but developer Arzest has delivered a game that gives Sega’s mascot a kick in the right 2D direction.

Sonic&#x27;s new 2D adventure, Sonic Superstars, is finally here. The game has released on multiple platforms today, so the choice of where to play is all yours — what a treat! Some of you may already be tucking into the blue blur&#x27;s latest (and we can&#x27;t say that we blame you), but if you have been waiting to see how the console versions stack up against each other, then gosh, do we have the video for you.
The good folks over on the YouTube channel GameXplain have put together a graphics comparison for the Switch and the PS5 so you can check out the visual discrepancies between the two. The video provides both a wipe and side-by-side comparison, so you can really get a feel for how the game runs (heh heh) on both consoles.

There&#x27;s some big news coming out of Elder Scrolls and Fallout creator Bethesda, with the head of publishing Pete Hines calling time on his long-running career at the company.
After 24 years of leadership, Hines is retiring and will begin an &quot;exciting new chapter&quot; of his life to explore other interests and passions.

                              <span>Another big Nintendo Switch exclusive has leaked way ahead of schedule. With early copies of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the handheld hybrid console’s big holiday 2023 release, already making the rounds online, modders have taken it upon themselves to make the new talking Talking Flowers in the game curse Mario off.

                              <span>CD Projekt RED&#x27;s Colin Walder, engineering director for management and audio, has shared a few thoughts on how the Polish developer&#x27;s next Witcher RPG, codenamed Polaris, will improve on the cataclysmic development of Cyberpunk 2077. There&#x27;s not a lot to share at this stage, of course, but what there is sounds like a step in the right direction.

                              <span>Having dipped into some deathmatches in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&#x27;s beta over the weekend, I have come to the conclusion that - surprise! - it&#x27;s more Call Of Duty! But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer&#x27;s decision to mash some of COD&#x27;s previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.
Despite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can&#x27;t help but feel it&#x27;s one trembled with nerves. MW3&#x27;s beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there&#x27;s definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.

                              <span>The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed &quot;at least&quot; half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That&#x27;s according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.
It&#x27;s terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn&#x27;t bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you&#x27;d expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.

                              <span>&quot;I am most moved and always have been by stupid courage — the kind when, against all odds, the hero just keeps going,&quot; William Goldman once said. This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.

Stupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red&#x27;s first-person RPG seems to admire, but that&#x27;s never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.

                              <span>David Moralejo Sánchez&#x27;s Outpath, a blend of island base-building game and idle clicker, is now out on Steam with a launch discount and a rapidly growing sackful of positive reader reviews. The gist, for those who missed out on the demo: you walk around small islands punching resources out of the landscape, building crafting stations and dwellings, and slowly amassing the means to access other islands. Or, you ignore all that, and treat the whole thing as an idle clicker, with no time limit and no real opportunity to fail.

                              <span>Epic have dropped a bunch of details as to planned improvements for the Epic Games Store in the on-going race to out-Steam Steam - the Coca-Cola to Epic&#x27;s Pepsi Max. Amongst other things, we can expect more robust search features, support for third-party subscriptions, better EGS launcher performance, a download manager with improved controls, and a new &quot;for you&quot; personalisation tab - all of that rolling out across 2024 and 2025.


Naturally, Epic will be continuing with their free games program through &quot;2023 and beyond&quot;, and they&#x27;ve also put together a couple of special publishing offers for developers, Epic First Run and Now on Epic, which are designed to lure more studios from the amoeba-like embrace of Valve&#x27;s gaming empire.

                              <span>The Alt Controller showing at EGX this year was properly top tier stuff. There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. 
Case in point, there were two games from this year&#x27;s cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection&#x27;s long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here&#x27;s a little look at both of them in action.

The pair, who were tracked down through PayPal records and IP-addresses, are also on the hook for 489 million euros in piracy damages. One of the defendants, a Ukrainian sysop living in Sweden, informs TorrentFreak that he will appeal the judgement.

                              <span>Earlier this year, dozens of news outlets amplified the erroneous conclusion that 1,000 homes in the UK were receiving police visits for suspected involvement in IPTV piracy. This week, Sky and anti-piracy group FACT reported a similar operation using clear and unusually specific language. That&#x27;s a welcome change; back in January, police forces all over the UK were instructed not to discuss visit numbers due to fears that the deterrent effect would be watered down.

Alan Wake: Flashback might help, though, as it&#x27;s a new Unreal Editor for Fortnite experience that gives players the chance to relive the mysteries and events of the first Alan Wake, albeit presumably in a much shorter and more streamlined fashion. 
Epic Games says Alan Wake: Flashback is based on the first Alan Wake game and reimagines Remedy&#x27;s 2010 action-thriller in Fortnite. &quot;Troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest to…</span>

Hot on the heels of Mortal Kombat 1&#x27;s launch, NetherRealm is already exploring new corners of the Mortal Kombat universe through a new mobile title, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught.

                              <span>With the launch of Season 2, Season of Blood, Diablo 4 will be running another Twitch Drop campaign. This specific campaign takes place over four weeks and will reward viewers with various Oricalchum cosmetics. Each week a separate cosmetic is obtainable, with viewers having to watch four hours total of anyone in the Diablo 4 category on Twitch in order to obtain the drop.

Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop Schedule


Here is the complete schedule for the Diablo 4 Season 2 Twitch Drop campaign over the next four weeks:


Week 1: Twitch Drops for Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer



Start Time: October 17, 10 a.m. PDT


End Time: October 24, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Cosmetic: Oricalchum Blade Item Cosmetic



Week 2: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Druid



Start Time: October 24, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: October 31, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Mallet Item Cosmetic



Week 3: Twitch Drops for Barbarian and Necromancer



Start Time: October 31, 12 p.m. PDT


End Time: November 6, 11:59 a.m. PDT


Reward: Oricalchum Greatsword Item Cosmetic



Week 4: Twitch Drops for Druid



Start Time: November 6, 12 p.m. PST


End Time: November 13, 12 p.m. PST


Reward: Oricalchum Quarterstaff Item Cosmetic



Overall the Orichalcum cosmetics look pretty clean. They aren&#x27;t flashy or anything, but I kind of prefer that way. Instead, they looked sturdy and intricately laden with Orichalcum, I guess to help slay vampires, which is the theme of the season.


Diablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, begins on October 17 on all platforms.

Guardians of the Dream will release on November 7 and bring with it an all-new zone—The Emerald Dream—a new faction, updates to Dragonriding, new character customizations, and a new public event. And just one week later the new raid, Amirdrassil, will open up for players to challenge. Inside the raid players will find new class tier sets as well as a new legendary weapon called Fyr&#x27;alath the Dream Render. Finally, alongside the raid, a brand new Mythic + Seasonal rotation will begin as well as a new PvP season with a new PvP Brawl Mode called Battleground Blitz.

                              <span>Escape From Tarkov is one of the most complex first-person shooters on the market right now, and it has successfully been holding onto this title for years now. This complexity appeals to many players: from its excessively detailed weapon modification systems to its janky but engaging combat loop, Tarkov delivers the sort of experience that virtually no other FPS has delivered. They&#x27;ve certainly tried, mind. The game&#x27;s appealing complexity, however, goes hand-in-hand with its always-online progression systems, where you&#x27;re always engaging with other players. This, of course, means you&#x27;re always at the risk of losing everything you&#x27;re carrying, which is bound to put many people off.


The game&#x27;s many issues did come to a head with the massive Tarkov cheating scandal from earlier in 2023. Th…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a fan of the Naruto anime, chances are there are a handful of songs that live rent-free in your head. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden have been home to some of the most iconic opening themes, and they&#x27;re on the way to the next game. Bandai Namco announced new DLC for Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections adding five fan-favorite songs along with some in-game items. 


Here&#x27;s a sample, so go ahead and start belting out your best anime theme song karaoke. 




The new in-game items include the Ninja Info Card Skin and two substitution items: Microphone and Orange Headphones. The five featured themes include:



“GO!!!” by FLOW


“Haruka Kanata” by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION


“Blue Bird” by Ikimonogakari


“Silhouette” by KANA-BOON


“Kaze” by Yamazaru



Reliving Naruto history


All of the songs are essentials from the Naruto series, with FLOW&#x27;s &quot;GO!!!&quot; providing the fourth opening theme song for the original. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION&#x27;s &quot;Haruka Kanata&quot; was the second for Naruto, and Ikimonogakari&#x27;s &quot;Blue Bird&quot; was the third for Naruto Shippuden. KANA-BOON&#x27;s &quot;Silhouette&quot; served as Naruto Shippuden&#x27;s 16th OP, and Yamazaru&#x27;s &quot;Kaze&quot; directly followed that act. The series has a ton of themes, and this lineup runs the gamut with some heavy hitters.


The appropriately named The Nostalgic Anime Song &amp; Item DLC will be available for all platforms. It&#x27;s also coming to the limited time Sound Ultimate Bundle, which is a Steam exclusive set that includes the game, season pass, and more. You&#x27;ll be able to play along with these themes when Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections hits consoles and PC on November 17.

According to Gabriel Corrêa&#x27;s Reddit post, they may have discovered a way to improve Forza Motorsport&#x27;s shipped ray tracing capabilities by a fair margin. After snooping through files, Corrêa explained how they pieced together that Motorsport&#x27;s configuration still used low-definition textures even when set to Ultra. Corrêa also shows they fixed the rendition of wheels at extreme speeds, along with other issues discovered combing configuration files. 


&quot;I compared the files in FM with those in FH5 and found these problems,&quot; wrote Corrêa. &quot;512x5…</span>

                              <span>If the debut trailer is anything to go by, chaos is on the menu for Starnaut. Developer Crim announced the spacey adventure for PC, with Early Access to kick off in February 2024. The roguelike action game has you playing as an astronaut on a solo space expedition that lands them in the multiverse. From there you&#x27;ll be blasting &quot;endless incoming enemies&quot; that can be deceptively cute and drop what seems to be an equally endless number of coins. 


Check out a sample of the running, blasting, and frequently exploding gameplay in the debut trailer.




Blaster master


The straightforward story sets up a world in which people launched Omega Rockets containing their memories and history before doomsday struck. The rockets ended up landing in the multiverse, though, so it&#x27;s up to Starnaut to find out if humanity can come back from the brink if all the rockets are returned. More importantly, doing so gives Starnaut an excuse to run around, fire off countless volleys, and collect coins for weapon and suit upgrades.


It all looks like utter madness. There are massive tentacles, floating panda bears, and a bunch of rockets ready to launch. Get all the Omega Rockets flying and launch along with the last one and you&#x27;ll take home the win, it seems. &quot;Those enemies are not only hungry for you but YOUR KNUCKLE SANDWICH!!!,&quot; the description reads. That&#x27;s a powerful bullet point, right there. 


If the name Crim sounds familiar, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s Sawaki Takeyasu&#x27;s company. The director behind 2011&#x27;s El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron previously bought that game&#x27;s rights in 2013, and an HD remaster launched in 2021. Takeyasu is now enthusiastically tweeting about Starnaut, so we&#x27;ll have to see how it shapes up as we get closer to Early Access.

                              <span>Classification is a major endeavor at the Destructoid Insitute for Critiquing Kusoge. Before we can critique, we must first establish what is and what isn’t kusoge. That is to say, a crap game. Even though I am the foremost and sole member at the institute, it can be quite a challenge, as was the case with the Carmageddon series.


Carmageddon has a lot of the facets of kusoge. Each game invariably controls like garbage. Its vehicle physics is detestable. And the mechanics are very loosely tied together and wobbly. However, as I was doing the legwork to establish the series as kusoge, I realized that, while they are concept-first games, they are fun to play under their own merits.


However, there are (at least) two exceptions in the series. The first is Carmageddon 64, which is not only t…</span>

                              <span>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Scythe Dev Team, the developers behind popular creepy restaurant simulator Happy&#x27;s Humble Burger Farm have revealed their new title, Return to Northbury Grove. Those interested in some spooky goodness don&#x27;t have to wait long because the new title is out...well...now. Players can download the free Action Adventure title for free on Steam.




VR Only


It appears VR is required to experience Return to Northbury Grove, as the notice on the Steam page indicates a VR headset is required. For now, it looks like OpenXR, Oculus XR, SteamVr, and WMR are the supported platforms.


In Return to Northburgy Grove, players take on the role of Liam Murphy, an aspiring actor determined to land the role of a lifetime at the infamous Rock the Warehouse music festival. When he gets there though, the concert grounds are desolate and Liam gets kidnapped and thrown into the basement of the Spector Forest Slasher&#x27;s kill-house.


In classic Scythe Dev Team fashion, the visuals and audio are chilling, to say the least. According to the Steam Page, choices matter and can impact your survival in real time. Adaptive AI makes no two playthroughs the same.


I&#x27;m not quite on the VR train just yet, but this is certainly the kind of game meant for VR. It&#x27;s like a slasher horror movie except in VR. After playing HHBF I know that Scythe knows how to nail a creepy atmosphere, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a journey.


Return to Northbury Grove is available now for free on Steam.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.5 launched with the final tier of its Myths of the Realm Alliance Raid earlier this month, and it&#x27;s still packing secrets to discover. The new 24-man raid apparently has a little easter egg for players familiar with the MMO&#x27;s fishing lore, and it involves shooting your shot with one of the realm&#x27;s 12 gods, Llymlaen.


In the Thaleia Raid, if you catch her at just the right time, using the &#x27;/blowkiss&#x27; emote on Llymlaen causes her to stop and scold you. &quot;Oi, cut it out, you!&quot; she chides, before hitting you with True Damage and taking you down to one HP. 




The Japanese FFXIV fan site Umadori first chronicled player encounters with Llymlaen last week. The attack she uses is Navigator&#x27;s Dagger, a fish found in La Noscea, where, you guessed it, Llymlaen is the patron god. The in-game description notes these long, blade-like fish are the &quot;knives thrown by Llymlaen at Her enemies.&quot; The bigger version of that fish, Navigator&#x27;s Brand, adds, &quot;Fishers believe that this wavekin was the blade that Llymlaen threw at Oschon in Her fury at having Her naked form espied.&quot;


Anyway, in the name of science, I tested the FFXIV easter egg myself. I&#x27;m happy to report Llymlaen kicked my ass. Sorry for the uh, messy screenshot. I was a little too antsy about getting the watcher of the seas to stab me to death, so quality wasn&#x27;t top of mind.

I couldn&#x27;t tell you the exact moment I caught her, but I did spam the &#x27;blowkiss&#x27; emote with the chatlog option turned off — didn&#x27;t want to spam the chat. But at some point, I did get her to turn to me, stun my poor Warrior of Light, and take her down to one HP. I was stunned for so long I died, but worth it. I got the kiss and the clear, and now I&#x27;m off to try this on Halone.

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield is a delightful game, for sure, though it&#x27;s not without its faults. Its randomized nature, specifically, has been criticized for how repetitive it can get, with points of interest such as the Spaceship Debris crash site popping up all over the place with virtually no variance in loot or detail. Now, with players spending more and more time in the game, they&#x27;re figuring out that there are ways to deliberately trigger the appearance of certain points of interest, potentially underlining this problem.


Notably, Starfield player and Reddit user sterrre appears to have figured out a way to deliberately spawn Spaceship Debris landing zones on planets: one that is both obvious and interesting, if you think about it, but somehow managed to fly under the radar up until now. Ac…</span>

                              <span>After 24 years at Bethesda, industry veteran Pete Hines has announced his retirement. He explains that he came to this decision after a long and successful career that culminated with the launch of Starfield, and he feels that it is the right time to bow out. 


In his announcement post, he thanked fans for all their support over the years. It&#x27;s not quite clear yet whether he is fully exiting the industry, as he says that he will now spend his time &quot;exploring interests and passions,&quot; in addition to stating that &quot;this is certainly not goodbye by any means.&quot; 




In response, Bethesda sent Hines a heartwarming Tweet prescribing him plenty of goodies, including lots of gaming, card collecting, and devoting his love and care to foster puppies. It has not yet been revealed who will take his place as Head of Publishing for Bethesda Softworks. 


Bethesda will march forward without Hines, with Todd Howard still serving as the studio&#x27;s executive producer. The studio has a lot on its plate for the future. Starfield DLC is on the way, and Todd has also revealed that The Elder Scrolls 6 is in the works and there are plans for Fallout 5.

                              <span>Analogue has announced the next in their line-up of FPGA-powered console recreations. This time, they’ll be revisiting a personal favorite of mine, the Nintendo 64, with the Analogue 3D.


Analogue is playing it pretty coy with the Analogue 3D. The only thing I have in terms of news is some shadowy images of the hardware and controller and the promise that it will be 100% compatible through the use of FPGA hardware emulation.


This is sort of big news because the N64 has been notoriously hard to emulate accurately. Even Nintendo’s own attempts at software emulation through the Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online haven’t been perfect. Through the use of FPGA they can emulate the hardware, rather than the software environment, ensuring maximum compatibility.


The Analogue 3D will out…</span>

                              <span>The Skyrim modding community continues to be a haven of creativity for those that like messing with Bethesda&#x27;s formula. Want to carry corpses around like you&#x27;re Garret from Thief? Now you can. Want NPCs to break wind? Thy will be done. What about healing your followers mid-battle? That&#x27;s also a possibility.


Thanks to veteran modder JaySerpa over on Nexus Mods, there&#x27;s a way to assist downed companions with a press of a button. Providing you have some potions, you can heal friendly NPCs, rather than waiting for them to recover automatically.




They even come with some lines of dialog for when you help them, as demonstrated in the video above. JaySerpa says the idea for their &quot;Press E to Heal Followers&quot; mod came straight from Starfield, which has a similar feature.


It just won&#x27;t die


Say what you will about Skyrim, it&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving. At least as far as custom content is concerned. Given that we&#x27;re approaching 12 years since the game first released, it&#x27;s actually quite impressive that it&#x27;s stood the test of time.


Okay, it&#x27;s definitely aged at this point, but that&#x27;s where modders like JaySerpa come to the rescue. Over the years, we&#x27;ve seen everything from graphical overhauls to bug fixes to new ways of being immersed incorporated into TES5 by the fan base.


We&#x27;ll never know whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will be able to enjoy such longevity. We still don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s coming out, but so long as the Skyrim community keeps releasing mods, Bethesda&#x27;s 2011 epic won&#x27;t be going anywhere for a while.

                              <span>Morteshka, the developer behind The Mooseman and The Black Book, has shown off their latest horror concoction, One-Eyed Likho, in a new trailer.


Do not adjust your monitor. The 4:3 aspect ratio is a feature of this first-person walking sim horror. One-Eyed Likho is based on the Slavic folklore creature of the same name. The developer describes it as “Likho is an embodiment of evil fate and misfortune in Slavic mythology.”




Not only is One-Eyed Likho in 4:3, but it’s also in greyscale. The latter isn’t entirely uncommon, but the former is pretty rare these days when it comes to 3D titles. But beyond those visual quirks, the game looks rather interesting. There’s some good horror imagery and good use of the game’s darkness. There’s a lot of arson depicted, which is always a plus in my book. Morteshka describes it as “burn mechanics,” which I can get behind. The protagonist also burns their fingers if they hold a lit match for too long, which is something I’ve always wanted to see.


I don’t often intentionally seek out walking simulator games, but I usually enjoy the ones that I play. As a cinematic splinter of the adventure genre, they’re an effective way of telling a narrative. Also, they seem to recognize that you can’t just solve every problem with a gun or even a length of metal pipe, which is something we should all learn.


One-Eyed Likho is currently set to release sometime in 2024. There will be a demo for it from October 26 to November 2, 2023.

                              <span>I love it when game names do what they say on the tin, but I love it even more when they contain hidden depths behind that initial simplicity. Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I&#x27;ve come across in a while. 
Taking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you&#x27;re not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you&#x27;ll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It&#x27;s a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year&#x27;s highlights from EGX&#x27;s Leftfield Collection.

                              <span>Pete Hines, head of publishing at Elder Scrolls, Fallout and Starfield studio Bethesda, is retiring. One of the most public faces at the developer behind perhaps only Toddy H himself, Hines has played a prominent role in the release of their biggest games for close to the last quarter-of-a-century - but says that the “time is right” to move on to “an exciting new chapter of my life”.

                              <span>If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It&#x27;s a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there&#x27;s no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.


Moral Anxiety&#x27;s Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter&#x27;s release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it&#x27;s a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.

                              <span>Newly released documents have given us a rare inside look at how gun manufacturers have tried to use videogames to promote their wares to younger people - specifically, players of Activision&#x27;s original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released in 2009. The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They&#x27;ve been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.

Made by the same team behind 2018&#x27;s Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet. It&#x27;s a little bit 4X-y, but not massively so, and I had a very fun time indeed with its EGX demo over the weekend, which I think I played for almost a solid hour and completely forgot about the growing queue of folks behind me. Sorry about that…

There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.
You click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate. This is Submachine, a 14-part escape puzzle series from Mateusz Skutnik, which Skutnik has now compiled, polished-up and re-released as Submachine: Legacy.

                              <span>Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year&#x27;s Cave &amp; Cliffs update.
The headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game&#x27;s old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by podracing, parrying a grappling hook, seeing your own legs as you parkour about, and heaps more attractive and interesting indie games. Check &#x27;em out!

                              <span>Let me put you at ease. Endless Dungeon is a very splashy, confidently clever roguelike about spannering turrets, hosing bullets, and popping bugs like angry little pimples. It sounds disgusting when I type it out loud like that, so let&#x27;s pivot to the reliable food analogy. It is a delicious game, a hearty stew. A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There. Now that you&#x27;ve been pacified by the imagery of a steaming bowl of pleasing dungeon gumbo, you will forgive the 400 words I have written below about doors.

                              <span>But you need to be &quot;close-by&quot; others to use it.
Pokémon GO developer Niantic has announced and released Party Play, a brand new multiplayer feature that allows you to team up with your friends — as long as they&#x27;re close by.
The feature is live now in Pokémon GO and enables you and up to three friends to party up and play together. Teaming up with friends makes raids much easier, as you have access to a Party power gauge which, when full, doubles the power of your next attack.

This week&#x27;s physical gaming charts for the UK are now in and despite some tasty Amazon Prime Day discounts mixing things up a little, nothing has managed to knock EA Sports FC 24 off the top spot.
The latest not-FIFA title sees its third week in first place (the Switch still only accounts for a small 7% of its total sales) followed by Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage and a surprise resurgence from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Speaking of surprises, the biggest Switch-only game this week is Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, which has managed to hop its way back into fifth place on the charts after benefitting from a hefty Amazon discount for Prime Day — nice!

After being announced for Switch earlier this year, publisher and developer Illfonic has now revealed the Switch eShop page for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed - Ecto Edition which confirms that the creepy co-op ghost-hunter will be heading our way later this week on 19th October.
The game originally launched on PlayStation, Xbox and PC last year, and will see you playing as either Ghostbuster or, well, Ghost, in a series of &#x27;hide and seek&#x27;-style games. It&#x27;s a 4-vs-1 set-up where a group of Proton Pack-wielding protagonists team up to catch an illusive ghoul — think of the Luigi&#x27;s Mansion minigame in Nintendo Land and you won&#x27;t be a million miles away.

Minecraft Live saw a number of exciting announcements for Mojang&#x27;s blocky world. There was update news, live performances, the reveal of the game&#x27;s next mob, but perhaps the most exciting addition came in the shape of a new DLC package from a galaxy far, far away....
The Star Wars: Path of the Jedi DLC will be bringing some Clone Wars action to Minecraft on 7th November. This one will see you playing training to become a Jedi Knight, embarking on missions with some familiar faces (Master Yoda, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you know the drill) and taking on monsters and Sith Lords alike.

Hot Wheels, man. We remember those. In the &#x27;90s almost every Saturday morning ad break featured a Hot Wheels commercial braying out superlative adjectives over thrashy rock solos. Invariably, two pearly-toothed, spiky-haired kids would grin as their miniature cars jostled for pole position, giving each other a thumbs-up after a totally tubular crash. All we ever wanted was a simple orange loop — because the loop was the coolest gravity-defying thing ever — but we never got one because the Super Nintendo was a life priority. We did manage to try one once, though, and pinged that car down the straight at full speed, ripping up the lip, only for it to soar off and go clattering across the ground. While you can still spectacularly succumb to gravity in Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, if you blast the accelerator for all its worth you’ll coast that loop through an elating 360 degrees.
Here, the world of collectible racing cars has been virtually recreated in a splendidly inventive fashion. What’s striking about Unleashed 2 is the creativity that’s been put into its various modes, featuring clever ideas that don&#x27;t just lean on existing tropes, but dig into the fascinating meta of miniature racing within giant, real-world environments.

                              <span>Upon its announcement as the grand finale of the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, Super Mario Bros. Wonder declared the series’ return to the 2D side-scrolling genre with a colorful bang. The game signals the return to Mario’s roots from a core gameplay perspective, but it’s more connected to Mario’s past than most people initially realized. While many remember the creative level design, expressive art style, and discovery of the game-changing Wonder Flowers, the most memorable moment came at the end of the announcement trailer, as everyone’s favorite plumber grabbed a never-before-seen item and transformed into an elephant. That moment told everyone that Super Mario Bros. Wonder, despite taking the series back to its 2D origins, is trying bold, new things unlike anything the franchise has seen before.

As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.
While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart serie…</span>

                              <span>The Analogue Pocket is a retro handheld marvel, capable of playing your favorite Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games on its beautiful screen with modern sensibilities and technology – simply put, it&#x27;s the best way to play a Game Boy game, assuming you can get your hands on the always-sold-out device. Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. 
Analogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it&#x27;s below as well:
An image released alongside today&#x27;s news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: 
Analogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have &quot;4 original-style controller ports,&quot; presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D&#x27;s 4K output allowed &quot;us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,&quot; and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. 
Analogue didn&#x27;t share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it&#x27;s like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). 

While waiting to learn more, read Game Informer&#x27;s Analogue Pocket review.

Being the sequel to two excellent games is not a guarantee of success. But it does set strong expectations. Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in j…</span>

                              <span>The EGX demo for magic school adventure Leximan was perhaps only ten minutes long, but that&#x27;s all it really needed to confirm that this wordy spell-caster is a riotous delight of a thing that should absolutely be on your radar. Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who&#x27;s struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he&#x27;s woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year&#x27;s EGX, I&#x27;ll hold my hands up and say, yep, I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;s been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I&#x27;m pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.

                              <span>When I see dirt, I know what I must do: clean. Whether it&#x27;s in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut&#x27;s appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver&#x27;s handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he&#x27;ll take care of the rest. Sure, it&#x27;s perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut&#x27;s lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed in August that longtime Mario voice actor Charles Martinet would no longer be voicing Mario. Amongst speculation of a different voice actor for Mario in Super Mario Bros. Wonder trailers, Nintendo also announced Martinet was not jumpman&#x27;s voice in the game, leaving fans to wonder who the new voice is. After months of internet sleuthing, guesswork, and more, Nintendo has confirmed that Genshin Impact voice actor Kevin Afghani is the new voice of Mario. 
&quot;The voice actor&#x27;s name is Kevin Afghani,&quot; Nintendo tells Game Informer in a statement.
Afghani celebrated the news with a tweet today about how excited he is to voice both Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Incredibly proud to have voiced Mario and Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Thanks to Nintendo for inviting me into the Flower Kingdom!
October 13, 2023
Afghani&#x27;s credits include Arnold in the aforementioned Genshin Impact, Raditz in Dragon Ball R&amp;R, and Short Detective, General, and Grunt in the Secret History of Cuphead short.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder hits Switch exclusively on October 20.

A scarecrow makes the mistake of turning into a man right before you, a shotgun-toting farmer with the barrel pointed at your face. You greet him with your own shotgun, double-barreled, finger on the trigger.
You eclipse him in a bear hug of bullets and sound. Above you, the sky – already the hue of a bloodhound’s fever dream – is somehow even redder. One moment later, and you’re already gone.
This is Dusk, one of a handful of recent games harkening back to the Doom and Quake era and the invention of the FPS genre itself.

                              <span>Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Sonic Superstars have a lot in common. Both feature 2D gameplay that veers close to the original vision for the franchise. Both offer co-op and competitive multiplayer options. Both deliver modernized visuals. And both give players new gameplay concepts and abilities that expand the original franchise vision in unprecedented ways. However, perhaps the most shocking thing these two games have in common is when they release.
In the 1990s, Sonic the Hedgehog was the sole series able to briefly challenge Mario&#x27;s claim to the platforming throne, and next week may prove the series&#x27; fates are forever intertwined.

                              <span>With Mortal Kombat 1 out in the wild we&#x27;re revisiting the entry that set the series on its current trajectory: 2011&#x27;s Mortal Kombat (aka MK 9). Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game&#x27;s genre-defining story campaign.  
After 2006&#x27;s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise&#x27;s main narrative, 2011&#x27;s entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9&#x27;s cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9&#x27;s story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.
Join editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up.

This means that Activision Blizzard, which is the company behind franchises like Call of Duty and Diablo, is now part of Xbox&#x27;s first-party umbrella. As a result, Xbox&#x27;s stable of IPs and game franchises has become much larger, welcoming the likes of Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and more. 
While many know Activision Blizzard as the company behind industry juggernauts like Call of Duty and Overwatch, the company is home to plenty more games. In light of today&#x27;s news, we&#x27;ve decided to create an easy place to see every Activision Blizzard game franchise that Xbox now owns.

Earlier today, Microsoft officially acquired Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick revealed he will remain as CEO through the end of the year after Xbox head Phil Spencer asked him to stay to help with the company transition. While staying through the end of the year presumes Kotick will depart from the company in 2024, that remained technically unknown.
However, Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier says that Kotick will depart from Activision Blizzard, a company he took over 33 years ago, on January 1, 2024.

                              <span>Sonic Superstars sprints to stores next week, and while I’ve wrapped up the main adventure and partaken in the other activities, such as Battle Mode, one big highlight eludes my evaluation: co-op. 
One of Superstars’ biggest selling points is to take down Eggman with up to three other players. Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …</span>

The CMA was the last hurdle for Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition after it received approval in more than 40 countries and regions, including the U.S. earlier this summer. The deadline for Microsoft to close this deal was October 18, but reports indicated the company was planning to finalize it today, October 13. That has now happened, and Activision Blizzard is officially part of Xbox&#x27;s first-party studio umbrella.
Xbox released the video below to celebrate its acquisition:

                              <span>After the U.K.&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority blocked Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard earlier this year over cloud gaming concerns, Microsoft brought a new deal to the table. In this new deal, Ubisoft would get the rights to Activision Blizzard cloud game streaming in the U.K. for 15 years, theoretically quelling the CMA&#x27;s concerns. The CMA granted Microsoft a preliminary approval last month and now, a few weeks later, the U.K. regulatory agency has finally given Microsoft the full approval it needs. 
With the CMA&#x27;s approval, Microsoft now has everything it needs to close the deal and make Activision Blizzard a part of Xbox&#x27;s first-party umbrella. This approval comes just days before Microsoft&#x27;s October 18 deadline to complete t…</span>

                              <span>The Association of American Publishers has shared its overview of notorious piracy markets with the U.S. Trade Representative. The organization sees shadow libraries, including LibGen and Sci-Hub, as key problems, with the relatively new meta-search engine Anna&#x27;s Archive also getting a mention. Third-party intermediaries pose problems too, the publishers note, with abuse of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as a growing concern.

It seems to be selling well, squatting at third on the platform&#x27;s global top seller charts by revenue, but the user review consensus tells a different story. There are 1,320 reviews at the time of writing, and they are Mostly Negative, which is quite the showing for a game&#x27;s first day on sale.

With over 50 games in this year&#x27;s Rezzed Zone, we certainly haven&#x27;t been spoiled for choice this year, and below we&#x27;ve rounded up a selection of what&#x27;s caught our respective eyes so far, from interstellar trucking sims and neon-drenched cats on skateboards to racing battle royales and dreamy visual novels - some of which you can even play at home right now thanks to some conveniently-timed Steam Next Fest demos.

This is an arcade blasting game through and through, where conscious strategy and placed shots soon shrink into rearview atoms as the pull of the machine gunner takes you and you realise you&#x27;ve been screaming for the last eight seconds. You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers. That are bristling with ramming spikes. Or possibly all of the above.

                              <span>The next game in RGG Studio’s Yakuza/Like A Dragon series, Infinite Wealth, is a melting pot of old and new. As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. 
Alas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who&#x27;s managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.

The total figure for the company behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Hearthstone, to say nothing of whopping mobile game publisher King and Candy Crush Saga? $68.7 billion, making this the biggest buyout in videogames industry history.

Time to get busy, then. The cows need to be milked, the eggs need to be gathered from the chicken coop, the seeds need to be sowed and watered. 


You might find an hour to do a bit of scavenging, here and there - gathering mussels from the rocks at low tide, or putting aside some wood for that pier your dad asked you to build. Just, don&#x27;t forget the gods. The gods have needs too. Today it&#x27;s crabs. Tomorrow? Who knows.

Ubisoft are working on an Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Mirage patch that will let you toggle off chromatic aberration - aka the blurring of outlines and details for artistic effect, which you might consider appropriate to a game subtitled &quot;Mirage&quot;, but which some people absolutely despise.

                              <span>I&#x27;m honestly a little surprised by how much I&#x27;m enjoying Star Trek: Infinite. It is not the ultimate Star Trek strategy game, but nor is it a bog standard 4X strategy in an unfortunate 80s leotard. &quot;Lets you play your own Star Trek story&quot; is a fair summary of what it&#x27;s about, even if the bulk of that story in practical terms is building space stations to claim territory, and filling up planets with farms, cities, and empire-specific labour camps, forums, and whatever hippie garbage the feds have. Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that&#x27;s cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I&#x27;ve enjoyed more the longer I played it.

                              <span>Despite the extremely upsetting news about what nate has been having for breakfast this year, we maintain our composure to deliver an episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast all about the Steam Next Fest, currently running until next Monday the 16th. You&#x27;ve got a whole weekend of free demos to try, and we&#x27;ve knocked back a few to regurgitate into your open mouths as suggestions for what to try first. Plus, we&#x27;ve been playing a few current games, and have some juicy recommendations of non-game things.

                              <span>I was mixed on Dambusters&#x27; Dead Island 2 - I thought the combat had flair but not much depth, loved the game&#x27;s decadently disastrous Los Angeles, but hated how exploration boiled down to nosing around for crafting materials. The game&#x27;s first story DLC expansion, Haus, amps up the weirdness of the environments by transporting you to a &quot;surreal, psycho-horror dreamscape&quot; in blissful Malibu.
There are flashes of Glass Onion and The Menu here, but I was reminded just as much of the eerier parts of Bioshock, that underwater monument to crackpot billionaires with far too much time on their hands. Here&#x27;s a video of the opening.

                              <span>Lords Of The Fallen is a reboot of CI Games and Deck 13&#x27;s 2014 action-RPG called… Lords Of The Fallen. We thought the original was average and largely forgettable, so how does the new LOTF stack up against it nine years later? Well, it&#x27;s definitely going to appeal to more folks by being a fairly enjoyable soulslike that ticks most checkboxes, and that rises above most of the competition by popping a magic lantern in your hands.
Raise a light to the dark fantasy world and it&#x27;ll reveal a more dribbly parallel universe you can warp between at almost any time. This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It&#x27;s not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.

You might say there&#x27;s been an outbreak of Smooth Crime, hee heeee! Sorry, I wish I were cool enough to explain this properly. It&#x27;s probably best you just watch the footage below.

That means we&#x27;ll be tucking into the 50+ indie games that will be there over the coming days, and we can now confirm the full and final line-up of what&#x27;s going to be on the showfloor. Most of these are only playable at the show, but you may still find some of them have demos available on Steam thanks to this week&#x27;s Steam Next Fest. In any case, read on below to come and see what&#x27;s coming up.

                              <span>Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It&#x27;s a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you&#x27;ll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you&#x27;ll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.
But up front it tells you &quot;There are no wrong choices, only your choices&quot; in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about &quot;tracing different pathways&quot; using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about &#x27;seeing everything&#x27; or making sure you get a &#x27;good&#x27; playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It&#x27;s a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn&#x27;t quite come together in the way I&#x27;d hoped.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew breaks down our Lords of the Fallen review and subsequently rips into publishers for naming video game sequels the same name as the original game, like &quot;Lords of the Fallen&quot; instead of &quot;Lords of the Fallen 2.&quot; After, Alex talks about why action puzzler Cocoon nails player feedback, and then we dive into the anals of our 2023 gaming backlog, highlighting releases we want to revisit or play for the first time before Game Informer&#x27;s Game of the Year discussions in December.
Finally, our Listener Questions segment returns, discussing treating carpal tunnel and answering specific questions like, &quot;What happened to the promised 120FPS console releases?&quot;

Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. 
Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – …</span>

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage&#x27;s player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft&#x27;s biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. 
Thank you all for joining us on Basim&#x27;s journey in 9th Century Baghdad!

Alongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: 
479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad
60 million Leaps of Faith
1.2 million street cats pet
&quot;With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins and Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception,&quot; Ubisoft&#x27;s statement reads. &quot;We are proud to also share that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment.&quot; 


We had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage review. If you&#x27;re still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage tips and tricks. Read our interview with Basim voice actor Lee Majdoub after that.

Having founded it in 2006 in Osaka, Japan, later working on games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101, he left his reason for leaving up in the air. He simply said, &quot;This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs&quot; and that he feels &quot;this outcome is for the best.&quot; Now, just a few weeks later, Kamiya has started a YouTube channel – aptly called &quot;Hideki Kamiya Channel&quot; – and in his first video, he reveals he&#x27;s not retiring, as first reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 


In the video, we see Kamiya presumably leaving his office with a box of knick-knacks and more in hand before leaving in a Lamborghini. In the first video, he talks about how he&#x27;s currently unemployed, joking that peopl…</span>

Anonymous tips led to an investigation, police surveillance including wiretapping, and subsequent raids which netted 47 gold bars and sufficient evidence for two convictions. The men were also ordered to pay broadcasters over $18 million in damages.

                              <span>French audiovisual/telecoms regulator/anti-piracy agency Arcom is being credited for the decline in BitTorrent-related piracy over the past 12 years. In 2010, eight million French pirates used the protocol but in 2022 that figure was down to just two million, a government report concludes. The challenge ahead is to suppress pirate IPTV and streaming sites, the latter of which coincidentally hit the mainstream roughly 12 years ago.

                              <span>Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. 
This new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the &quot;paragon of the future.&quot; The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a &quot;deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces.&quot;


Your guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.

Dead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive&#x27;s scrapped version of Dead Island 2.</span>

                              <span>If you’re a PlayStation Plus Premium subscriber, you’re getting a new perk in the ability to stream select native PS5 games starting this month. Cloud streaming will be available for supported titles within the PS Plus Game Catalog, game trials, and personal user libraries. 
The PlayStation Blog post details the select PS5 titles that support the feature include Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Horizon: Forbidden West, Mortal Kombat 11, and Saints Row IV. Additionally, you can stream game trials for Hogwarts Legacy, The Calisto Protocol, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, to name some. DLC and add-ons will also be available to stream. 


Games streamed over the cloud will output up to 4K 60 fps (depending on your internet speed), and feature full DualSense and Tempest 3D audio support. Sony states that it plans to have &quot;hundreds&quot; of titles support this feature in the future. 
Sony is gradually rolling out cloud streaming across Japan, Europe, and North America on the following dates:
Japan – October 17
Europe – October 23
North America – October 30
As a reminder, Premium is the most expensive of the three PS Plus subscription tiers, even more so after Sony raised annual membership prices last month. While cloud streaming&#x27;s mileage varies based on internet quality, it could be a nifty perk for members. If you&#x27;re a Premium subscriber, will you be taking advantage of cloud streaming?

                              <span>In 2006, the iconic Super Mario series celebrated 10 years since its triumphant leap to 3D with Super Mario 64. That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. 
In 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim. The visual improvements from the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube were apparent, and Super Mario Sunshine once again proved to be a hit with both fans and critics.

                              <span>Nearly two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Call of Duty and Diablo maker Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. With reports indicating that the deal is set to close tomorrow, on October 13, the saga is almost over. Ahead of that deal&#x27;s finalization, we learned Activision Blizzard will not be putting the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV on Xbox Game Pass this year. Now, thanks to a new report from WindowsCentral, we&#x27;ve learned Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick held an all-hands employee meeting yesterday where former late-night show host James Corden interviewed him about future technology, the acquisition, and Guitar Hero.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 is getting new skins that clothe Moria and Pharah in the outfits of Diablo 4’s Lilith and Inarius. Those skins are part of a new wave of cosmetics incoming for the game’s Season 7: Rise of Darkness, but they’re not part of the standard premium battle pass. Instead, they’ll cost you another $40 - as much as the whole of Overwatch 1 did when it was first released. As you can imagine, people aren’t too chuffed.

If, on the other hand, you&#x27;d like to run around a rancid Victorian asylum, listening out for monster growls, dodging big glowy projectiles and firing a shotgun like The DOOM that Came To Sarnath, this could be your cup of Nyarlathotep offal.

Final Fantasy’s Distant Worlds, the NieR:Orchestra concerts, the Sonic Symphony - whatever particular series is your personal earworm, hearing music you’ve spent dozens or hours of hours listening to performed by a live orchestra can be incredibly moving and transformative. For those who feel that kind of connection with Stardew Valley, the engrossing farming-slash-romance-slash-dungeon-crawling sim is taking its OST on the road next year.

This wireless mouse is an all-time favourite for me, as it combines a simple and relatively lightweight design with bulletproof wireless and an incredible modding community that have turned this mouse into the basis for hundreds of other designs. 
As you might have guessed from the category and the title of this post, the G305 Lightspeed normally costs $50, but today it&#x27;s down to $35 at Amazon for Prime Big Deal Days.

                              <span>Keychron makes some of the very best mechanical keyboards in the world, combining premium components, mature aesthetics and extremely aggressive pricing. Amazon&#x27;s Prime Big Deal Days kicks that tendency into overdrive, with Keychron&#x27;s V3 TKL keyboard dropping from $90 to $60. 
That&#x27;s a fantastic price for a keyboard that sports features normally seen on custom keyboards: hot-swappable switches, QMK/VIA programmable firmware and gorgeous double-shot PBT keycaps.

                              <span>Once you&#x27;ve finished screaming, let me re-emphasise that this story is one of those &quot;according to report&quot; stories. It comes from unnamed sources at Activision-Blizzard, describing a recent all-hands meeting during which CEO Bobby Kotick laid out his vision for the company and gaming at large following Activison&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft, which is tipped to finally conclude this week. Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&amp;D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim. It sounds like a David Lynch fever dream.

                              <span>Whenever a friend asks for help in speccing out their upcoming PC build, I almost inevitably go to check if the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2 is in stock. Because, for lower-end and mid-range builds especially, do you truly need any other CPU cooler? The Hyper 212 Evo V2 near-perfectly  balances simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability; it’s like the PC component equivalent of Charles Eames’ museum-beloved leg splint, only less stackable. More to the point, it’s down to £33 in the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale, equalling its lowest price of 2023 thus far.

                              <span>Ara: History Untold&#x27;s headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you&#x27;ve decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the &quot;father of wargaming&quot;, in the mid-1800s. 


&quot;It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,&quot; says Menard. &quot;And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. 


&quot;They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it&#x27;d be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can&#x27;t see what the other person&#x27;s doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It&#x27;s the next turn - let&#x27;s see what people did. Was it what you expected?&quot;

                              <span>Ultrawide gaming monitors are undoubtedly a luxury, to say nothing of the powerful graphics card you’d need to power all their pixels. But cor, what a feast for the eyes these luxuries can be when they’re running a game that supports their full, wrap-around resolutions. The Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale also just happens to be on hand to take some of the monetary sting out of an ultrawide upgrade, with several well-specced displays getting chunky discounts.

                              <span>In terms of usefulness to the average PC owner, sales events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days aren’t just for knocking hundreds off big-ticket hardware. They can also make already-affordable kit even more of a bargain, as is the case with the Logitech G413 SE mechanical keyboard: a snip at £60. 


This has been on our best gaming keyboards list for a while now, specifically for delivering all the satisfying finger-feel (and durability) of a true mechanical board with a pricing that puts it closer to high-end membrane and hybrid switch models. The G413 SE employs the bumpy &#x27;tactile&#x27; style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.

Apparently, the aforesaid senior executives think Disney are losing out for merely licensing Disney properties to developers, but Iger is said to be &quot;noncommittal&quot;.

The trigger is this year&#x27;s Minecraft Mob Vote, a community ballot to decide which of three creatures will be added to the game. Many Minecrafters feel the Mob Vote (which has extended to potential new Minecraft biomes in the past) is needlessly parsimonious, and cynically divisive: given Mojang&#x27;s current headcount and Microsoft&#x27;s resources, why not add all three mobs to the game, rather than asking players to do battle over scraps? And now, those players are trying to shut the whole thing down.

                              <span>LG makes a ton of monitors, so it&#x27;s perhaps unsurprising that I wasn&#x27;t familiar with their 34WP60C-B ultrawide model. This unassuming choice normally retails for $450, but does offer a higher-than-average 160Hz refresh rate to go along with a 34-inch VA panel and 3440x1440 resolution. 
Today though, this monitor crashes into new relevance as it&#x27;s been discounted to just $200 at LG&#x27;s US store, an incredible price that makes it almost an impulse buy pickup for anyone that wants to try out the majesty of an ultrawide monitor.

                              <span>Samsung&#x27;s 990 Pro PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is the fastest gaming drive we&#x27;ve ever tested - faster even than the Crucial T700, a PCIe 5.0 SSD. And unlike that SSD, the 990 Pro works on a wide range of PCs and even the PS5, and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. 
In fact, today it&#x27;s down to $129.99 for a 2TB Heatsink model on Amazon as part of the firm&#x27;s Big Deal Days, which is a pretty sweet offer - albeit one restricted sadly to Prime customers.

                              <span>One thing that keeps luring me back to Starfield - other than the idea of building space stations out of onions - is a mysterious game within the game. Titled &quot;Symbol Game&quot;, it consists of chunky, etched, sloping pieces and a 4x6 grid mat adorned with stars, dots and lines. You may have pocketed a few sets, during your journeys across the Settled Systems. They&#x27;re not hard to find. But as far as I can tell, nobody has discovered the rules, though there are plenty of theories.

                              <span>Alienware&#x27;s AW3423DWF is a fantastic gaming monitor - and the one that I was the most sad to return after my review. This 34-inch QD-OLED ultrawide debuted at $1100 last year, but it&#x27;s now available for $300 off at Dell&#x27;s US store in a nicely-timed Anti-Amazon deal. That brings it to $800 - still a lot of money for a monitor, but absolutely worth it for a monitor that has become well-loved for users and critics alike.

Created by Latvia-based Pahris Entertainment, it launches out of Early Access today with a brace of Very Positive reviews, tantalising perma-hungover Disco Elysium players like me with flirtatious mention of &quot;an intentionally short&quot;, very non-linear campaign in which combat is totally optional and there are &quot;three to eight ways&quot; to complete any quest. &quot;It&#x27;s okay to fail,&quot; you say? Every NPC can be killed, even those apparently central to the story? Be still my beating heart.

                              <span>Are you a Mac player who&#x27;s been hungrily looking forward to the eventual Mac port of Counter-Strike 2, released last month, after sinking many hours and much pocket money into the preceding Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Fantastic news, it&#x27;s been binned off! In the course of making what they&#x27;re calling &quot;the largest technical leap in CS history&quot;, Valve have decided to discontinue support for MacOS. They&#x27;re also doing away with support for older PCs, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems - in future, the game will be exclusive to 64-bit Windows and Linux systems.

                              <span>Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  


Total War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.

                              <span>Meta may have spent the last couple of years tumbling down a metaverse rabbit hole, but the company is still responsible for creating the best VR hardware around. The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?


With the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a &quot;mixed reality&quot; device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.

You can find all of the highlights in our Prime Big Deal Days graphics card deals guide, but I wanted to draw special attention to a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti listings; the most attainable members of the infamously pricey RTX 40 series, now even lighter on the old wallet.

                              <span>We recommended a dozen Steam Next Fest demos out the gate but that barely scratched the surface of the demo-o-rama. So after diving back into the demo pile myself, I have another recommendation for you: adventuring across the galaxy in roguelikelike spaceship deck-building dungeon-crawler Cobalt Core. If you enjoy Slay The Spire and FTL, do have a look, though I might argue that FTL&#x27;s follow-up, Into The Breach seems a stronger influence. Ah, play the demo and see for yourself!

                              <span>Now that I’ve spent two breathless hours updating our main Amazon Prime Big Deal Days PC gaming deals hub, it’s time to focus in on some of the standout offers that Amazon’s latest sale is serving up. As expected, SSD prices have been widely cleaved; friend of RPS Will Judd already caught the superlative WD Black SN850X going for a bargain, and it turns out a bunch of excellent Crucial drives are on sale for even less.

The game in question is Saber Interactive&#x27;s Wild Card Football, an arcade sporting sim in the spirit of the developer&#x27;s previous NBA Playgrounds series, which is out today and attracting some buzz on Steam.

It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve done one of these (apologies for that), but off the back of our free month RPS Premium trial in September, I wanted to put out another call for reader questions from our fine crop of supporters - as an extra thank you and benefit for your continued support of the site. This is your opportunity to ask us, the RPS editorial team, questions about games, the site, the way we do things, and other things we like. These questions will then be answered in our semi-regular (ish, sort of, as best we can) Ask RPS column, which is a public post available to everyone. So come and tell us what&#x27;s been on your mind in the comments below.

                              <span>Much like a Call of Duty player inching up the stairs behind a wily sniper, Microsoft are closing in on final, final approval of their multi-billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, having more-or-less won over the UK&#x27;s competition and markets authority. The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.
Aside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft&#x27;s Game Pass subscription service. But not for a while, it seems.

Since player progress gained unofficially upsets Cognosphere&#x27;s business model, a crackdown isn&#x27;t unexpected. The fact that the developer could be identified over five allegedly infringing screenshots comes as much more of a surprise.

                              <span>Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren&#x27;t as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.
&quot;The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,&quot; the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn&#x27;t immediately clear from the pictures. &quot;There are four separate cover panels,&quot; it says, &quot;with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.&quot; This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.
The slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. 
If you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:

                              <span>Ubisoft revealed its &quot;fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits&quot; first-person shooter, Tom Clancy&#x27;s XDefiant, in 2021. It&#x27;s a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. 
The team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. 
Here&#x27;s Ubisoft&#x27;s full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay:

As you can see, Ubisoft doesn&#x27;t indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. 
In the meantime, watch Game Informer&#x27;s XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year.

                              <span>Nintendo revealed last week that it was teaming up with Lego to create Animal Crossing sets, in line with its previous Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong sets. Now, the company has released a new trailer for the Animal Crossing x Lego collaboration, alongside the official reveal of five Lego sets, their prices, and the release date. 
The five sets releasing March 1, 2024, are Isabelle&#x27;s House Visit, Julian&#x27;s Birthday Party, Bunnie&#x27;s Outdoor Activities, Kapp&#x27;n&#x27;s Island Boat Tour, and Nook&#x27;s Cranny &amp; Rosie&#x27;s House.

                              <span>Almost two years ago, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Reports say the acquisition deal is expected to close this week and Xbox players are anticipating the addition of Activision Blizzard games to the Game Pass lineup. However, a new tweet by Activision Blizzard makes it sound like the company&#x27;s games won&#x27;t hit the subscription service until next year. Plus, Activision Blizzard says it won&#x27;t be adding the upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III or the recently released Diablo IV to Game Pass this year.
Here&#x27;s what Activision Blizzard said in a tweet posted yesterday: 
It’s awesome to see anticipation building for Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. As we continue to work toward regulatory approval of the Microsoft deal, we’ve been getting some questions whether our upcoming and recently launched games will be available via Game Pass.
October 9, 2023
Diablo IV launched back in June and we had a great time with it. You can read about why in Game Informer&#x27;s Diablo IV review. For more about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, check out Game Informer&#x27;s preview here and then read up on the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from last week&#x27;s Call of Duty Next livestream.

And Fortnite players know that this month is when developer Epic Games celebrates the season with Fortnitemares, a spooky-themed event that typically includes new weapons, quests, skins, and more. This year is no different as Fortnitemares 2023 runs from now until November 3 and brings with it Alan Wake, Michael Myers, Jack Skellington, a new shotgun, a new blade, a pumpkin launcher, a witch broom, and more. 
Everything In The Fortnitemares 2023 Event: 
New Fortnite Skins And Outfits
One of the most exciting aspects of a new Fortnitemares Halloween event is the addition of new skins and outfits into the battle royale. And for our money, this year&#x27;s lineup is one of the best so far.

The news comes almost a month after the company announced plans to introduce a controversial install fee for developers, which resulted in an industry-wide backlash.
Riccitiello is stepping down as CEO, president, and a member of the board of directors. In a press release, Unity states that James M. Whitehurst will take over as interim CEO while the board seeks a permanent replacement. Whitehurst is a tech veteran who served as president at IBM from 2008 to 2020 and as a senior advisor from 2021 to 2022. 
“It’s been a privilege to lead Unity for nearly a decade and serve our employees, customers, developers and partners, all of whom have been instrumental to the Company’s growth,” Riccitiell…</span>

                              <span>DDR5 prices continue their continued downward spiral, today reaching a new low-water mark: $90 for a 32GB dual-channel kit of DDR5-6000 from G.Skill. That&#x27;s an awesome price for a spec that has emerged as the current sweet spot for DDR5-compatible AMD and Intel systems.

After spending two and a bit years flexing his typing arms as our senior staff writer, Ed will now be stepping up to wrangle our reviews section into bigger and better shape than ever before - or rather, he already has, as he officially took over the role at the start of October. He will henceforth be known not simply as Edders, but as the new and improved Reviews Edders, so please come and congratulate him on his ascension in the comments below.

While Todd Howard said we’d be able to visit over 1,000 planets, the Bethesda dev actually undersold the sheer scale of Starfield’s galaxy - there are actually close to 1,700 planets, and now someone’s seen them all just weeks after launch.

                              <span>In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy&#x27;s comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that&#x27;s my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game &quot;built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.&quot;
Puha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2&#x27;s visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2&#x27;s performance, but we&#x27;ll get to that further down the page.)

                              <span>The latest Steam Next Fest is upon us, bringing with it a freshly packed week of new, free demos to try until Monday October 16th. There are literally hundreds you could try installing if you were that way inclined - you can view the full list right here if you&#x27;d rather browse through it at your own leisure - but we&#x27;ve been playing some of these demos in advance to help make wading through its torrent of shiny new games a little bit easier. Below, you&#x27;ll find 12 of our favourites so far, ranging from snazzy-looking shooters and big RTS games to neat little autobattlers, indie immersive sims and retro puzzle platformers. If you&#x27;re in need of some guidance this Steam Next Fest, read on.

                              <span>Razer make some of the best gaming peripherals in the business across a wide range of categories, and now you can take home a whole set of them for 90 bucks over at Woot. 
The &quot;Heroic Bundle V2&quot; includes a mechanical keyboard, mouse, grip tape for the mouse and mousepad, offering a 40% reduction on buying these items separately. That&#x27;s an awesome deal and well worth considering - the only peripheral you&#x27;d really need to add is a headset!

                              <span>I do love a game that tells you upfront what it&#x27;s about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren&#x27;t dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can&#x27;t fault the logic.
Click the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you&#x27;ll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there&#x27;s a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain&#x27;t so bad. As she points out, &quot;underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it&#x27;s nice and cool&quot;. Again, I can&#x27;t fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a &quot;rat god&quot;.

                              <span>“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it&#x27;s been a constant fight.”


Ohlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons &amp; Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&amp;D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons &amp; Dragons,” he says.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a side mission in Cyberpunk 2077 that involves abducting a notorious union-breaker. One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker&#x27;s organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt&#x27;s firing around 100 employees in July due to &quot;overstaffing&quot;. Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren&#x27;t employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.


&quot;We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,&quot; reads an official FAQ from the group. &quot;This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.&quot;

                              <span>New research from piracy tracking firm MUSO shows that movie piracy is strongly linked to box office revenues. When pirated downloads peak or slow down, movie theater visits show a similar trend. While this may sound counterintuitive, the finding is actually quite obvious. Correlation is not causation and pirates are people too.

                              <span>The June 2023 reveal of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself. Elephant Mario, who appears larger than life on our current cover art, quickly became one of the most recognizable elements of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.
Players won&#x27;t need to wait long to play as Elephant Mario, as it appears in the very first stage, Welcome to the Flower Kingdom. The Elephant Fruit emerges out of a block, and true to the trailer, Mario transforms into this new for…</span>

The headsets have not been without their growing pains, but the path from Rift to Quest has been generally smooth, and the iterations have always added worthy improvements. Meta Quest 3 continues along that path to deliver what is, by a large margin, my favorite VR headset, but it doesn’t fix all the problems the medium continues to face.
Comfortability And Visuals
Wearing Meta Quest 3 is reasonably comfortable. The straps are easy to adjust and allow you to make the headset surprisingly tight against your face. This is good for blocking out light and mov…</span>

Yesterday, following news that developers at Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 studio CD Projekt Red have formed a union, Game Informer reached out to the company to ask if it had a comment or statement on it. Game Informer also asked if CDPR plans to voluntarily recognize the union. 
Here is the statement Game Informer received from a CDPR spokesperson:
The original story continues below...
Original story, 10/9/23:
Developers at Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt Red have formed a union. The union was formed in response to the company&#x27;s three rounds of layoffs this year, as reported by Eurogamer. Polish Gamedev Workers Union founders Lev Ki and Paweł Myszka say that all necessary documentation has been submitted but that the union hasn&#x27;t heard any response from…</span>

Along with some additional details on the case, today we take a closer look at how the Premier League used the news to send specific messaging in support of its overall anti-piracy drive.

                              <span>This week on Replay Charles Harte (who recently played nearly every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game) and I are going back to 2007 for a look at the original Assassin&#x27;s Creed. With Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage on our minds, which is an overt throwback to the classic Assassin&#x27;s Creed formula, we decided to take a look back at the first game in the blockbuster series. Some elements of the game hold up and others don&#x27;t, but in any case, it&#x27;s a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.
You can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin&#x27;s Creed right here.

                              <span>Following the last entry in the New Super Mario Bros. series, which was based on the idea of recreating the experience of the original Super Mario Bros. game from 1985 in a modern way, Nintendo went back to the drawing board. Though the four distinct New Super Mario Bros. games were well-received and extremely successful, the developers wanted to deliver something fresh to fans of the 2D series.
&quot;The New Super Mario Bros. series has been going on for a while since the release of New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, so we wanted to create an all-new 2D Mario experience,&quot; Super Mario Bros. Wonder director Shiro Mouri says. &quot;That&#x27;s how this project started.&quot;
Despite the initial desire to create something new, Mouri and his development team started thinking about what made the series so disti…</span>

                              <span>Developer Arkane Studios&#x27; multiplayer vampire shooter Redfall launched earlier this year to middling reviews from critics and players alike – Game Informer gave the game a 5 out of 10. Ahead of its launch in May, Xbox revealed that Redfall would only launch with a 30 FPS Quality Mode on Xbox Series X/S, noting that a Performance Mode would arrive at a later unspecified date. Nearly six months later, that date has arrived: Performance Mode is now live in Redfall. 
Publisher Bethesda&#x27;s patch notes about today&#x27;s Redfall update don&#x27;t specify how exactly this Performance Mode works, but presumably, it runs the game at 60 FPS. This update also brings some heavily requested features to Arkane as well, including stealth takedowns, more accessibility options, multiplayer communication improvements,…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft&#x27;s plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren&#x27;t very superstitious), it&#x27;s not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.
Still, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they&#x27;re completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.
We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…
September 22, 2023
This news followed the companies&#x27; victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft&#x27;s hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.

                              <span>Earlier today, former Telltale Games cinematic artist Jonah Huang revealed on Twitter that he had been laid off from the studio in early September. In his tweet, he writes that &quot;Telltale laid most of us off in early September,&quot; and that the layoffs occurred weeks after the company acquired U.K.-based studio, Flavourworks, which developed Erica. 
This is a sore subject, but I feel it necessary to add to the gaming layoff news: Telltale laid most of us off early September. Status of TWAU2, I can&#x27;t say (NDA).
October 5, 2023
Telltale has now confirmed to Game Informer that layoffs at the studio did occur, although its official statement features no mention of just how many employees were let go. The statement doesn&#x27;t mention severance for laid-off employees, but Huang notes on Twitter that he…</span>

The feature that put Call of Duty on the map is back and bigger than ever.

Brian Shea has spent more time with the game than anyone outside of Nintendo and spoke with members of Nintendo about creating the big step for 2D Mario. Then we kick Brian out of the show to welcome Wesley LeBlanc to tell us about his experience with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage. Wesley has finished the game (and it took him less than 20 hours) and has thoughts on the game&#x27;s strange place in the pantheon of Assassin&#x27;s Creed games. Lastly, Alex shares his latest Pokémon card escapades and decides who in history he can successfully fight.

                              <span>Dredge was a delightful indie surprise when it launched earlier this year, but if it left you wanting more spooky ship survival, you&#x27;re in luck. The Pale Reach is Dredge&#x27;s first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.


Set in icy waters, the DLC will include &quot;1-3 hours of content&quot; and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. 
For more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game&#x27;s publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.

                              <span>The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they&#x27;re taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.
The game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project &quot;in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.&quot; That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there&#x27;s still no screenwriter attached to the project.
There are still many questions in the air about the project. They&#x27;ve yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is &quot;set in the world&quot; of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Atari announced that it acquired Berzerk, its sequel Frenzy, and 10 more classic arcade properties. Now, as part of Atari&#x27;s Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. 
The original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, &quot;bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.&quot;

                              <span>Nintendo has teased a collaboration between its Animal Crossing series and Lego. It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn&#x27;t reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.
The tweet accompanying the teaser says, &quot;Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!&quot; The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two.

This Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn&#x27;t the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets. The two have been steadily releasing different Super Mario sets for a few years now, with four Donkey Kong Lego sets releasing back in August. Even outside of Nintendo, Lego is no stranger to taking video game characters and turning them into Legos. It&#x27;s been doing that with Sonic the Hedgehog Lego sets for a while now.

                              <span>Rockstar Games revealed that it was bringing Red Dead Redemption and its Undead Nightmare DLC to PlayStation 4 and Switch back in August. It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn&#x27;t tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. 
Now, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news.

Elsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn&#x27;t list which. 
If you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s ranking of every single Rockstar game.

                              <span>Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!
Dark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.
This time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. 
Our reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.
