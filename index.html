                              <span>Originally released in 2010, Desktop Dungeons is a top-down puzzler about whacking beasties in the correct order, exploring the map to heal, and retreating to enjoy your hard-earned taxidermy skills. Desktop Dungeons: Rewind is a recently announced remaster of the tile-based roguelike - freshly coated with 3D graphics and a rewind feature - and it’s now fully launching on April 18th.

                              <span>When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3&#x27;s Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries&#x27; chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who&#x27;d just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem&#x27;s The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem&#x27;s son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  
&quot;People tell us, &#x27;Don&#x27;t fuck it up, this guy&#x27;s important,&#x27;&quot; Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a &quot;national treasure&quot; and &quot;mandatory reading in high school&quot; for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team&#x27;s &quot;had to deal with&quot; in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this &quot;isn&#x27;t a one-to-one adaptation&quot; of Lem&#x27;s interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.

                              <span>Normally, when a big game releases, I’ll test how it runs on PC, knock together a best settings guide, respond in the negative to an email that asks if it will run on a GTX 680, and we all move on with our lives. Not so with The Last of Us Part 1, which as you’ve probably seen, has launched in a technical state that’s bleaker than Joel’s face. The first few patches and hotfixes (more are planned) have made it somewhat less terrible on powerful desktops, but I’m sad to report that playing The Last of Us Part 1 on the Steam Deck is not currently worth your time.

                              <span>At last year&#x27;s PAX East, we spent a lot of our time poking around the PAX Rising Showcase booth, which is a collection of indie games curated by PAX itself. Not only did we find a bunch of cool games to play, but we were also able to chat to the games&#x27; creators, as all Rising finalists are invited to attend in person to show their work to the public. 
This year, though, Rachel and I decided to go one step further. We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).

I don’t claim to understand whether this has something to do with “ray-tracing” or some manner of “screen space occlusion” or what have you – Digital Foundry, I am available for work – all I know is that there’s an option to crank up the gloss until you’re pretty much zooming around the galaxy in a big angry disco ball.

                              <span>2018 April 1st, the music producer Nosiestorm dropped the single Crab Rave, which became a meme sensation. Since the music video was made with the Unreal Engine 4, it&#x27;s no surprise that the Nosiestorm ventured into game development, and threw the rave cabe into a shooting game. After three long years of development, Crab Champions was finally launched - on April 1st this year.

Overwatch 2&#x27;s next playable character is a support hero called Lifeweaver and he’ll be joining the roster alongside Season 4, expected to begin on April 11th. Blizzard had previously said they were committed to bolstering Overwatch 2&#x27;s support lineup since it’s currently the game’s most taxing and least rewarding role to play. It seems they’re making good on that promise, though, as Lifeweaver’s reported abilities have the potential to sway matches.

                              <span>Oregon indie outfit has a suitable home
Publisher Devolver Digital has announced that it has acquired indie developer Doinksoft, the Orgeon-based studio behind fun, silly, and popular releases such as Gato Roboto, Demon Throttle, and the studio&#x27;s current project, Gunbrella.
First announced in the summer of last year, Gunbrella is an apocalyptic noir adventure that sees a dangerous drifter crossing the badlands on a do-or-die odyssey of mystery and vengeance. Our anti-hero will seek such justice armed with little more than a mean attitude and an incredibly versatile rifle, which also doubles as a shield, a zipline, a floatation device and, of course, an umbrella.
Gunbrella is currently in development for PC and Nintendo Switch, and is tentatively scheduled to launch later in 2023.

Hitcents has announced that HardBoiled Studios&#x27; egg-centric climb-’em-up, Yolked - The Egg Game is leaving Early Access behind on April 6, 2023. If you’re eggs-pecting me to make egg puns throughout this article, I’m going to have to disappoint you. The egg is the cradle of life, and I cannot eggs-press the level of respect that demands.
Now, if I can have your attention, I would like you to eggs-amine this game.
https://youtu.be/Be0P8Ct6-28
Nope. I can’t go on like that. It’s horrible, and I can feel the shame starting to knot up in my chest. So let’s forget this ever happened. It&#x27;s eggs-cruciating.
Yolked reminds me of Heave Ho or Endoparasitic. You play as an arm-having egg, and guide them across various environments and obstacles using the kind of grip that makes bass musicians jealous. You can also collect costumes for your eggs. That mostly sums it up, but the trailer demonstrates a lot of interesting situations, including some so bizarre that I want to see how they fit into the game.
As a writer in video game media, I sometimes get to abuse my platform. This is one such time. I don’t really have any time to play Yolked for review, so instead, I’m highlighting its impending launch as a way to try and get more people to play it, so I can live vicariously through them.
Yolked - The Egg Game is available on Steam Early Access right now, but you can eggs-pect the full version to drop April 6, 2023.

Everything on the earth is a wasteland. All is left to dust and ash, and by the time the player enters the frame in Terra Nil, all that&#x27;s green is gone. There is nothing left to do but rebuild. And it&#x27;s in restoring nature, in unpacking the very idea of a city-builder, that Terra Nil finds a smart twist on a traditional foundation.
It&#x27;s fun to think that the same team behind Broforce and Genital Jousting made Terra Nil. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think a studio that&#x27;s made games about bros and dicks can&#x27;t also make a game about ecological restoration. But Terra Nil sees Free Live exploring an incredibly serene approach to puzzles and city-building. Free Lives has range, is what I&#x27;m saying.

Merch-maker Numskull has announced the next statue in the company&#x27;s Silent Hill range — And second in the lineup of nightmarish creatures and dream warriors comes a particular fan favorite, in the form of Silent Hill 3 protagonist Heather Mason.
The tortured and traumatized young hero — forced to step up and face her fears and her own destiny when trouble comes a&#x27;callin — is the latest release in Numskull&#x27;s burgeoning range based on the skin-crawling Konami franchise. The PVC statue, which stands around 10 inches tall, depicts Ms. Mason in her classic casual clothing, packing heat and dramatically wiping a cut on her delicate face. Heather&#x27;s base features a visual motif stylized after the Happy-go-Doomy locale of Lakeside Amusement Park, and is complete with an appearance by its creepy mascot, Robbie the Rabbit.

Heather will make for a wonderful companion to Numskull&#x27;s previously released Bubble Head Nurse statue, as dedicated Silent Hill fans slowly turn their lounge mantle into a menagerie of nightmares. What&#x27;s next in the range? Who knows? But I&#x27;m sure hoping for a life-size, crazy-eyed Eileen head to block up my kitchen doorway. Wouldn&#x27;t that be a fun conversation piece?
Whatever we get, Numskull&#x27;s Silent Hill range is an attractive and (relatively) affordable way to pay tribute to one of horror gaming&#x27;s most iconic franchises. For interested parties, the Silent Hill 3 Heather Mason statue is available to pre-order now over on the Numskull website, retailing for around £100 (or roughly $130 USD). The statue is expected to ship in September 2023.

Legendary Entertainment, the production company behind recent adaptations such as Dune, Jurassic World, Godzilla vs Kong, and Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, has purchased the film and TV rights to Capcom&#x27;s iconic franchise Street Fighter. News of the sale was revealed in The Hollywood Reporter
The deal is expected to see the production company work in alignment with Capcom on any and all future projects, be they streaming series, anime, or live-action movies. The sale comes at a time when the bar for gaming adaptations has been raised, ever-so-slightly, from a critical standpoint, while the potential for financial success has basically never been higher. Paramount Pictures&#x27; Sonic the Hedgehog movies have been an incredible success, while the forthcoming Super Mario Bros…</span>

Nintendo has announced that the legendary N64 release Pokemon Stadium will be the next classic title joining the Nintendo Switch Online library — Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service will be available to download the 2000-released adventure from Wednesday, April 12.
Released for the N64 at the height of the original Pokemon mania, Pokemon Stadium saw the cutesy critters from Game Boy releases Pokemon Red, Pokemon Blue, and Pokemon Yellow come together to battle it out in trainer-on-trainer action. A single-player campaign saw players battle throughout a range of stadiums set within the Pokeverse, while multiplayer action allowed up to four trainers to compete in head-to-head throwdown — all clamoring to be the very best, like no one ever was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Vd8P2QJwbrM&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;NintendoUK
And, when the dust has settled, then players can chill out with a series of fun and silly mini-games — such as Sushi-Go-Round and Magikarp&#x27;s Splash — located in the oddly titled &quot;Kid&#x27;s Club&quot;. The Nintendo Switch Online version will feature all of the modes from the original release. Unfortunately, the implementation of the Game Boy releases is not a part of this version, though hopefully this can be rectified down the line.
I&#x27;ve bored y&#x27;all with this story before, but I was working in games retail when Pokemon Stadium dropped, and there is no other title that I remember being so fervently sought after more. We had people offering to pay double if we could promise a copy, pre-orders that weren&#x27;t being fulfilled for weeks, and a situation where we had to keep all stock off the showfloor as people would rabidly attempt to bargain us to sell people&#x27;s reserves to them.
&quot;Can you call me when it comes back in?&quot;
&quot;No, we cannot.&quot;
Pokemon Stadium joins Nintendo Switch Online on April 12.

The console wars were still raging when I was in high school, and while I was on team GameCube, a good friend of mine was on team Xbox. Maybe not firmly team Xbox, as he wasn’t as close-minded as I was. He loved the short-lived Dreamcast and even managed to introduce me to some PS2 titles that stuck with me. However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.
With just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2. It sold an estimated 24 million, which gave it a small lead over the Gamecube’s estimated 22 million. Most importantly, it solidified Microsoft as a big player in the console market that endures to this day.

Asus has announced the ROG Ally, ROG&#x27;s first handheld gaming console meant for taking PC games on the go, much like a Steam Deck. But thanks to the day the company made the announcement, Asus has had to reaffirm that yes, it&#x27;s for real.
Originally revealed around April 1, the Asus ROG Ally is a handheld console. Its initial pitch video shows the handheld bouncing between different popular PC games, played in a variety of locations. It&#x27;s essentially similar to the Steam Deck and various other competitors that have emerged.

                              <span>Heroic kusoge turns heads
Classifying a game as kusoge doesn’t immediately mean I hate it. I’ve covered many games that I enjoy or even love. Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken is sometimes referred to as one of the worst games of all time, and it definitely isn’t fun, but I kind of enjoyed my time with it. Paperboy on N64 is different, though. I just like Paperboy.
I recognize that Paperboy is a game with a mountain of issues that resulted in critics at the time giving it a great big shrug. However, there’s not much like it. Even while it’s technically the third game in the Paperboy series, High Voltage Software’s take on the formula is wholly unique and somewhat bizarre. A strange take on an already weird license. Problems be damned; it’s one I’ve gone back to quite a few times.

                              <span>Hey, watch!
We&#x27;ve got a couple of new things going on over on our lovely YouTube channel at the moment. And in one of our new series, Felix is tackling older games that he&#x27;s never played before, yet among our community, are highly beloved.
First Bytes has been kicking around as an idea for a while here at Nintendo Life because not everyone in the world has played every single classic video game. So Felix has decided to tackle his backlog head-on and play through some of the greatest Nintendo games ever. And he&#x27;s started with a corker of a game — The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

If you&#x27;ve had your eye on Tin Hearts, a Lemmings-inspired puzzle game from publisher Wired Productions and developer Rogue Sun, then the good news is that it&#x27;s heading to the Switch later this month on April 20th, 2023.
Tin Hearts has been cooking for a little while now, but with the game boasting over 40 levels of &quot;time-bending, soldier-routing riddles&quot; and the ex-Lionhead pedigree on the dev team, we&#x27;re hopeful this one is going to be worth the wait. We&#x27;ve in for a treat in the audio department, too, with the game&#x27;s soundtrack being handled by award-winning composer Matthew Chastney, who has previously produced music for movie trailers including Joker and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.

We originally published this article back in 2020 as part of Super Mario Bros.&#x27; 35th anniversary year. With the release of The Super Mario Bros.

After months of trailers, posters and merchandise reveals, we are finally into the opening week of The Super Mario Bros. Movie (opening week for most, that is). While we get ourselves ready to slip on a pair of dungarees and &#x27;iconic&#x27; boots (apparently), the predictions for the film&#x27;s opening weekend box office are already starting to roll in, with Deadline&#x27;s latest preview positioning the movie&#x27;s initial takings as the best of 2023 so far — let&#x27;s-a go indeed.
According to the outlet&#x27;s estimates (which are based on ticket sales, past performances and release timing amongst other factors), the Mario movie is set to make in excess of $225 million over its opening weekend, broken down into $125M+ in the US and Canada, and $100M+ abroad.

A week ago at the time of writing, Nintendo finally lifted the curtain on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - properly, this time. We were treated to a whole ten minutes&#x27; worth of gameplay footage from the upcoming game, giving us a glimpse at Link&#x27;s four new abilities: Recall, Fuse, Ultrahand, and Ascend.
But what did we think of it? Well, our pals Felix and Alex have sat down to discuss their thoughts on what we&#x27;ve seen so far, and there&#x27;s a heck of a lot to get through. Could we hypothetically use Ultrahand to create a giant ramp to reach the Sky Islands? Well, let&#x27;s talk about that! And if you&#x27;d like to share your own thoughts on the recent gameplay, then be sure to check out our recent poll.

                              <span>Po dlouhé době byli strahovští Bastlíři na výjezdu - tentokrát na konferenci Hackaday v Berlíně. Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také &quot;Badge&quot; - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.

Ale nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.

Samozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.

Ať už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.</span>

2023 has no shortage of big, blockbuster games on the horizon. It&#x27;s a year where Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Diablo are all getting new entries. Yet coming back from PAX East 2023, I kept thinking about the smaller games now littering my release radar.
Honestly, this is a major appeal of PAX, at least to media and the games vying for their attention. It&#x27;s a time where we&#x27;re in town for a few larger projects, like a panel or a big hands-on, but we then have a lot of time to fill with various booths and games we might not have known much about going in.
So, my list of favorite games I saw at PAX East 2023 reflects that. Some of these entries feel entirely expected, as they&#x27;re the most obvious candidates. However, others are surprise hits I barely knew abo…</span>

Back in 2016 Remedy and Microsoft teamed up for a live action TV show/game hybrid starring Shawn Ashmore called Quantum Break. It was a wild endeavor; and while it had plenty of flaws, even the most ardent detractors had to admit that it was unique. It&#x27;s also uniquely leaving the Xbox Game Pass service soon, despite being published by Microsoft.
As a reminder, Quantum Break was indeed developed by Remedy Entertainment (the purveyors of Alan Wake, Control, and mo…</span>

While SimCity happened way back in 1989, the city builder genre is in a sort of renaissance. Sure, Cities: Skylines continues its stranglehold on municipal simulation, but a sub-genre has sprung up in its shadow; the survival city builder (sometimes just known as settlement-builders). While this genre has technically been around for decades, it only started finding its identity in the wake of 2014’s Banished. Since then, a number of games like Settlement Survival have picked up the ball where it was left, and other games like Frostpunk have taken the concept in different directions.
Management games, in general, and city builders as a whole are big relaxation games for me. While games that require a hyper-focused state, such as Doom Eternal, help me manage my anxiety, it…</span>

SNK has announced that it is set to re-release one of the very finest, (and for some fans, the last finest), entries in the legendary KoF franchise — The King of Fighters XIII: Global Match, which will see the 2010 gem rereleased on PlayStation and Switch, bolstered with all-new rollback netcode.
Originally released in 2010, KoF XIII was, essentially, the rejuvenation that the long-running franchise had been crying out for some years. Featuring gorgeous rendered/rotoscoped pixel art, a roster of fantastic, beautifully animated characters, cool new stages, and a great soundtrack, the launch of KoF XIII felt incredibly special, especially given the chaotic, half-baked disappointment of its predecessor, KoF XII. Unfortunately, despite being held in high regard, lackluster online capabilities did little to help the already niche fighter hold its ground on the competitive scene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;mCJjObBRrk4&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SNKOFFICIAL
But SNK hopes that Global Match, complete with its revamped, modern-day netcode, will allow those fans pining for the latter days of the franchise&#x27;s 2D venture to get back in the ring, taking on KoF (and other fighting game) fans worldwide. Perhaps we&#x27;ll even see the great title make a quiet return on the professional circuit — though SNK will understandably be putting most of its chips in the KoF XV bucket. Regardless, this is fantastic news for long-term KoF fans, and I get my gal Leona and my boy Ash back in all their super-smooth, pixel-powered glory.
The King of Fighters XIII: Global Match is in development for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. A beta test for PS4 is scheduled for the summer, when more details will also be revealed regarding release.

Born of Bread starts off simple enough. Papa Baker, a chef for the city&#x27;s royalty, is asked to make some special bread for the evening&#x27;s dinner. After using a book with a cursed air about it, he accidentally creates a sentient dough boy. He dubs the living loaf as Loaf, and so Born of Bread begins: an adventure following a magical bread boy brought to life.
It is charming, for sure. Role-playing games don&#x27;t always demo well in loud, busy show-floor settings like PAX East 2023, but Born of Bread immediately clicked. It&#x27;s got a gorgeous look, evocative of its inspirations in Paper Mario; the writing is fun, and the music hits. It&#x27;s not all presentation though, as WildArts Studio&#x27;s Born of Bread is a solid RPG that&#x27;s worth keeping an eye on.

                              <span>&#x27;Creators First&#x27;
Veteran video game developer Konami has announced that it has opened a new studio in Osaka, Japan. The new offices, located in the Osaka Umeda Twin Towers south building, will support the developer in its efforts both grow and endure over the coming decades.
&quot;Konami Osaka Studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and comes with the concept of &#x27;Creators First&#x27;&quot;, said the developer in a press release. &quot;It is characterized by a well-developed environment where creators can demonstrate their full potential, and is set up in a location with convenient transportation access. As the major production center in Western Japan, the facility is fully equipped with motion capture equipments and sound studios necessary for product development.&quot;
Konami, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this week, goes on to suggest that the new building will be a core entity in the studio&#x27;s current and future projects, noting that it hopes Konami Osaka will encourage &quot;sustainable growth&quot; over the next 50 years. So I guess Konami is not looking to get out of the gaming biz anytime soon — despite the past decade&#x27;s penchant for gyms and pachinko halls.
In addition to the new offices, Konami continues its work on the establishment of a new, next-gen R&amp;D center. Konami Creative Front Tokyo Bay is expected to open in 2025, and provide the central locale for the company&#x27;s experiments into new engines and technology. Having already teased several unannounced game reveals for 2023, Konami&#x27;s next major release is expected to be a remake of the legendary survival horror title Silent Hill 2, which is in development for PS5 and PC.

                              <span>Hey you can actually use all the content now
Marvel&#x27;s Avengers came, went; and then somehow went again shortly after every &quot;major&quot; periodic content patch. No matter how much content the team added it just was never enough: namely because there was no real connection to the story, many of those content additions were reskins, and the game never truly shed its live service component. Also, dangling Spider-Man over people&#x27;s heads (as an exclusive no less!) probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea from whoever was responsible (from the top to the bottom).
The newest (and final) game-is-dead patch changes all that. And of course, while it&#x27;s too late for Avengers, we can still check out its current state for fun and use it as a case study of what not to do.

                              <span>Backstreet Boss
SNK has announced that another legendarily irritating boss character is headed to the roster of its neat scrapper The King of Fighters XV — Goenitz, he of mythic wind abilities and boyband haircut, will be joining the roster as part of a free DLC update launching this summer.
Goenitz made his debut in the popular sequel The King of Fighters &#x27;96, where he was presented as one of the antagonistic Four Kings of Orochi.  Goenitz — or &quot;Goenitz of the Wildly-Blowing Wind&quot; — is typified by his graceful, carefree, and aloof movements, his ability to conjure powerful blasts of air on the fly, and his horrific chinstrap beard and undercut highlights combo. He is, in essence, the &quot;father&quot; of the Orochi-powered team of Chris, Shermie, and Yashiro, all of whom are already present in KoF XV.
You can check out a sneak peek at Goenitz in the video below, timed to 2:45.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ed65K9MnidQ&amp;t&#x3D;153s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;SNKOFFICIAL
The coming of Goenitz is one of a number of updates planned for the title&#x27;s new season. This week has already seen the return of veteran character Kim Kaphwan, who is now available to purchase as part of KoF XV&#x27;s expansive roster. In addition, we can expect to see the ABSOLUTE MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula make her return in just a few months&#x27; time, as well as the initial tests for cross-platform capabilities. We can expect three further characters to arrive in 2023, alongside new balance adjustments. All in, KoF XV is getting the best post-release support offered to an SNK release in many moons.
The King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Survivalist sequel pushed back a full year
Studio Wildcard has announced that its long-in-development sequel ARK II will no longer meet its tentative 2023 release date — the survival sandbox sequel is now expected to launch on Xbox and PC platforms in late-2024.
&quot;We’ve put much thought into delaying ARK II for the betterment of the final product and the team’s well-being,&quot; reads a statement from the developer. &quot;This news will be disappointing to many—we feel it too — but we’re confident this heavy decision is the right one. Our goal is to make ARK II the best game it can be and provide a truly exceptional and rewarding experience for players.&quot;
&quot;We sincerely apologize for this delay and genuinely appreciate your understanding. Your support and passion are vital to us, and we will continue to work intensively to deliver the ultimate next-gen dinosaur survival experience. With that in mind, we do not plan to showcase any gameplay/screenshots/videos of ARK II this year; however, we intend to keep you informed and engaged in the development process by regularly showcasing more ARK II assets in the months ahead.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;D8KbXpk2J9Y&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;ARK%3ASurvivalEvolved
ARK II, the sequel to 2017 release Ark: Survival Evolved, was first announced back in 2020, and has been in deep development since. A trailer was released during the June 2022 Xbox Showcase, but the title has remained relatively quiet since then. It is quite believable that, given the incredible scope of Studio Wildcard&#x27;s project, the building of the sequel is a grueling and complex venture — especially given the young nature of its powerful Unreal 5 technology. For now, budding dino riders will simply have to continue to play the waiting game, for another 16 months at the very least.
You can check out the full version of the studio&#x27;s lenthy statement on the official website.
ARK II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.

                              <span>Monarch of the Quarter-hole
Super Villain Games has dropped a trailer outlining their upcoming game, King of the Arcade, which is set to drop on April 12, 2023. Right now, the game is set to release exclusively on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, which is something I didn’t even know happens.
King of the Arcade seems to be about saving a local arcade with prime joystick handling. You play as Mac McCormick, a former arcade champion. Although he’s no longer in his prime, he jumps to action to save an arcade from an evil landlord — by playing video games, I guess! I thought this might be, like, win the prize purse and use the money to pay the rent, but apparently, the landlord has “seven members of his arcade gang,” which makes less sense while also being a lot cooler.
https://youtu.be/oI0Wimz5sCU
There are 40 games within various genres throughout King of the Arcade, which makes it a sort of compilation of fictional titles not unlike Arcade Paradise. What is less clear is how these are all tied together. It obviously has some narrative focus, but is it a linear progression of games? Do you play them between visual novel dialogue portions? The press release says the arcade is “open-world” but not much else.
King of the Arcade is the second game from Super Villain Games after Doug Hates His Job. Reaction to Doug Hates His Job doesn’t seem to be the most positive, but I like what I see with King of the Arcade. Most of the feedback toward the previous game seemed to focus on a lack of polish, so hopefully that won’t be the case here.
Unfortunately, it may be a while before I, personally, find out, since I don’t own an Xbox One or Xbox series X|S, but if you do, then you’ll be able to grab King of the Arcade on April 12.

                              <span>Drifting over to Europe
For a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the &quot;Joy-Con drift&quot; Switch hardware issues. Eventually, the number of impacted consumers hit critical mass and they had to respond: by offering free repairs. Although Europe and the UK have done this on a case-by-case basis (and not necessarily out of warranty): that&#x27;s changing now with a grander, more sweeping statement on the Nintendo EU support pages. In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.
Here&#x27;s the full statement from Nintendo of Europe about the situation:
&quot;Nintendo takes great pride in creating high-quality and durable products and is continuously making improvements to them. Therefore and until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers who purchased the respective product in the EEA, UK and Switzerland that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control sticks will be conducted at no charge by official Nintendo repair centres.&quot;

Nintendo even calls this &quot;responsiveness syndrome&quot; or &quot;so-called drifting&quot; (ha!) on their official site. Here&#x27;s how you can actually get it fixed if you live in the aforementioned areas.
A link to book a repair for Joy-Con in Europe or the UK
You can find the full breakdown on this page here. Nintendo also has a full customer support page to book a Joy-Con repair here. I&#x27;ve actually had two pairs of Joy-Con repaired in the US, and it was a painless process. Hopefully this policy is here to stay and everyone can get their controllers fixed going forward.
[Thanks John!]

Did you play through Kirby and the Forgotten Land yet? What did you think of the final boss? Well, director Shinya Kumazaki thinks that maybe things were a little too intense at the end there. IGN spoke to Kumazaki at GDC, and he had some really interesting things to say about the difficulty curve as a whole.
On the concept of difficulty, he notes:
&quot;When you&#x27;re thinking about maybe your childhood experience playing video games, there might have been games where you just feel like it&#x27;s impossible to beat because it&#x27;s so difficult. And I think the idea is that to be able to provide something that you can enter easily and is approachable, but also provide that sense of achievement in that you might have an experience where you&#x27;re pl…</span>

                              <span>The S-Tier Terror is Back
Bandai Namco, still on a seemingly unstoppable marketing drive, has released another new character trailer for its flashy-looking fighter Tekken 8 — This time around, we focus on the enviable style and undeniable power of one of the series&#x27; most recent addition: grandmaster Leroy Smith.
Having made his debut as a Tekken 7 DLC character, Smith is still a relative newcomer to the Tekken franchise. Turning heads immediately with his slick style and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude, Leroy would make his presence felt in double-quick time, becoming one of the most dangerous characters on the roster and a frequent winner on the game&#x27;s competitive circuit. Leroy has developed a mastery of the high-speed kung-fu form, Wing Chun, which allows him to move with quiet grace and precision, before suddenly unleashing rapid, lightning-like blows on his opponent&#x27;s noodle.

As a child, Leroy grew up mired in the violence of 1980s New York, where gang warfare, complete with integration by crooked cops and politicians would see the young fighter lose his entire family. Brutally injured, and guided by little else but fate, Leroy traveled the world, searching for enlightenment and inner peace while honing his bewildering fighting abilities. Decades later, Leroy returned to America, aiming to stamp out all forms of injustice and corruption wherever it may lay — a path that ultimately leads him to the doors of the Mishima Zaibatsu.
Tekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, and Asuka Kazama.

                              <span>Is there such a thing as too much Ditto?
The Pokemon Company has officially announced the next Tera Raid event battle following the recent Samurott bout: and it&#x27;s none other than Ditto.
The loveable blob returns from April 7 through April 10, and will take over many Tera Raid opportunities during that time (provided that you go online). It&#x27;s a 5-Star raid, which isn&#x27;t too impressive, and it has five max IVs (if you need a Ditto with specific IVs, go for it!). But hey, it&#x27;s content in the eyes of Game Freak and The Pokemon Company.
If you don&#x27;t have a Ditto yet (he can be hard to find in the early game), this event will probably be up your alley! If you do have one though, there&#x27;s not much of a reason to pop in for a 5-Star raid.
That said, there is another known 7-Star Tera Raid on the way, as Samurott returns to the pair of games from April 7 through April 9. That means you can hatch an Oshawott and grab all sorts of 7-Star raid goodies during that period. Oh, and the DLC is coming too! This should be a pretty lively year for Pokemon once again, especially if you&#x27;re still fiddling around with Pokemon Legends.

Capcom has warned of a fatal bug in its recently released Resident Evil 4 that can render progress impossible while simultaneously making save state rescues undoable. The bug, which is present in all versions of Resident Evil 4, can be activated in Chapter 12 of the survival horror adventure.
&quot;Please be aware of a rare but critical progress bug. This issue will only occur under very specific circumstances, as detailed below,&quot; warned Capcom in a message posted to Twitter.
&quot;A cutscene will play at the beginning of Chapter 12, after which the player will receive a key item. Please refrain from attacking with the knife until the notification for obtaining this item is displayed in the upper right of the screen. After obtaining this key item, it will appear in the Key Items &amp; Treasures menu in the attaché case. If it has not appeared, please reload saved data from before the start of Chapter 12.”
&quot;We&#x27;re working on a fix and apologize for any inconvenience.&quot;
Launching on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on March 24, Resident Evil 4 has seen immediate success, shifting over three million copies in its first two days of release and immediately becoming the fast-selling of the three semi-recent Resident Evil remakes. The opening of the Japanese stock market this morning saw Capcom shares hit their highest price ever, kicking off what is set to be an incredible year for the long-time developer/publisher.

With the release of the Jun Kazama trailer, Tekken fans thought that maybe Bandai Namco might go a little quiet on the Tekken 8 character reveals for a few months — But instead, the studio has actually tripled down, offering up not one, not two, but three new reveals in the seven days since!
Leading the pack — at least in the minds of many franchise fans — is top-tier ass-kicker Asuka Kazama!
Miss Kazama made her debut back in 2005&#x27;s Tekken 5, where she immediately won over the hearts of fans with her cutie-pie looks, stoic spirit, and take-no-shit, never-say-die attitude. Something of a more distant relative to the Kazama/Mishima bloodline, Kazama spends her days as a hilariously self-appointed &quot;pacifist vigilante&quot;, who tends to break up/prevent street fig…</span>

Good evening, friends, and welcome back to Whatcha Been Playing? Ha ha! It&#x27;s actually the morning! April Fools I got you good. Well, hardly, but then... I couldn&#x27;t fool someone on the foolingest day of my life if I had an electrified fooling machine. I&#x27;m no good with tricky. I only deal in cold, hard realities. Life has made me that way... And Sertraline. But anyway, &#x27;tis April 1, so be wary of the headlines that you might see floating around the Information Superhighway, as it might just be somebody yankin&#x27; your chain. Chance would be a fine thing.
Anyway, it&#x27;s awesome to see you all here again, and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing all about how you&#x27;re doing and what you&#x27;ve all been up to. We gather on the pretense of gaming of the video persuasion, but we&#x27;re more than that…</span>

Disney Dreamlight Valley is bringing in more content from The Lion King with its next new update — Pride of the Valley
The April update was teased way back at the beginning of the year, and we got a brief sneak peek at it during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct, but now we know when it&#x27;s coming, and what to expect from this year&#x27;s second major update.

Updated with Kraino Origins and Lunark. Enjoy!

Ah, nostalgia — it&#x27;s a tricksy thing. How many times have we gone back to revisit a treasured classic only to find that modern games have spoiled it for us? For all the brilliant aspects of retro games, the mod cons and performance we&#x27;re used to now are pretty fantastic, too, and sometimes going back can be tough. Was this slowdown always here?

Gameloft revealed that Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s next big update will drop on 5th April, but now we have a name and some patch notes to go with this week&#x27;s content update.
Shared on the official website, Pride of the Valley will be available from this Wednesday and with it comes The Lion King Realm, new items at Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s Store, and the Easter Eggstravaganza. Along with this wealth of new content (more below), a handful of bug fixes are also in the works and will be live simultaneously.

Today marks a milestone anniversary for Capcom&#x27;s very first traditional RPG series. Breath of Fire launched on the Super Famicom on 3rd April 1993, kickstarting what would become a beloved franchise for many turn-based RPG fans.
While North America would have to wait until the following summer to get their hands on Capcom&#x27;s first foray into the genre (with Europe waiting until the GBA remake), Breath of Fire quickly established a cult fanbase thanks to its solid turn-based combat, the many anthropomorphic creatures found throughout the world, and fantastic music and art.

Cannon Dancer - Osman — affectionately dubbed &quot;the unofficial sequel to Strider&quot; — will finally be playable on consoles from 13th April 2023 with both a physical and digital launch.
After its original eShop release date slipped from both January and March to April (spotted by gosokkyu, via Time Extension), ININ Games has confirmed that we won&#x27;t have to wait any longer. The 13th April is the day you&#x27;ll be able to sit down with game designer Kouichi &#x27;Isuke&#x27; Yotsui and artist Utata Kiyoshi&#x27;s popular arcade title from the &#x27;90s.

                              <span>Falling into place.
When you’re playing a round of Tetris, the Game Boy title from 1989, nothing is more satisfying than when you line up four horizontal rows perfectly, the blocks disappear, and you get that slightly different jingle to tell you that yeah, you did it, good job. It’s addictive and engrossing, and nowadays there are many different versions of Alexey Pajitnov’s game on various different platforms. Tetris, a video game about falling blocks that was developed in the Soviet Union, was and still is a video game revolution.
Tetris the movie, directed by Jon S. Baird (Stan &amp; Ollie, Filth) is trying to replicate that satisfaction, that crowd-pleasing appeal that Tetris the video game has. But it has a much taller task than simply letting blocks fall. The film has to tell the story of how Tetris left the borders of the USSR, with political tensions reaching a boiling point in the background, and legalities, contracts, and technology twisting into a complicated web, all while addressing two different audiences – fans who know the story, and casual moviegoers (or Apple TV subscribers) who don’t.

Nintendo has announced that a special Super Mario sale will be making its way to European Switch eShops this week, with the first wave of titles seeing a discount from 5th April. More titles will then be reduced with Wave Two of the sale, which is set to kick off on 20th April.
While we have not seen a full list of the titles that will be included in the offer just yet (nor the prices that they will be reduced to), we do know that the first wave will see both Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury and Super Mario Maker 2 getting their prices cut, and it would be fair to assume that Yoshi&#x27;s Crafted World and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze will be joining them if the following announcement tweet from @NintendoEurope is anything to go by.

This week&#x27;s UK charts are now in and this one is once again a slightly quieter affair for Nintendo titles in the top ten, with only three Switch games making the cut.
As is to be expected, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Minecraft appear in the ten best-selling games of this week in fifth and tenth places respectively (it really will be one for the books when they fall off the table) and Super Mario Odyssey continues to sell well in at eighth, capping off yet another week back in the charts.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a kind of game that we all have a fondness for. It transcends genre, even if it doesn&#x27;t particularly push the boat out. It&#x27;s not the first game that comes to mind as a favourite or recommendation, but it&#x27;s a plain good time. Raidborn is one of those.
It doesn&#x27;t try to take over your life, or be the Everything Game that invariably becomes the Nothing Game. It&#x27;s just a neat little thing to have some harmless fun with. Sometimes that&#x27;s what you want.

Six Ages is now receiving its own proper successor later this summer, developer A Sharp and publisher Kitfox have announced. Just like its predecessor, Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out is a blend of tribal management and choose your own adventure drills, all wrapped up in some gorgeous fantasy illustrations.

                              <span>Liam and I played a lot of games at PAX East, like a lot. Most of them we managed to make videos for, but there were many more that we just didn&#x27;t have the time to cover, and that were also very good! So here&#x27;s a quick list of five more games I wanted to spotlight in written form while Liam&#x27;s busy in the editing mines working on all the community videos we filmed (the first of which is out right now, chronicling the PAX Facebook group that takes a community photo every single year). It&#x27;s very wholesome. We&#x27;ve got more community videos coming out this week, plus an article listing our absolute favourite games we played throughout the entire event, so keep your eyes peeled for those, too. For now, though, let&#x27;s dive into some more indie highlights.

                              <span>Solitaire has been a constant fixture for professional procrastinators since time immemorial. Many households, including mine, used the casual card game to kill time - dragging cards, dropping them, and planning sets ahead of time, all in an effort to catch the final fireworks. I was never much good at Solitaire, but as an adult I do understand Word Solitaire, a remixed version of the classic from indie dev Petri Purho.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for being consistent these days. After playing four hours of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor last week, I can tell you it is exactly what you probably already thought it would be: a competent, big-budget action-adventure sequel, well made by talented people, that isn&#x27;t breaking the mould but expands upon the first game in the areas you liked best. If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you. But if you were less well disposed towards that first game, you&#x27;d probably want to swap &quot;consistent&quot; for the word &quot;predictable&quot;.

                              <span>Graham (RPS in peace) text me yesterday and, with little warning, launched into what were clearly pre-prepared paragraphs of complaints about games he&#x27;d tried playing in his free time at the weekend and not enjoyed. I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren&#x27;t able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.
It&#x27;s probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I&#x27;ve started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.

This week, we have immersive sims spraying perfume and hurling fluorscent tube bulbs, motorbike murders, and several journeys with animal friends. Plus, I&#x27;ve been away a few weeks for various reasons, so this Monday I have a little catch-up on some bits and pieces I made notes of last month. Look!

                              <span>ARK 2 has been delayed until the end of 2024. The dinosaur survival sequel currently best known for having Vin Diesel in it, for some reason, was originally aiming for a 2023 release, but developers Studio Wildcard say they need more time.

To compensate, they&#x27;re going to instead release Ark: Survival Ascended in August, a remaster of the original Ark: Survival Evolved that moves it over to Unreal Engine 5. That&#x27;s the good news. The bad news is you can only buy it in a $50 bundle with the sequel (which won&#x27;t be finished for at least a year), and that the original Survival Evolved servers will be switched off when Ascended launches.

The office (by which I mean our Slack channel) was cold and empty, and a shining beacon of light rose from my monitor screen and proclaimed that I was now an honourary Alice. And as such, the heavy responsibility of compiling everyone&#x27;s weekend gaming plans fell to me. To entertain myself (and force those who left me in charge to think twice), I&#x27;ll be writing a series of unhinged 90s-style &quot;where are they now?&quot; epilogues in italics for each person who neglected to send me words of their own.

This week&#x27;s Arcade Archives entry is a particularly curious case, as publisher Hamster has reached right back into the dawning days of the coin-op era to present us with Namco&#x27;s Navarone — Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Released way back in 1980 — the same year that Namco would blow the whole scene wide open with its seminal release, Pac-Man — Navarone is a single-screen shmup that tasks the player with circling a battlefield, blasting away at gun encampments and debris in an effort to destroy the central base located at the center of the screen. It is similar, in a fashion, to titles like Atari&#x27;s Centipede, although it offers more in the way of return fire, as well as movement across three sides of the game screen.

Beautifully, the title attempts to sell the title as an adaptation of sorts to J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s legendary 1961 movie The Guns of Navarone, itself an adaptation of Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1957 novel. One can only assume that this was not, however, an officially licensed Columbia Pictures product, which may go some way to explaining why Navarone would not receive a release outside of Japan. Besides, once Pac-Man Fever gripped the planet, the lo-fi thrills of Navarone would quickly fade into the background.
Navarone is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

                              <span>The squad that stays together, slays together
Over the years, we&#x27;ve seen a few different takes on the Aliens franchise. The xenomorphs have been tackled in shooters, Pac-Man-style mazes, and of course, raw horror. With Aliens: Dark Descent, the player takes command of a crack squad of commandos, heading into derelict depths of space that may or may not be crawling with the multi-mouthed creepy crawlies.
The question, really, was whether a narrow focus on just a squad of units, with individual talents and a high risk of immediate doom, could incorporate the tension and fear one might look for in an Aliens game. The answer is yes, it is extremely tense, and has some really cool ways of conveying the omnipresent fear of the xenomorphs. But it&#x27;s a little complicated.

                              <span>Or, you know, the power of pettiness
Social links are a popular tool in modern RPGs. But Loop8: Summer of Gods doesn&#x27;t just settle for a side serving of socialization. Rather, Loop8 builds its house atop the bedrock of friendship, affection, and yes, even hate.
Developed by Marvelous and published by XSEED, Loop8: Summer of Gods is a &quot;coming-of-age&quot; RPG set in the quiet rural town of Ashihara, in August 1983. You are Nini, a &quot;newly earthbound&quot; teen. And it&#x27;s one month until the world ends. You and your friends must loop through the eighth month of the year until you either overcome the Kegai, an otherworldly threat, or humanity becomes doomed.

I find scrolling shoot-’em-ups to be one of the most difficult genres to talk about, right up there with puzzle games. It’s a formula that has been utilized many times, and frequently the changes are very small. Most of the time, you maneuver your spaceship, unicorn, or spaceship with boxing gloves around on an automatically scrolling background until a much larger boss shows up.
I can’t say that Axelay is much different. The formula could be described as a close companion to Life Force or Abadox where it alternates between vertical and horizontal scrolling stages. Its weapon system is a little lackluster. Axelay is, by most metrics, a pretty flacid shoot-’em-up.
Except, it’s still worth experiencing if you have eyes and ears.

                              <span>The ScummVM project, a free and open-source software project that allows users to play classic point-and-click adventure games on modern systems, has announced a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence gaming.
Thanks to the innovative work of ScummVM developers, AI tools such as ChatGPT are now able to play point-and-click adventure games directly, without any human intervention.

&quot;With this new capability, we hope to explore the potential for AI to learn, adapt, and evolve within the context of classic adventure games,&quot; said Eugene Sandulenko, lead developer of the ScummVM project. &quot;Now AI can experience the joys of helping Putt-Putt join the parade or Adibou count things. We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.&quot;
&quot;I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.&quot;
Update: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:
Getting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.
Taking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
Refusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!

                              <span>Happy Wrestlemania week for those who observe it! It’s the biggest weekend of the year for WWE, but some folks may not realize that it’s also a massive event for the entire industry. The city Wrestlemania takes place in also hosts multiple shows from smaller wrestling promotions, various fan conventions, live podcasts, stage shows, and other events looking to capitalize on the giant influx of fans in the area. It’s a good reminder – or revelation for some – that there’s a lot of other great stuff out there besides Vince McMahon’s billion-dollar behemoth.
The same is true for video games, as wrestling games don’t often get a spotlight without WWE’s branding. Hopefully, this list rectifies that by bringing more awareness to other upcoming titles that replicate or reimagine sports entertainme…</span>

                              <span>Last October, I was lucky enough to visit Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. As a lifelong fan of Nintendo, the experience was immense, providing me with one of my favorite amusement park experiences ever. Naturally, when the first Super Nintendo World in America opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, I had to make the trip to Los Angeles to see how the experience stacks up.
Universal Studios provided me with a day pass to the park for the purpose of experiencing Super Nintendo World. While the photos do little to show off just how cool the experience of visiting Super Nintendo World is, follow along with my experience in the gallery below.
I arrived at Universal Studios Hollywood mid-morning and immediately made a beeline toward Super Nintendo World. The park is in …</span>

After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

Tides of Foscari takes on a decidedly more whimsical tone and introduces eight new heroes. Three of them include the mage Eleanor, the fighter Maruto, and th thief/archer Keith. The DLC also introduces a new stage called Lake Foscari, 13 weapons, 7 musical tracks, and 21 achievements. 
The DLC launches April 13 for just $1.99. This news comes hot after Vampire Survivors’ big wins at the BAFTA awards, where it picked up trophies for Best Game and Best Design. You can learn more about Vampire Survivors by checking out our review here.</span>

                              <span>New academic research shows that blocking pirate site domain names effectively decreases internet traffic and, presumably, piracy. However, widespread blocking by ISPs doesn&#x27;t necessarily boost the use of paid VoD or TV services. When it comes to legal alternatives, the researchers only find a marginal boost in TV viewership.

This report offers considerable insight into the blocking process but also reveals how some of Canada&#x27;s ISPs logged customers&#x27; connections and shared data on their attempts to access pirate IPTV services.

                              <span>The first chapter of Videoverse took me right back to the early 00s last night. I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. 
Luckily, Emmett doesn&#x27;t have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there&#x27;s also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn&#x27;t changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse&#x27;s current free demo that&#x27;s available as part of Steam&#x27;s Storyteller Festival.

                              <span>After a slight delay, The Last Of Us Part I’s PC port released earlier this week and was subsequently torn apart by fans online. The kind-of-remake is still sitting at a mostly negative rating on Steam thanks to reports of frequent crashes and a generally wonky porting job, but some technical problems are getting fixed in a recent patch.

                              <span>With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he&#x27;s ever been from home, I recently realised that it&#x27;ll soon be the longest we&#x27;ve gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors&#x27; Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.
I suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph&#x27;s Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there&#x27;s no new game on the horizon and they&#x27;ve played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character&#x27;s canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph&#x27;s Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?

In this week&#x27;s episode, The Electronic Wireless Show podcast talks all things mods - specifically, the ones that got real big and broke out from their respective source games. It&#x27;s a chat that&#x27;s been prompted by the developers behind Slay The Spire mod Downfall announcing their own brand-new game, Tales &amp; Tactics.  
There&#x27;s also a lot of undead fish chat, and Alice&#x27;s plans for entertaining herself on an upcoming long-haul flight. And in James&#x27; hardware corner, the gang chat about Nvidia&#x27;s comments on AI and crypto, as well as Ubisoft&#x27;s AI writing software tool thinger.

                              <span>Roadwarden was one of many fantastic mystery games from last year, and fans of the text-based RPG can now look forward to solving more secrets from the world with Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale, coming to PC later this year. 


Windy Meadow is set in the same fantasy world as Roadwarden and similarly presents a slice-of-life story that can branch out depending on your choices. This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. 


Windy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”

                              <span>PAX East is a great place to play the latest games, sure, but as anyone who&#x27;s attended the event will tell you the games are just a small part of a wider medley of things to see and do. Last year we highlighted the show&#x27;s thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.


Encouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year&#x27;s show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that&#x27;s a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.


 Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?

                              <span>Indie studio Majorariatto have released small, experimental games every March since 2017 - barring the cursed year of 2020 - and now they’re back with another thought-provoking adventure called Pineapple On Pizza, this time asking the profound question: can video games convey such a complex flavour? It’s out now, it’s free, and it’s only about ten minutes long.

                              <span>Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn&#x27;t even need to lift a single finger.
Playing with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.

                              <span>Man, do I love the feeling of jamming out a guitar riff in games. Sure, in reality, I’m slumped on my couch in a position that my body will give me payback for when I’m thirty, but in my fantasy, I’m a musical prodigy whose guitar licks are so epic it would make Slash cry. My joy for virtual jamming came as a direct result of playing hours and hours of Guitar Hero. Harmonix held my music taste in its death grip, and almost breaking my fingers on those flimsy plastic buttons trying to conquer Through The Fire And Flames is a precious memory of mine.
So yeah, I love a good guitar sesh, so when I saw that Hi-Fi Rush was about a wannabe rockstar that smacks evil megacorp robots with his guitar to a catchy rock OST, Tango Gameworks had my attention.

The remaster will launch on PC and other platforms later this summer.

                              <span>A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.
So what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.

                              <span>Fans of Octopath Traveler have likely had their eye on Live A Live for some time now. Last year, it came to the Nintendo Switch as an exclusive remake of the 1994 RPG. Bu that exclusivity period has been brought to a surprising end as Square Enix have announced Live A Live is hitting PC and PlayStation consoles on April 27th. A demo is available now for PS owners and later today for those on Steam, if you want a preview of the first three stories from the time and genre-hopping adventure.

                              <span>E3 2023 has been canceled, IGN reports. The news comes after major publishers pulled out of the event in recent weeks.
IGN reported on Tuesday that major publishers had either declined to attend or had little to no idea if the event would even take place due to an alleged lack of communication with organizer ReedPop and the ESA. Today, IGN received an email sent within the ESA explaining that the show &quot;simply did not garner the sustained interest necessary to execute it in a way that would showcase the size, strength, and impact of our industry.&quot;
The official E3 Twitter account has now publicly confirmed the cancellation in a brief statement posted below. 
However, IGN received a press release stating that ReedPop and the ESA will continue to work together on “future E3 events”. Whether th…</span>

                              <span>It’s Wrestlemania week, and one would think that the last sport to get into the spirit would be golf. However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.
On April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. 
PGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.</span>

                              <span>We learned last year that Scott Pilgrim is getting another encore in the form of a new Netflix anime series. If that wasn&#x27;t exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.
As reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. 


The primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:
Michael Cera - Scott Pilgrim
Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers
Kieran Culkin - Wallace Wells
Satya Bhabha - Matthew Patel
Chris Evans - Lucas Lee
Anna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim
Brie Larson - Envy Adams
Alison Pill - Kim Pine
Aubrey Plaza - Julie Powers
Brandon Routh - Todd Ingram
Jason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves
Johnny Simmons - Young Neil
Mark Webber - Stephen Stills
Mae Whitman - Roxie Richter
Ellen Wong - Knives Chau
Unfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. 
Are you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Live A Live became one of our favorite RPGs when it launched on Switch last year, and the celebrated remake is making the jump to PlayStation consoles and Steam on April 27. 
Additionally, there’s a free demo on PlayStation available today that lets you play three of the game’s eight stories. Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.
Last year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.</span>

                              <span>Normally we expect to pay around £200 for a mid-range gaming monitor, but today you can pick one up for just £149 after a significant discount in Amazon&#x27;s Spring Sale. This is a great price for the Samsung Odyssey G3, a 27-in flat VA panel monitor that boasts a 165Hz refresh rate, 1080p resolution and excellent adjustability.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that ground pound attacks are better than reloads dumping unspent ammo. 60% against 40%, that one, which is a satisfying outcome. Chunky disagreement but a clear outcome. This week, I ask you to think carefully about two quite different cycles, one repeating and one resuming. What&#x27;s better: time loops, or resuming interrupted reloads?

                              <span>Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year&#x27;s cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. 
It was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn&#x27;t get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC&#x27;s website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life.

                              <span>Are you a fan of RPGs where you make friends with adorable critters? Not a fan of trapping said friends into small balls, only letting them out to fight gangs and other Godlike creatures? Well, Cassette Beasts might be the game for you. It&#x27;s a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves. It looks like an energetic, nostalgic romp, and it’s coming to PC and Game Pass on April 26th.

Last week, Polish site Bankier spoke with Bloober Team’s CEO Pitor Babieno in an interview that was mistranslated and began to circulate online. The mistranslations mentioned the remake was “technically ready” for launch, but Bloober Team have clarified these “statements have been taken out of context, due to inaccurate translations.”

                              <span>There’s always been something quaintly practical about the name Command &amp; Conquer. Sure, there’s a touch of Julius Caesar’s ‘veni, vidi, vici’ in there. But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.

Back then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.

In The Tartarus Key, a PS1-style thriller/puzzle/horror game, it&#x27;s definitely the latter. The free demo is out now, and throws you into the first couple of puzzles for the game as Alex, whose last memory is of being at home in her apartment. Now she finds herself locked in a weird study in a poorly lit mansion, with only a stranger on the end of a walkie-talkie for company. It was enough to staple this game right into the middle of my disorganised Charlie Day conspiracy board of games I&#x27;m interested in, I&#x27;ll tell you that much.

                              <span>The federal government in Australia have today proposed a number of changes to their National Classification Scheme as they seek to crack down on digital gambling and video games that promote it. The proposed changes would apply an R18+ (over 18s) rating to any game with simulated gambling, and an M for “mature” (over 15s) rating to any games with paid loot boxes, potentially changing the classification for games such as FIFA which were previously G-rated (for everyone).

Like any D&amp;D campaign, the crossover begins around a blocky table with an open pizza box, and then it escalates into a roughly ten-hour, action-RPG take on Minecraft as you trek through the classic tabletop’s fantasy world.

                              <span>Yasunori Mitsuda has worked on dozens of games since the mid-90s, but he is best known for his work on Chrono Trigger. The story of how he came to work on the game is surprisingly straightforward. &quot;[Sea of Stars creative director Thierry Boulanger] was like, ‘We have a contact that is in touch with all these people. And he just kind of reached out, and [Mitsuda] liked what he saw. And so he&#x27;s like, &#x27;Yeah, I would, I would love to be a part of this’,” Sea of Stars lead composer Eric W. Brown says. “There’s no words to describe this. Like, it’s… we literally got the guy.” Mitsuda committed to creating about 10 tracks for the game, and the process has been smooth.

On paper, Crime Boss: Rockay City is bombastic, star-studded, and promises a city-spanning adventure about a criminal organization’s rise to the top. The actual game, however, is anything but. The gameplay is unbalanced, buggy, repetitive, and boring. The celebrity-filled cast is exciting at first glance, but crude and humorless writing weighs down the already-phoned-in performances of characters voiced by Michael Madsen, Michael Rooker, Vanilla Ice, and more. The single-player roguelite campaign lacks any of the genre’s typical hooks, and bu…</span>

                              <span>Forspoken may not have set the world on fire, but those who enjoyed it have a new reason to revisit the world of Athia. Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.
The story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. 
Forspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23.

                              <span>Earlier this month, developer Deck 13 revealed that its upcoming action RPG, Atlas Fallen, would arrive May. Now today, less than a month later, Deck 13 has announced that the game has been delayed to August. 
More specifically, Atlas Fallen will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 10. This news comes after previewers recently went hands-on with the game as part of a press event and after the game was showcased at PAX East, which took place last week. As for why Deck 13 is delaying Atlas Fallen, the team says it needs more time with the game.

Deck 13 also revealed that this delay will allow the team to include a full German voiceover for Atlas Fallen.

                              <span>Balsa Model Flight Simulator launched into Steam Early Access last year, to positive reviews and few sales. It is, like its developer&#x27;s previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. 

Now its developer has announced they&#x27;re doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.

                              <span>Company Of Heroes 3 had rough beach landing, garnering mostly positive reviews from critics (like us) and mixed-to-negative reviews from players on Steam. Today&#x27;s release of its first major update, titled Operation Sapphire Jackal, may help address that disparity given that it promises to fix &quot;hundreds&quot; of bugs in the base game. On the other hand, it also adds cosmetics - both those that can be unlocked for free and via spending real money.

This one is a cracker though - you can now pick up a 28-inch 4K monitor for just £181, a great choice for anyone that plays slower-paced PC or console games, or wants a high-quality 4K monitor for content creation and consumption. This Lenovo IPS monitor normally costs £260, so to get it for nearly £80 less is quite a scoop.

                              <span>The Lenovo Legion 5 is a laptop that I&#x27;ve recommended here at RPS on several occasions, as it gets excellent reviews online yet still provides much better specs and build quality than you&#x27;d expect for the money. 
Today though, the Legion 5 is the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen on an RTX gaming laptop, with this spec including a Ryzen 5 5600H and RTX 3060 Laptop graphics card for just £730.98 when you use code CATCH20 at CCL&#x27;s web store on Ebay. That&#x27;s an exceptional price for a brand new laptop that&#x27;s still selling for £1100 at Amazon - Spring Sale or no.

It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel&#x27;s announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.

                              <span>The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson claimed that &quot;the mark of a good action is that it appears inevitable in retrospect.&quot; Had he not died in 1894, he might’ve said the same thing about the Logitech G502 Hero showing up in Amazon sales events, although maybe it wouldn’t have sounded as profound.


That’s right, the G502 Hero – beloved by RPS readers, a longtime resident in our best gaming mouse list, and precursor to an inferior new model – is once again going cheap. A predictable development, albeit an entirely welcome one. This time it’s in the Amazon Spring Sale, with a better-than-half-price discount bringing it down to £35.

                              <span>I was trying to explain the vibe of Crime Boss: Rockay City - a new Payday-like whose main USP is it&#x27;s full of aging 90s-era-ish stars whose unifying trait is that they should not have been hired to do voice work for this game - to Graham as I was playing over the weekend. &quot;You know how police procedurals all have at least one episode that&#x27;s about gamers, so they have to make up a game for it? This feels like that. It&#x27;s like a fake game made up by a Hollywood television  producer.&quot;
A few hours later, after numerous short cutscenes in which Michael Rooker has to shout nonsensical American Football metaphors every so often, to justify the fact that his character is called Touchdown, and Michael Madsen growls about &quot;candy&quot; in a hard-living 65-year-old&#x27;s voice coming out of an uncanny-vallyy 35-year-old&#x27;s face, I text him an update: &quot;It&#x27;s also like that tweet that goes &#x27;Bames Nond&#x27;s having a stronk, call a bondulance&#x27;.&quot;

                              <span>Tax Heaven 3000 changed its release date a couple of times, moving from a March 31st date that was suspiciously close to April Fools&#x27; Day, to April 4th after its removal from Steam, to yesterday, March 27th. For the uninitiated, Tax Heaven 3000 is the anime dating sim that claims to do your taxes and asks you for identifying info such as your email and Social Security Number. It’s likely a joke app, partly because of its waifu Iris (like, the IRS) and partly because it’s from MSCHF, the art collective behind Lil Nas X’s Satan Shoes and other viral drops.

Two, in fact, as the Amazon Spring Sale is currently cutting prices on the super speedy SanDisk Extreme Pro and the more budget-oriented, but still quick, SanDisk Ultra.

To continue playing games or using apps through Steam, you’ll need to update to a more recent version of Windows. After that date, the Steam Client will no longer run on older versions of the Windows OS. The reason? It’s Google Chrome.

                              <span>As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he&#x27;s certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. &quot;You want him to get attacked,&quot; game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase &#x27;you wouldn&#x27;t like him when he&#x27;s angry&#x27; as the basis for Fedir&#x27;s ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it&#x27;s just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.
In truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes&#x27; latest game actually works. It&#x27;s quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here&#x27;s how the game&#x27;s emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.

The Steam page is quick to note, for probably legal reasons, that “this app does not come with games” and “you must own an original copy of any game” you want to emulate. Dolphin allows you to emulate retro games with 4k support, modern controllers, and it’s totally free.

                              <span>Warner Bros. crossover brawler MultiVersus is disabling online services on June 25th until the game’s full launch in early 2024, developer Play First Games have announced. Two seasons deep, the studio say they’re taking MultiVersus offline because it’s been in Open Beta this whole time (I know, shocker), so an extended break will give them time to prepare for their proper launch.

Romero’s acclaimed board game Train inspired the in-book video game Solution, by the author Gabrielle Zevin&#x27;s own admission, which resulted in Romero speaking out. The book’s publisher Knobf Doubleday have now issued a statement refusing to credit Romero since “the only games listed in the author’s acknowledgements are video games.”

In IFPI&#x27;s latest Global Music Report, insiders stress that music&#x27;s &#x27;human&#x27; element should stay at the forefront. According to Sony, the same applies to AI-synthesized voices, which should not replace human vocals.

                              <span>A new character trailer for Tekken 8 showcases the action of the returning Jun Kazama. Jin’s long-lost mother is making her first playable appearance in a mainline entry since Tekken 2, and based on a new gameplay trailer, she hasn’t lost a step.
A gameplay trailer shows off Jun’s expert use of Kazama-style martial arts to cleanse opponents of their evils. That translates to beating the snot out of them if that wasn’t obvious. We also see a brief reunion between Jun and her former lover, Kazuya, and it goes about as well as you would expect from a mother meeting the father and repeat attempted killer of their son. 


For those keeping count, here’s the list of confirmed fighters thus far:
Jack-8
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King
Lars Alexandersson
Marshall Law
Nina Williams
Paul Phoenix
Tekken 8 still doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

If you’re in the market for a new OLED model, this Zelda variant launches on April 28, a couple of weeks before the game arrives. It retails at $359.99 and features a Switch dock and Joy-Cons adorned with Hyrulian designs.

                              <span>Development on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now complete.
The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, revealed this during today&#x27;s Tears of the Kingdom gameplay showcase. He then jumped directly into the game, showing off more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. Aonuma begins this demonstration by showing how Link can get up to the Sky Islands floating above Hyrule. He uses the &quot;Recall&quot; power, which rewinds an object&#x27;s movement, to reverse a fallen rock&#x27;s descent. He&#x27;s able to reach one of the floating sky islands using this new power. 
After fighting an enemy up here, we learn that weapon durability, a hotly debated feature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is back. But now, you can use Link&#x27;s new &quot;Fuse&quot; ability to create brand-new weapons. Aonuma showed us ho…</span>

                              <span>E3 2023 has taken another hit, as Ubisoft has confirmed it will not have a presence at the show. In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. 
The publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that&#x27;s the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. 
As for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  
Ubisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each. It will be the first in-person event since 2019.

                              <span>MultiVersus, the free-to-play Super Smash Bros. style fighting game starring an all-star cast of Warner Bros. characters, will be pulled from storefronts next month. The game’s online modes will later become unplayable as developer Player First Games plans for a relaunch early next year. 
In a developer blog post, Player First Games CEO Tony Huynh explains that since MultiVersus launched in open beta (yes, open beta) last July, players have offered a ton of feedback. The studio feels that the only way to properly implement improvements based on these fan requests is to shut the game down temporarily. Huynh writes,

                              <span>December 25, 2013, was the day I finally got my hands on a Wii U. It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce. For my brother and I, 11 and 13 at the time, respectively, this was a massive deal; we’d spent the last year seeing Wii Us at friends’ houses, yearning for our own, and struggling to explain the difference between it and our current Wii to our parents.
But while it was valuable to us, the Wii U struggled to sell and has ultimately gone down as one of Nintendo’s most disappointing consoles. Today, the system’s eShop shuts down forever, permanently closing a chapter of Nintendo’s history.
I’ll be the first to admit that the rosy lenses of nostalgia heavily tint my memory of the Wii U. It was a formative time in my …</span>

Nintendo has announced that tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, they&#x27;ll be releasing the first proper gameplay showcase of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The presentation will be hosted by Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma, and will last &quot;roughly 10 minutes.&quot; Here&#x27;s the announcement tweet:
Join The Legend of #Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, for roughly 10 minutes of gameplay from The Legend of Zelda: #TearsOfTheKingdom on 3/28 at 7:00 a.m. PT on our YouTube channel.

To watch the video when it premieres tomorrow on YouTube, just click the Link below:
Despite the fact that we&#x27;ve gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow&#x27;s showcase addresses those questions, we&#x27;ll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.
We&#x27;ll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer&#x27;s Twitch channel.</span>

This doesn’t look to be as much of a wide-ranging sale as Prime Day or Amazon’s Black Friday dealings, but there are still some decent savings to be had on plenty of RPS-approved gear, from gaming mice and keyboards to SSDs and gaming monitors.

                              <span>I like to think I have rhythm, in the same way that a wobbly air dancer lunging about sporadically has rhythm. That is to say I have none at all, and that any time spent dancing turns me into an uncontrollable set of limbs flailing in the wrong directions. Think Octodad in a night club and you’d be on the right track (although the disastrous limb flailing is enough to keep me out of the clubs).
That lack of rhythm isn’t just native to the dance floor of an awkward family party, though. Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure. A barrage of borked bleeps and bungled notes tend to leave me with spirits sunk.
In Hi-Fi Rush, though, I always leave with my head held high.

I&#x27;d flirted with the idea for years, but it was the release of BioShock Infinite that finally convinced me to take the plunge. And I can&#x27;t exactly complain: the series&#x27; Rapture arc — made up of the first and second games, plus the prequel novel by none other than John &quot;The Crow&quot; Shirley — now makes up maybe 10% of my personality, having given me two of my favourite video games, my favourite video game tie-in book, and a front-running contender for my favourite video game locale all at once.
I just wish that, after all that prep I did for it, I&#x27;d actually liked BioShock Infinite a bit more.

That&#x27;s a handy £5 cheaper than any equivalent controller on Amazon, and the best deal we&#x27;ve seen for these gamepads since Black Friday last year.

                              <span>It has been said (by me) that a lot of games journalists are generalists in terms of what we play, especially if we&#x27;re talking about people who are staffers at an outlet, or have ever worked in guides. Though we all have stuff we prefer, or series that we serve as the go-to expert on for in-house needs (I think vid bud Liam might actually walk around wearing an ASK ME ABOUT RESIDENT EVIL badge in his day-to-day life), we - unlike the blue-haired neo-Gods of streaming - often can&#x27;t focus on one game all of the time. You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.
There are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven&#x27;t played. Sometimes it&#x27;s because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site&#x27;s knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I&#x27;m not really interested in playing, either because they&#x27;re not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it&#x27;s because everyone says they&#x27;re really good and I have to try them, though I&#x27;ve been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it&#x27;s just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.

Happily, the open world detective sim is now sneaking into an early access release next month, on April 24th.

                              <span>Terra Nil is a puzzle-citybuilder about reclaiming the environment. You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.

                              <span>Slay The Spire has remained an incredibly popular deckbuilding roguelike, so it naturally invited a healthy modding community that added fun stuff to the game - goofy googley eyes included. One of Slay The Spire’s most popular mods was called Downfall, a huge fan-made expansion that added tons of playable characters, a new mode, and more. Those developers - Table 9 Studio - are now back with their own not-modded game: an auto-battling, fantasy Chess roguelike called Tales &amp; Tactics.

                              <span>Rod Humble has his son to thank for his upcoming life sim Life By You. After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn&#x27;t quite sure what. &quot;I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, &#x27;Oh, what should I do? I don&#x27;t know what opportunities there are,&#x27; and he was like, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?&#x27;&quot; And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. &quot;Okay!?&quot; Humble says incredulously. &quot;I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I&#x27;d like to start a studio, and here&#x27;s the way I&#x27;d like to run it. And he was like, sure, let&#x27;s go for it.&quot;
So began Humble&#x27;s journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that&#x27;s set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it&#x27;s currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they&#x27;ve always wanted. &quot;I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,&quot; says Humble. &quot;Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.&quot; And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.

                              <span>I keep alternating between wanting to play more and feeling weary at the prospect. While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it&#x27;s balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.
The Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It&#x27;s a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It&#x27;s perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.

During a chat with Paradox Tectonic&#x27;s general manager Rod Humble at this year&#x27;s GDC, I spoke to him about whether there was any plan to accommodate lower-end PC specifications when Life By You enters early access this September, and he answered by urging players to take its minimum PC specifications &quot;seriously&quot;.

                              <span>You might have heard of Dark And Darker, a dungeon-crawling take on Escape From Tarkov’s PvPvE that’s been gaining popularity over the last few months. Alice0 enjoyed its alpha playtest last December, and it ended up becoming one of the most popular games of February&#x27;s Steam Next Fest. It wasn&#x27;t due to launch in full until sometime this winter, but that window&#x27;s now up in the air after Dark And Darker was removed from Steam over the weekend, following a messy legal dispute between Nexon and developers Ironmace, who have been accused of “using trade secrets and copyrighted information,” allegedly stolen from Nexon.

                              <span>Jokes about Valve’s inability to count to three practically write themselves, but in fairness, the publisher have reportedly reached the mythical number in Counter-Strike 2’s files. The mention of “Left4Dead3” was recently spotted in CS2’s files (thanks, Reddit) which sparked online speculation for a third game in the series. The files state that the “severity” is “high”, the “version” is “2”, but what about the “priority?” Bad news for fans of the run-and-gunning zombie shooter: according to the files, the priority is “none.”

                              <span>Imagine for a moment, if you will, that Persona 5 let you suplex your opponents. Even better, imagine if those moves were pulled off through timing based minigames that resembled the battles found in Nintendo&#x27;s excellent (and underrated) Mario &amp; Luigi RPG series. Sounds good, right? Well guess what, that game exists! It&#x27;s called Wrestle Story and it&#x27;s definitely a project to keep an eye on.


After spending twenty glorious minutes with its colourful demo at PAX East, I was keen to chat to creative director Steve Jimenez about the team&#x27;s inspirations, the challenges of translating wrestling into a turn-based RPG and the  exciting locations that players will attempt to liberate from a group of devious heels.

                              <span>Earlier in the week, Liam and I had the opportunity to chat with Animal Well&#x27;s solo developer and publisher Bigmode about creating their eerie subterranean world. We then had a chance to go hands on with the PAX East demo, and wow, we were both incredibly impressed. Watch the video below for our enthusiastic impressions:
If we could give an RPS &#x27;Bestest Best in show&#x27; award to a game, is would be Animal Well. Liam and I loved the game&#x27;s dense atmosphere, spider-web of interconnected caverns, and creepy creatures that lurk in the dark. We also loves the effects the game has, which reminded Liam of Octopath Traveler&#x27;s visual flairs. If I had to compare it to one game, it would be Hollow Knight, which is very exciting.
We have plenty more PAX East indies for you to check out so make sure you have a peruse through our RPS@PAX tag. A couple of our favourites have been chaotic rouguelite Pizza Possum, Resident Evil-like Alone In The Dark, and island exploration game Mythwrecked.

                              <span>Show me a game about a feral, furry creature with a never ending hunger for junk food and I&#x27;m immediately interested. I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:
What really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It&#x27;s like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.
There&#x27;s an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It&#x27;s goofy fun, and we&#x27;re completeley smitten with it.

That includes Cengage, Macmillan, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as they investigate what appears to be a blatant pirate ebook platform. A closer look reveals even more dubious activity.

Major book publishers successfully argued that the Archive&#x27;s lending of scanned books amounts to copyright infringement. In a decision published Friday, a New York federal judge found that the Archive&#x27;s fair use defenses weighed strongly against the digital book lending operation.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.

He had finally achieved his dream of becoming the Pokémon World Champion and now, it was time for new characters – Loki, Roy, Professor Friede, and Captain Pikachu – to take over. 
Today, Ash&#x27;s journey came to an end in Japan (the dubbed version is coming at a later date) and the English voice actor for him, Sarah Natochenny, released a statement congratulating Ash&#x27;s Japanese voice actor, Rica Matsumoto, and thanking her for 17 years of inspiration.

                              <span>A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.
The news comes from Polygon&#x27;s interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. 
The Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. 
It’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. 
The Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.

                              <span>Daedalic Entertainment revealed The Lord of the Rings: Gollum way back in 2019, announcing that it would be released in 2021. In 2021, however, it was delayed to 2022. In May of last year, Daedalic revealed Gollum would release in September but then, in July, announced it had been delayed once more. Now, today, Daedalic has revealed that Gollum will finally be released this May. 
More specifically, Gollum will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 25. There will be a Switch version of the game, but Daedalic says it&#x27;s planned for later this year. Alongside today&#x27;s news, Daedalic has released a new story trailer. Check it out below: 


&quot;The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is a story-driven action adventure,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Embark on a perilous journey as Gollum, chasing the only thing that is precious to you. Climb, leap, and sneak your way past dangers or into advantageous spots. Gollum is skillful and sly, and torn by a split personality. It is up to you to decide whether to yield to the darker side of Gollum or trust the kinder gentler hint of Sméagol.&quot; 
Check out some new screenshots from the game below:

                              <span>Arkane Studios, best known for creating the acclaimed stealth series Dishonored, has made a name for itself by realizing game worlds with rich lore, environmental storytelling, and curious, interweaving levels. Its specialty is developing immersive sims, a niche it’s helped cultivate since 1999. On May 2, Arkane releases its next project, Redfall, an open-world first-person shooter.
I’ve been a fan of Arkane Studios’ rich single-player worlds for years. Naturally, I had questions about Redfall’s position in the developer’s portfolio. However, after interviewing Studio Head Harvey Smith and playing the game for 90 minutes, I have the answers I was looking for – and I’m excited to share it all in this week’s episode of The Game Informer Show.

                              <span>Last year, Sonic Origins celebrated Sonic the Hedgehog&#x27;s birthday by gathering Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD in one place with new features and some added bonuses. Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection&#x27;s initial launch.
Sonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.
The full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.
Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine
Sonic Blast
Sonic Chaos
Sonic Drift
Sonic Drift 2
Sonic Labyrinth
Sonic Spinball
Sonic the Hedgehog
Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Sonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble
Tails Adventure
Tails&#x27; Sky Patrol
On top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.


Sonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don&#x27;t already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The Nier: Automata tracks &quot;Dependent Weakling,&quot; &quot;Weight of the World Kowaretasekainouta – Marina Kawano,&quot; &quot;Amusement Park,&quot; &quot;A Beautiful Song,&quot; And &quot;Emil&#x27;s Shop,&quot; will be added to the game on March 29. That&#x27;s next Wednesday, so you don&#x27;t have to wait long. Check out Square Enix&#x27;s trailer showcasing these songs in the Tweet below: 
The wait is NieRly over!
@NieRGame Series pack for Theatrhythm Final Bar Line will launch on March 29th with the following songs:

These five songs will join the recently-added six songs from The World Ends With You series. That DLC pack added &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Your Ocean,&quot; &quot;World is Yours,&quot; &quot;Breaking Free,&quot; &quot;Twister,&quot; and &quot;Calling.&quot; Song packs typically cost $3 to $6 depending on the pack, but you&#x27;ll get all of these NEO songs and all of these Nier songs if you&#x27;ve purchased Season Pass 1. 
We love the game, and you can find out why in Game Informer&#x27;s Theatrhythm Final Bar Line review.

                              <span>During Summer Game Fest last June, Alien fans were treated to the reveal of a new title called Aliens: Dark Descent. The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn&#x27;t seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.
A gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.


Aliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                              <span>The Lego Group and 2K have revealed Lego 2K Drive, a new open-world racing game launching this May. 
More specifically, Lego 2K Drive hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on May 19. The game is being developed by WWE 2K and NBA 2K studio, Visual Concepts, and is reminiscent of Forza Horizon&#x27;s open-world exploration mixed with Mario Kart-like racing. If you&#x27;re wondering how we know that, it&#x27;s because we went hands-on with it for a few hours recently, and you can read our preview of the game right now. 
Check out the game in action below: 


Lego 2K Drive is the first collaboration between the Lego Group and 2K but not the last because it is the start of &quot;a multi-title partnership between 2K and the Lego Group to develop AAA Lego games.&quot;

Night Dive Studios is currently led by Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman and is both a development studio and a publisher. It has published more than 100 games, and will add its remake of System Shock to that list on May 30 (on PC). Atari says a key to the success of Night Dive Studios is its proprietary KEX engine that makes classic games playable on modern hardware. Considering Atari is a retro company, and one that just acquired 12 classic retro games, it&#x27;s easy to see what Night Dive Studios can do for it.

                              <span>Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). 
Discussing this with IGN France, Smith said, &quot;We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, &#x27;No PlayStation 5. Now we&#x27;re gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.&#x27;&quot;


Smith said Arkane didn&#x27;t mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. 
&quot;Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,&quot; Smith told IGN France. &quot;And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.&quot; 
News of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn&#x27;t come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it&#x27;s par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it&#x27;s also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. 
A spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: 
Redfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2.

                              <span>Publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have released a new trailer showcasing some of the impressive visual work going into its upcoming Lords of the Fallen sequel, The Lords of the Fallen. 
The Lords of the Fallen, previously known as Lords of the Fallen 2, has had a rocky development history thus far, but with Hexworks taking over development back in 2020, the sequel has begun to shape up.
We got a reveal trailer during Gamescom last year that showcased the game&#x27;s darker, more gothic tone alongside word that this sequel will feature online co-op and a world five times larger than its predecessor. We got another look at the game&#x27;s grisly world in a new trailer released during The Game Awards back in December, and now, thanks to Epic&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation today, we get to see more of the game. 
Because it&#x27;s a trailer released as part of today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation, it&#x27;s less cinematic than previous trailers and instead, focuses on some of the visual design work going into the game.
Check it out for yourself below in this new trailer for The Lords of the Fallen:  


As you can see, The Lords of the Fallen continues to look great, and fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to go hands-on with it because it&#x27;s due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this year. 
For more information about the game, head to our hub for The Lords of the Fallen and then read our thoughts on its predecessor in Game Informer&#x27;s Lords of the Fallen review after that.

Since 2019, the Xbox-owned developer has released two instances of behind-the-scenes footage, with one revealing the game is not a direct sequel to 2017&#x27;s Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice. We did get some gameplay during a trailer at The Game Awards in 2021 but since then, not much. 
Now, thanks to today&#x27;s State of Unreal presentation highlighting the current state of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine, we get another tease of what&#x27;s to come in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II; this time, it&#x27;s a look at the impressive facial animation Ninja Theory has pulled off in the sequel. 
Check out this new Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II teaser for yourself below: 


As you can see, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II continues to look impressive. Unfortunately, we still don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll be playing the game, though.

                              <span>Valve has revealed Counter-Strike 2 and it will be released this summer. 
An official release date was not revealed, but Valve says Counter-Strike 2 will be a free upgrade to anyone who owns Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Plus, if you do own Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you can jump into a limited test for Counter-Strike 2 starting today. During this testing period, Valve says it will &quot;be evaluating a subset of features to shake out any issues before the worldwide release.&quot; 
The company also says, &quot;Counter-Strike 2 is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike&#x27;s history, ensuring new features and updates for years to come.&quot;
Alongside today&#x27;s reveal, Valve has released three gameplay videos for Counter-Strike 2. You can check out all three below: 






Counter-Strike 2 will run in the Source 2 engine, which has tools and rendering features &quot;available for community map makers to make it easier to build, experiment, and iterate.&quot; There will be a Source 2 Item Workshop as well, and it will be available at a later time during the Counter-Strike 2 limited test. 
The official Counter-Strike 2 has plenty of more nitty-gritty details about the game so head there if you want more information. 
Here are some quick-hit highlights players can expect in Counter-Strike 2: 
Upgraded and overhauled maps
Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades
Tick-rate-independent gameplay
Residgned visual effects and audio
All of a player&#x27;s CS:GO items with them in CS2
Counter-Strike 2 hits PC sometime this summer.

                              <span>Editor’s Note: This story’s headline has been changed to better reflect that a voice actor from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 hinted at a September release date, even though developer Insomniac Games has only said the game will be released this fall. 
News on Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games&#x27; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020&#x27;s Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game&#x27;s reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 
According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game&#x27;s reveal trailer), Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 could be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the b…</span>

                              <span>A few months ago, Netflix announced it was partnering with Gears of War developer The Coalition to bring a film and TV project to the streaming service. Today, the company announced the writer on the film project will be John Spaihts, known most recently for his work on Dune and Doctor Strange. In a press release, Spaihts had the following to say about the project:
 In the same press release, The Coalition called Spaihts &quot;a master storyteller.&quot; The Gears of War developer will also be attached to this project as a producer. You can see their tweet about the announcement below.

We still have no release window for the project, and given that they&#x27;ve only just attached a writer, it&#x27;s probably still a few years out. While many are likely excited at the prospect of this movie&#x27;s existence, there is perhaps nobody more eager to be in on the production details than Dave Bautista. The Guardians of the Galaxy star has been campaigning for years to be cast as the live-action version of Marcus Fenix, and was even available as a playable skin in a post-launch update to Gears 5.

                              <span>Activision has revealed that Crash Team Rumble, the 4v4 competitive multiplayer game revealed at The Game Awards last year, will be released this June. 
More specifically, Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Activision has also revealed that a closed beta will take place from April 20 through April 24 and anyone who preorders the game will get access to it. This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. 


The game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season&#x27;s pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings &quot;Blocky&quot; skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. 
Previews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you&#x27;ve played 2021&#x27;s Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. 

Crash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
While waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer&#x27;s Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy review and then read our review of Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time. 
Crash Team Rumble hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 20.

The trailer provides glimpses of Cal’s friends and crewmates Ceres Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin, all sporting five years&#x27; worth of age, strife, and hair (or lack thereoff). We also get a look at a new partner, the mercenary Bode Akuna. Some fresh gameplay clips are sprinkled in, too, as we see the now grizzled Cal duel stormstroopers, bounty hunters, and droids. 


Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launches on April 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. To learn more, check out this story about how the director hopes to turn the series into a trilogy and our interview with star Cameron Monaghan.</span>

                              <span>The first two installments of Syberia are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The acclaimed series from Benoît Sokal follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York as she initially tries to complete the sale of the Voralberg toy factory. But quickly Kate is drawn into a search for the owner which takes her on a journey of discovery.  Join her as she uncovers the owner’s fascination with mammoths, the secrets of Syberia, and a love for adventure.
You will need data files from the macOS version of the games, and a new daily build of ScummVM.  The ScummVM Wiki pages for Syberia and Syberia II include instructions on obtaining those files from Windows or Linux.  Please file any issues you discover in the issue tracker.
