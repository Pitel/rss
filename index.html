To gain a sneak-peek into that world, we asked the A.I.-based text generator InferKit to rewrite some of our favorite games, and the results ranged from hilarious to outright eerie. Below are the A.I. rewrites – the seed text is in bold, and everything else is machine-generated.
Batman: Arkham Asylum
The inmates of Arkham Asylum have been set free – and it&#x27;s up to Batman to bring order to the chaos and take back the asylum. Along the way, he reunites with some old allies and discovers an even deeper secret: he isn&#x27;t the only one with a destiny, and this time, his isn&#x27;t a fairy tale.

                    <span>Hey, look, it’s almost Thanksgiving (AKA Black Friday’s Eve)! Soon, those of us in the U.S. will spend the day chowing down on all manner of homecooked foods. If you’re reading this, odds are you’ll be spending just as much time catching up on the year’s best video games. It’s a lot like treating yourself to a digital feast, and given that Thanksgiving dinner is, scientifically speaking, the perfect assemblage of food, there’s only one way to determine the best combination of games you can play. We must figure out which games are most similar to a classic Thanksgiving dish. Science demands it!

                    <span>After the first series of Resident Evil movies made over a billion dollars in box office revenue, production company Constantine Films is ready to reboot its biggest film franchise. But where the original series deviated drastically from the source material, new director Johannes Roberts – known for his work on 47 Meters Down and The Strangers: Prey At Night – wants to do right by Capcom&#x27;s original games with his new film, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. We caught up with Roberts, to ask what it&#x27;s been like bringing the first two games to life.

Halo Infinite is having a big few weeks. On top of the free-to-play multiplayer suite launching ahead of the full game&#x27;s release on December 8, Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure is also the focus of the latest Game Informer cover story! And what&#x27;s a cover story without a brand new Rapid-Fire interview with the one and only Joseph Staten?
Join us as we sit down with 343&#x27;s head of creative to discuss all things Halo Infinite in our patented scorching-fast style. Joseph was kind enough to put up with us for 117 questions that span everything fans will want to know about one of the biggest games of 2021. In true Rapid-Fire fashion, we have plenty of questions centered on getting to the bottom of Halo Infinite. Who is the Weapon? Will there be new maps and firearms added to the multiplayer suite as time goes on? What happened to Chief and Cortana after the events of Halo 5?
It also wouldn&#x27;t be a Rapid-Fire without some questions you probably wouldn&#x27;t think to ask, like what kind of broadway musical does Chief listen to while slaying The Banished and saving the universe? You&#x27;ll get the answer to that question and so much more during this exclusive interview that you can find above!
Is the wait for Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign feeling too long? We understand and want to help you through this time with our exciting new cover story! This month, we&#x27;re diving into a ton of new and compelling interviews, gameplay videos, and more from the team behind the next entry in Master Cheif&#x27;s story. Be sure to check out our quick looks at the game&#x27;s opening level, our campaign impressions, learn more about exploration and progression, and our look into the creation of the devious bots from the earlier versions of the multiplayer test flights. Thanks for watching, and let us know what you thought of the video in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Children of the ’90s may remember the surge of enthusiasm surrounding Pokémon Snap’s N64 release. Unlike other popular Pokémon titles up to that point, it offered the chance to catch creatures not with a Poké Ball but with a camera. The game featured rushing rivers, sunny beaches, and dark caverns, all stuffed with familiar specimens. The most skilled players snapped – to our young minds – unbelievably realistic shots of these roving Pokémon in their natural habitats while the ever-moving vehicle pushed onward. But it wasn’t enough to capture wild pictures of our favorite creatures. We needed to share these works of art with the world.
Short of parading friends past the home console to admire our digital albums, there didn’t seem to be a good way to do so. Enter the Pokémon Snap Station. I…</span>

                    <span>You&#x27;ve probably seen a million lists online about pairing wine with food or wine with music, hell, even wine with movies. But where are the wine pairings for video games? To address this absence, we talked with master sommelier Morgan Harris about what types of wines go best with which games.
Before we start, we should note that wine and game pairing isn&#x27;t an exact science. Pairing wine with food often results in chemical interactions that enhance or alter flavors; this doesn&#x27;t happen with game pairings, obviously. &quot;Fundamentally, wine is a grocery which means it doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of structural overlaps with gaming, which is a leisure activity,&quot; Harris says. &quot;At their base, they&#x27;re very different things, but there is certainly some overlap and both of them are designed to give plea…</span>

                    <span>Every year, when the daylight wanes faster than I’d prefer and the air chills to bitter cold, I retreat from any outdoor activities and turn to the warmth of my computer. That’s where I sink deep into my chair, crack open some sodas and junk food, and boot up my chosen genre to escape the harsh months of Minnesota weather. It’s when I’m most at home diving deep into a good MMO.
Each winter is a new opportunity to explore another facet of the vast worlds I’ve explored many times before. Usually, my go-to MMO is World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing on and off since 2005. Maybe I never hit the current level cap on the last character I was playing, and that’s my jumping on point, or a new expansion is releasing, and I want to get caught up on the juicy lore and character moments leading …</span>

                    <span>How does a video game from another region make it into your hands, and how do companies ensure you’re getting an experience that lives up to the original? As the gaming industry becomes more globalized, video game localization is an increasingly pertinent topic. But few people actually understand what goes into the process. Preparing to release a game in a new country or region comes with many challenges that go well beyond simple translation.
When a game is localized well, it’s free of typos and grammatical errors, the dialogue is natural, and the instructions make sense. But even this is skimming the surface of the localization team’s role in the process. As games become more complex and text-heavy, not only do the challenges continue to grow, but the quality bar – and our expectations –…</span>

Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.
What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.
What do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

Halo Infinite&#x27;s free multiplayer experience offers many avenues of play, including timed events. This week, 343 Industries introduced the game&#x27;s first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.
From now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn&#x27;t here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.
Most unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.
On top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.
Other items in the shop include the Sentinel&#x27;s Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:</span>

                    <span>If you have family visiting for a Thanksgiving feast and a holiday weekend of relaxation and shopping, there&#x27;s a good chance the younger demographic will be looking for entertainment. If they have their iPads, they&#x27;ll likely retreat into YouTube watching mode, but you can use that screen to bring the family together for some fun game time as well. 
I rounded up a handful of games that should deliver entertainment for groups of kids and adults alike. The difficult task is finding games that are available on a wide variety of devices and offer crossplay support – meaning you can play together, even if you are on PlayStation 4 and the kids are on their iPads.
If you are just entertaining one or two kids, I also included a few games that they should get a kick out of, yet are only available on…</span>

                    <span>A complete round.

When Mario Golf: Super Rush launched it was enjoyable but a bit &#x27;b-tier&#x27;, as we argued in our review. While it&#x27;s still not matching the quality set by some other first-party titles on Switch, three major updates have greatly enhanced the content on offer. Online play is much improved, and there have been multiple new courses and modes to flesh out the experience.

Update: It seems that the games below which were previously listed for $26.99 have had their price increased to $39.99 (or $39.00 in the case of Link&#x27;s Awakening). Additionally, several are no longer available.
Still not a bad deal, but not quite in the I-think-I&#x27;ll-get-the-lot range.

Mirroring a similarly monstrous Cyber Deals sale on the European Switch eShop, Nintendo has announced a big Cyber Deals sale in North America, with discounts on a whole bunch of Switch games. The platform holder is offering up to 50% off (and even more in a few outlying cases) some big titles.
There are too many games to list them all, but these are the ones that Nintendo itself saw fit to highlight. Check out the full list — including more Capcom, Ubisoft, EA, and SEGA titles — on Nintendo&#x27;s website.

In case you weren&#x27;t aware, Polymega already supports original NES, SNES, Mega Drive / Genesis and TG-16 / PC-Engine games via its optional &#x27;Element Modules&#x27;, and the base unit itself can play CD games for the Mega CD, Saturn, PlayStation, TG-16 / PC-Engine CD and Neo Geo CD.

Clockwork Aquario, Westone&#x27;s arcade game that was thought to have been lost for almost 30 years, is now just days away from getting the release it deserves. To celebrate, publisher ININ Games has shared a brand new gameplay trailer.
As you may recall, Clockwork Aquario is an arcade title that was long presumed lost until just last year, when Strictly Limited announced that it had managed to find the game&#x27;s source code. It was originally developed in 1992 by Ryuichi Nishizawa – known for his work on the Wonder Boy series – but was never released; with the source code now in hand, it&#x27;s headed to Switch.

Japan&#x27;s Super Nintendo World, located at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, looks like a place where dreams are made. It boasts an assortment of glorious Nintendo-themed decorations, a couple of rides, more merch than you could ever afford and more, but it&#x27;s sure had its problems, too.
Things didn&#x27;t get off to the best of starts when, just after a single month of being open, the park was forced to close due to a significant spike in COVID-19 cases in the area. In the summer, a large Goomba tower decoration fell down, sparking an investigation to ensure visitor safety. And now, a fire has broken out at one of the park&#x27;s rides – thankfully, no one has been harmed.

Street Fighter V launched in 2016 and has remained a PlayStation console exclusive since then, although it has also been released in arcades and on PC. Capcom has supported the game with regular seasonal updates and DLC characters, with the final character, Luke, arriving on 29th November.

Pathea Games, a studio you&#x27;ll likely know as the developer behind My Time at Portia, will be bringing its latest release Ever Forward to Switch next month, it&#x27;s been confirmed.
Originally expected to be launching this time last year, Ever Forward has now been in the works for several years. A press release for the game&#x27;s launch date announcement notes that the team at Pathea has been busy creating puzzles &quot;with the puzzle gamer in mind&quot;; it reads, &quot;the story and art style are both attractive and good in catching the player’s initial attention, but the puzzles are everything.&quot;

                    <span>Comfortably out of League&#x27;s league.
It feels like the world of Runeterra has just entered the first stages of a great expansion. After being mostly confined to the MOBA for years, things like the new Arcane show, an impending MMO, and some spinoff games are starting to bring this rich universe to audiences that aren’t reached by the main title. Ruined King: A League of Legends Story, is one of those spinoff games, but don’t be fooled into thinking that this is some half-hearted throwaway advert to get more people to play League. Riot knew what it was doing when it handed this project to Airship Syndicate — of Battle Chasers: Nightwar fame — and we’re happy to report that Ruined King has turned out to be a tremendously well-designed RPG. Featuring a memorable cast of characters, incredibly deep gameplay and an attractive art style, this is perhaps one of the most surprising must-have releases of the year.
Ruined King features an ensemble cast of some popular League champions, primarily setting around a group of six protagonists that are ultimately led by Miss Fortune. The main narrative takes place in the nautical-themed city of Bilgewater, of which Miss Fortune has only just recently gained control. Things quickly go awry, however, when evil ghosts — brought in by a substance called Black Mist — begin wreaking havoc in the town, and the crew set out on a journey for the Shadow Isles to try to put a stop to it. Everyone on the team has a different reason for going to the Shadow Isles, and the interplay of their goals makes for some fascinating plot developments as the journey goes on.

                    <span>The Penitent One isn&#x27;t done yet.
Back in August it was announced that the rather excellent Blasphemous would be getting another (and final) free DLC expansion titled &#x27;Wounds of Eventide&#x27;, while Blasphemous II is in development for 2023. Though it&#x27;s a crowded genre on the eShop, this writer&#x27;s view is that it&#x27;s a standout Metroidvania / Souls-like / insert-iffy-comparison-here game from developer The Game Kitchen, so the prospect of more is rather pleasing.
As confirmed by publisher Team17 as part of a sizzle reel from the 2021 Golden Joystick Awards, the final update arrives on all platforms on 9th December, so we don&#x27;t have long to wait to see what it&#x27;s all about. Details are still thin on the ground beyond an initial tease that &quot;His end was just the beginning&quot;, along with some new footage in the video. It looks like a setting that could be a dried out sea, and there are clips of impressive boss battles - including a giant snake that looks particularly deadly.

                    <span>Square&#x27;s net sales and operating income see year-on-year drop.
Square Enix has revealed that NEO: The World Ends With You hasn&#x27;t met the company&#x27;s early sales expectations, despite being well received by fans and critics alike.
In a newly published results briefing covering the first half of the financial year, the company notes that net sales and operating income within its digital entertainment business have fallen year on year. This is despite the fact that titles like Outriders, NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139..., NEO: The World Ends with You, and Life is Strange: True Colors were all released during that time frame – something that Square puts down to the &quot;challenging comparison&quot; created by the previous year&#x27;s launches, which include Final Fantasy VII Remake.

                    <span>Are we in the best timeline, or the worst?
If you could hop into a time machine and fly back to the early &#x27;90s and tell a young gamer that one day, Nintendo would make a piece of Sega hardware, they&#x27;d probably spit out their sugary Sunny D and laugh in your face. &quot;Sega and Nintendo are mortal enemies,&quot; they would retort; &quot;what planet on you from, poindexter?&quot; (Or words to that effect, at least).
However, despite the &#x27;90s being the &#x27;in&#x27; decade right now, we no longer occupy that particular time; today, these two Japanese companies are on much better terms, so much so that – yes – we do now have a piece of Sega consumer hardware produced by Nintendo.

In a new bid to market its popular Switch console, Nintendo&#x27;s been rolling out the celebrities in a new series of ads. The latest to get involved? None other than Jessica Alba.
The American actress, who you&#x27;ll no doubt know from films like Fantastic Four and Sin City, can be seen playing Ring Fit Adventure, Mario Golf: Super Rush and Just Dance 2022 with her family in the new commercial. &quot;Moving along with the fun, that&#x27;s our way to play,&quot; she says.

Ever since Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#x27; major 2.0 update landed earlier this month, patches have been coming in thick and fast to fix a variety of small issues affecting gameplay. Today, the latest update has arrived, taking the game to Version 2.0.3.
Yes, following on from Version 2.0.1 and 2.0.2, this latest patch addresses a duplication glitch discovered by DLC owners (whereby players could sneakily copy items to their heart&#x27;s content) and also fixes an issue relating to characters appearing on the Paradise Planning beach.

Remasters are all the rage at the moment, so a recent rumour which claims that Square&#x27;s Chrono Cross is getting the same treatment should come as no great shock.
Originally released on the PlayStation in 1999 (Japan) and 2000 (North America), Chrono Cross takes place in the same universe as Chrono Trigger, the classic SNES JRPG. The game was developed by many of the same people who made the 16-bit outing, including Masato Kato, Yasuyuki Honne and Yasunori Mitsuda.

                    <span>A list of every Animal Crossing: New Horizons update ever.
It&#x27;s fair to say that Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch has changed quite a bit since it released for Nintendo&#x27;s console in March 2020. The life sim has seen numerous updates in the many months since launch, with new seasonal events, new characters, new items and more added over time — not to mention various bug fixes and tweaks to the base game.
In order to help see how New Horizons has changed over time (and what elements and features were added when), we have collected below the patch notes for every update — large and small — since the release of the game: Animal Crossing: New Horizons version 1.0.

As highlighted by @orcastraw, this glitch was originally discovered by Pokémon player and Twitter user @kevinfor5. Here&#x27;s the full explanation:

From now until next Wednesday, Valve&#x27;s PC game store has... so many discounts. So many. This brings the start of Valve&#x27;s Steam Awards too, with nominations now open.

                    <span>Both of this year’s blockbuster FPSes, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, launched with something up their sleeves: bugs. Even after some patches, these darn creepy crawlies aren’t shaken off so easily. These games are plagued by crashes, glitches, and general instability, to the point where playing them can be as fun as wading through a swarm of locusts.
Halo Infinite, though? The multiplayer component that had a bunch of flight tests? Pretty solid. Sure, a few bugs and matchmaking issues, but for the most part, it’s the most stable multiplayer FPS I’ve played this year. What was 343’s magic pesticide? Time. Simple as. Something Vanguard and Battlefield 2042 are only just catching up on.

                    <span>Bad news, deals friends. If you were hoping to pick up a sweet Black Friday deal on the Oculus Quest 2 this year, then you&#x27;re probably going to be disappointed. Oculus have just announced their official Black Friday deals for their standalone VR headset, and all you&#x27;re going to get is a £50 / $50 voucher to spend on today&#x27;s best VR games rather than a discount on the headset itself. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a decent amount to kickstart your VR library, but the credit voucher also has some niggly conditions attached to it that make it a lot less satisfying than a simple £50 / $50 discount off the regular headset price.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always seen The Sims series as the ultimate life-meddling games. It&#x27;s one of those, well, sims, where it&#x27;s all too tempting to recreate friends and family you know in real life and send them on a path you&#x27;ve chosen. Right now in The Sims 4, players are limited to making life choices for these Sims they&#x27;ve created, doomed to watch Neighbour Sims do their own thing. But on November 30th, the Neighborhood Stories update will let you influence what these NPCs do, from starting families to changing careers.

                    <span>The world of PC parts can be mighty confusing, especially with so many different options popping up almost daily. New technology here, there and everywhere. Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don&#x27;t worry - we&#x27;re here to help. 
WD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung&#x27;s computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman&#x27;s terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.

The battle royale has seen some fancy musical performances, with elaborate in-game events to promote pop stars including Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, but hopefully Harmonix aren&#x27;t consigned to advertising for eternity?

Prodlužuje délku klíčů pro podepisování balíků 2048 na 4096 bitů, ukončuje podporu platformy MIPS64 a nabízí také úvodní podporu pro UEFI Secure Boot. Užitečná je také podpora automatického sestavování modulů pro linuxové jádro pomocí nástroje AKMS (Alpine Kernel Module Support).</span>

Změna sebou přináší též zavedení systému podpory, kdy dané vydání bude standardně podporováno dva roky, následně přejde na tři roky do režimu údržby a poté již nastane EOL fáze.</span>

                    <span>Xbox has announced the Xbox Games With Gold line up for December and per usual, it includes two Xbox One games and two older-generation games. 
Four games are up for grabs this month. They are The Escapists 2 on Xbox One, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition on Xbox One, Orcs Must Die on Xbox 360, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360. Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. 
The Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…</span>

                    <span>According to announcements from both companies, music and rhythm game developer Harmonix is being acquired by Epic Games. 
Epic Games made a statement saying on its website about the company&#x27;s future, saying, &quot;The Harmonix team will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite while continuing to support existing titles including Rock Band 4.&quot;
Harmonix has a brief blog post on its site as well, followed by a short Q&amp;A covering the obvious questions regarding its active support for Rock Band and most recent release FUSER. Here&#x27;s the statement from Harmonix about joining the Epic family: 
For the time being, the company is sticking to keeping its upcoming seasons and events for its games in the pipeline, and won&#x27;t be discontinuing support in any way. Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.
Epic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer&#x27;s Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. 
Does this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?
In a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal.

“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”
TooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. 
However, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. 
“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” 
Meledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades.

                    <span>With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. 
Getting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. 
As you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. 
That’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. 
Head to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller.

                    <span>When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. 
According to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” 
Of course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. 
Do you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below!

Death is one of the few things we all have in common. We all experience death sooner or later, and that can be terrifying because we don’t truly know what awaits us on the other side. Salvation? Oblivion? Death’s Door offers an amusing interpretation of death by framing it as a boring, day-to-day business run by crows. While some of the crows may not find much enjoyment in their work, play…</span>

                    <span>Keanu Reeves has revealed that he doesn’t believe Mortal Kombat to be a good fit for John Wick or Neo. 
It’s always tough when you hear people you look up to say something wrong, but sometimes you just have to power through it and that’s what we’re all doing after Reeves told Esquire he doesn’t want his characters in Mortal Kombat. As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. 
“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” 
Look, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. 
Regardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game &quot;War&quot;, Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic&#x27;s Company Of Heroes does.
So it&#x27;s a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way&#x27;s demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series&#x27; core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.

Kojima Productions have confirmed no specific projects or plans yet. Even as someone who has a lot of time and enthusiasm for Kojima&#x27;s self-serious wacky plots, I hope the plan isn&#x27;t for anything as banal as a Death Stranding movie. Their video games are delightful because they&#x27;re video games.

                    <span>Black Friday is weird. Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

                    <span>I was toiling away in the Black Friday deal mines when I uncovered one that our US friends might particularly appreciate: a titantic $1400 off the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced. This slimline gaming laptop, complete with a 300Hz IPS display, is now only $1600 – close to half price, which is an even bigger deal when the MSRP is the same as a serviceable used car.

You know, Dream Daddy but Dream Detective or whatever.
Thing is, we&#x27;ve got Sexy Young Holmes and Sexy Young Poirot, sure, but two dudes don&#x27;t make a dating sim, right? Why, ITV needs somewhere in the region of 35 fragile young adults to head-wreck every summer in Love Island. So who else would I need hot young versions of for my imaginary dating sim game?

                    <span>Most of Battlefield 2042&#x27;s classic Conquests and Hazard Zones aren&#x27;t my jam, but there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m keeping an eye on, and that&#x27;s Portal. The custom mode editor isn&#x27;t exactly swimming in creativity just yet, but interesting things are slowly beginning to emerge as time goes by. Like Andy&#x27;s Wingsuit Trainer, a course set among the clouds where you wing it through floating hoops as quickly as you can. Bravo Andy. Bravo.

                    <span>I doubt I’d be much cop at counting cards in Vegas, but I have just counted every single item on the patch notes for Precinct, the latest update for Romero Games’ prohibition-era kingpin sim Empire Of Sin. There are over 350 of them, from making gangsters less flirty to giving Al Capone his cigar back on the character select screen. It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. 


“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]&#x27;s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive. The team worked their asses off.”


Thankfully, the launch of the Make It Count DLC - and the accompanying free Precinct update - has been a lot smoother.

                    <span>This Friday is dubbed Black Friday in the USA because it&#x27;s a dark time, when people will literally be maimed or killed in the crush to buy cheap televisions. The lowest ebb of the year before Cyber Monday brings to the light of redemption to the world when kewl d00dz hackers hack the planet. But it does bring cheap video games. GOG have already started a small &quot;Pre-Black Friday sale&quot;, with good discounts including 50% off Disco Elysium and 50% off Cyberpunk 2077. Hmm. I might recommend it at that price?

The free update, which is now available on PC and comes consoles later this year, lets players don the costumes of the protagonists from Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee!, Skul: The Hero Slayer, and Curse of the Dead Gods. Better yet, you’ll wield the weapons/ability of each character. They control largely as you’ll remember them but have a Dead Cells twist.

You wake up in a dark cabin, chained to a worn table. A mysterious man sits on the other side of the room. You can&#x27;t see the details of his face through the darkness, but his crazed eyes pierce the shadows. Something under your belly lurches as he invites you to play a card game. The rules seem simple; you summon creatures to attack your opponent&#x27;s army of foes, and you easily win the first few hands. Still, you can&#x27;t shake the anxiety of what might happen if – no – when you lose. You play on, the eyes on the other side of the table slowly burning a hole in your stomach.
Inscryption is an incredible tone piece that taps into horror …</span>

Not only is Aloy more dynamic and realistic-looking in this new chapter, she’ll also be exploring an immense map with its fair share of cutting-edge qualities. According to lead living world designer Espen Sogn, the dev team hopes that players will “encounter a world that feels more alive and more real than ever.” And knowing the impressive pedigree of Guerrilla Games, this will likely be the case.
The latest blog post states that designing Horizon Forbidden West’s sandbox was all about maintaining authenticity. This is primarily reflected in the cultural norms of the tribes that Aloy meets. Espen mentions two tribes and juxtaposes their customs to showcase the player’s posit…</span>

                    <span>Geoff Keighley’s annual Game Awards show is right around the corner – December 9 to be exact – and a new podcast leading up to the show will dive deep into all that goes into it. 
The Game Awards announced today that it is teaming up with music streaming service, Spotify, which will be its “exclusive audio streaming partner” for the show. It also revealed that leading up to it, a limited four-episode podcast called Inside The Game Awards will be released. 
“As part of the partnership, The Game Awards creator, executive producer, and host Geoff Keighley is hosting a special 4-episode Inside The Game Awards podcast, exclusively on Spotify beginning today, highlighting the latest news on the awards ceremony, including the incredible nominees for this year’s show, and a look at the musical elements of the show, including the return of The Game Awards Orchestra.” 
Spotify will also announce the “most listened to Spotify artists and songs” on gaming platforms globally in 2021 during the show. 
The first episode of Inside The Game Awards is now live, and the other three episodes are expected to drop leading up to the actual show on December 9. While waiting for those, read through the nominations for the Game Awards 2021. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Keighley about this year&#x27;s awards show after that.

                    <span>Hitman 3 has been out for nearly a year, and while its first year of content was expansive, Year 2 is shaping up to be just as big, if not bigger. 
IO Interactive, the developer behind Hitman 3 and the two Hitman games that came out before it, released a new blog post today detailing the game’s first year. IO revealed that Hitman 3 is the most successful Hitman game of all time and that its World of Assassination Trilogy has reached the milestone of 50 million players. It also revealed that Year 2 is starting in less than two months.

“Hitman 3 – Year 2 will start on [January 20, 2022] with post-launch support confirmed for another 12 months,” IO writes in the blog. “New maps, storylines, modes, and ways to play are all lined up for 2022, which is set to be another exciting year.” 
Also, coming to Hitman 3 next year is ray tracing on PC. Plus, PC VR support is coming in January, as is a new Elusive Target Arcade mode. 
“A new way to play Elusive Targets arrives in Hitman 3 in a brand new game mode that we’re calling Elusive Target Arcade,” the blog post reads. “Prepare to take on the ultimate Elusive Target challenge in a change to the established formula in this fan-favourite game mode.

Since before the game even launched, fans of Marvel&#x27;s Avengers, specifically those on PlayStation, have anxiously waited for Spider-Man to swing into the adventure. Over a year later, Marvel&#x27;s flagship character finally arrives on November 30. We&#x27;ve seen his costume and have gotten a sense of his personality in a cinematic trailer, meaning the final questions revolve around the story and how Spid…</span>

                    <span>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition continues to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Just one week after the highly-anticipated remasters released everywhere, Rockstar Games promised the originals would eventually be available on PC in an effort to calm angry fans. The Red Dead Redemption developer released a statement acknowledging that “the updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.” Some players, however, are taking matters into their own hands. GTA Trilogy modders are working together to fix the game.
According to Gamespot, a bevy of issues that range from bizarre typos to immersion-breaking bugs have plagued all three GTA titles. But, as we already kn…</span>

                    <span>The Game Boy-like device known as the Analogue Pocket will finally ship out in three weeks. 
More specifically, the first batch of devices will begin shipping on December 13 and orders are expected to reach customers sometime between December 14 and December 30. This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
If you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. 
“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”
The final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary. While waiting for your Pocket to ship, check out the various features it includes and the accessories that go with it.

                    <span>Kojima Productions is opening a new California-based business division that will focus on movies and television. 
It’s no secret that Kojima, the famed game director behind the Metal Gear Solid series and Death Stranding, is a fan of movies and TV. All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. 
“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” 
Kojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. 
As for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. 
While waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America.

                    <span>A new update for Deathloop is live, and it dramatically changes the way players will make moment-to-moment decisions, both in terms of how they take on NPCs as well as invasions from Julianna. 
Game Update 2 (about as big as Game Update 1) brings a slew of changes to many of the game’s systems alongside bug squashes and fixes, too. The two most notable changes coming to Deathloop by way of this update are that NPCs are a lot smarter now, and Colt will have a harder time avoiding Julianna during an invasion, as reported by Digital Trends.

The CEO told his colleagues he’d consider resigning if the countermeasures in place to combat the developers’ criminally-toxic workplace culture didn’t fix issues “with speed.” This news comes days after company shareholders called on Kotick to resign. Consequently, some of the executives that Kotick conferenced with last week emphasized that a number of staff members want him gone. A “workplace excellence committee” is being implemented, but whether or not the Activision Blizzard work conditions will change for the better, or if Kotick will be true to his word…</span>

                    <span>Following the conclusion of Arcane on Friday, Riot Games and Netflix have confirmed that the animated series based on League Of Legends will indeed get a second season. The only detail they are willing to confirm right now is that the voice actors behind Vi, Jinx, and Caitlyn will return, and I have no idea if that constitutes a spoiler or not because I&#x27;ve only seen the first three episodes. Check out the teasing teaser trailer below.

                    <span>It&#x27;s that time of year again, folks. It&#x27;s the week in November when the sky grows dark, the ground trembles underfoot, and wallets are busted open in the never-ending search for the biggest and best Black Friday deals. You will likely be seeing a lot of these deals posts appearing on RPS over the coming week, but I promise you this one&#x27;s properly good - because it&#x27;s us that&#x27;s on sale rather than a fancy mouse, keyboard or headset.  
From now until November 30th, yearly subscriptions to RPS are 35% off for new subscribers - and all you need to do is head over to our sign up page to get started. No codes or secret password at the Treehouse door required.

                    <span>Rockstar have apologised for &quot;the unexpected technical issues&quot; in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition, saying the remastered versions of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas did not launch in a state with meets their standards of quality. Probably shouldn&#x27;t have released them in that state, then. They say they plan to improve them, and did release a bug-fixing patch over the weekend. They will also put the original versions back on sale, and will give them to people who buy the remastered trilogy.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series. We&#x27;re knee-deep in the Prime era now, and we&#x27;re tackling Samus&#x27; sophomore 3D outing, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. 
This sequel to the acclaimed Metroid Prime was released November 15, 2004 in the U.S. and upped the ante with Zelda-style dark world/light world exploration. Players traverse two versions of a labyrinthine map, solving puzzles that opened paths in the opposite dimension and enduring the damaging effects of the dark world. Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Last year’s The Game Awards show was the biggest yet in terms of viewership. Growing more than 84 percent year-over-year to the tune of a staggering 83 million livestream views, The Game Awards has become one of the video game industry’s biggest events. But we aren’t just tuning in to find out which title will be crowned Game of the Year; we are also there for the World Premieres, which shine the spotlight on new games we’ll be playing in the years ahead. Some publishers save their biggest surprises for The Game Awards, a show that almost didn’t exist.
For a decade, Keighley was the producer and host of Spike TV’s Video Game Awards, a show that started strong in the early 2000s, but fizzled out in 2013 due to poor viewership numbers and criticism over the show’s format. For the 2014 show, …</span>

                    <span>Radiohead&#x27;s surprising collaboration with Epic Games is out now. The Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is a virtual environment designed to accompany and celebrate Radiohead&#x27;s classic Kid A and Amnesiac albums. It&#x27;s an odd project, but it&#x27;s one that makes sense for a band that are often experimental and technologically progressive.

Then they&#x27;ve also made items and costumes available for Rocket League, Fall Guys and Fortnite, turning Radiohead into just another brand to be engaged with in Epic&#x27;s dull metaversal future.

I know, because voting has just closed. If you think you can guess, do head on over to the RPS community Discord, where this year&#x27;s calendar guessing game is underway.

                    <span>It&#x27;s time to break out and dust off your arcade sticks and prepare for a weekend of 3v3 battles in The King of Fighters XV open beta.
Starting tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific and running until 7 a.m. Pacific on November 22, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners will have the opportunity to go hands-on with eight characters out of the final roster of 39 that will be available at launch. The primary function of this beta will be to test out the online multiplayer before the game releases in a couple of months. For the first time ever, KOF will feature rollback netcode from day one in an effort to improve the general online experience when connecting to individuals over a long distance. 
This KOFXV test will feature both online and offline modes, including a training option, giving players a chanc…</span>

                    <span>Having released half of the game earlier this week (albeit in beta), 343 Industries has announced Halo Infinite is ready to make preparations for release in a few weeks.
#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold!

November 19, 2021
In a tweet this afternoon on the Halo account, the message sent was very clear, saying, &quot;#HaloInfinite has officially gone gold! We&#x27;ll see you on December 8, Spartans.&quot; The tweet was followed by a map of release times for regions across the world. Well, specifically when the campaign releases.
Forgoing the typical midnight release, Halo Infinite&#x27;s single-player campaign will see the light of day (literally), landing at 10 a.m. Pacific on December 8. Other release times for various time zones can be seen below, although note that New York should say EST and has not moved into the Central time zone.
Of course, if you want to play Halo Infinite right now, you can! The multiplayer section of the game is available right now on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and is free to play. After a somewhat surprise launch on Monday as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 20th anniversary celebration, 343 Industries unleashed an open beta of Halo Infinite on the gaming public.
We discuss our time with the multiplayer beta on this week&#x27;s Game Informer Show, but that&#x27;s not all! Halo Infinite is gracing the current cover of Game Informer, where we have pages upon pages of information about the game. It&#x27;s technically also the first place Halo Infinite went gold. Game Informer Gold, that is. Check out that incredible ultra-rare print variant here. Also, check out the trifecta of New Gameplay Today videos released today, showing off that now-golden campaign.</span>

To celebrate this milestone, Double Fine partnered with Indie By Design to release a comprehensive art book that details the visual history of every single game the developer has released over the years – including insights from developers, in-depth interviews, and never-before-seen concept art. 
Read down below for an exclusive excerpt from the book, titled 20 Double Fine Years, giving a brief look at the design decisions behind Psychonauts 2&#x27;s Aquato family and the game&#x27;s many, many brains.

                    <span>A week after Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition, the company is returning the original versions of those games to PC.
The PC versions of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas were removed from digital storefronts in preparation for the remastered editions. However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.
In an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, &quot;The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.&quot; Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, &quot;We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost.&quot;
While this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there&#x27;s no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it&#x27;s committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, &quot;We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward,&quot; and, &quot;A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues.&quot;
Last week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes. Especially the sheets of nightmarish rain plaguing Grand Theft Auto III.</span>

Originally released in 2006, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl ushered in a new generation of Pokémon games onto the Nintendo DS. With the themes of evolution and creation woven throughout the story, the upgraded designs of the new Pokémon found throughout the Sinnoh region, as well as newly discovered evolutionary lines of fan-favorite monsters, these games felt like a notable step forward for the franchise. In remaking these classics new Pokémon developer ILCA proves it can handle recreating the crucial tenants of the franchise.

Typically, to get yourself behind the yoke of a space cruiser in Star Citizen, you&#x27;d have to cough up at least $45 for access to one of the game&#x27;s more basic ships. However, like a real-life car show (or a trip to almost any vehicle dealership), IAE 2951 will let intrepid pilots test out over 120 different flyable ships from various fictional manufacturers. Each day of the event will shift focus to specific ship companies and their wares.

While not the first Museum style collection (it&#x27;s a follow-up to 2014&#x27;s Pac-Man Museum), this newest iteration includes popular modern titles such as Pac-Man Championship Edition and Pac-Man 256 and oddities like the Wii-exclusive Pac-Motos. The full list of titles is as follows:
Pac-Man
Super Pac-Man
Pac &amp; Pal
Pac-Land
Pac-Mania
Pac-Attack
Pac-In-Time
Pac-Man Arrangement (Arcade Version)
Pac-Man Arrangement (Console Version)
Pac-Man Championship Edition
Pac-Motos
Pac ‘N Roll Remix
Pac-Man Battle Royale
Pac-Man 256
To access each game, you’ll explore an actual arcade as Pac-Man himself, which is pretty meta. This arcade can be customized to your liking Animal Crossing-style by purchasing decor using coins earned by completing in-game missions. 
Pac-Man Museum + gobbles its way to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC in early 2022.</span>

Battlefield has always been the largest and loudest multiplayer experience in the business. It’s the video game equivalent of Texas, and its bombast cannot be overstated. Battlefield 2042 offers a variety of ways to participate in simulated near-future warfare. Whether you prefer to fight via land or sky, you can experience dizzying on-screen explosions, tense firefights, and more vehicles than teammates who know how to drive them. Unfortunately, Battlefield 2042 is full of almost as many bugs as bad pilots, dragging down an otherwise solid online shooter.

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.

                    <span>The holiday season, heralded by Black Friday, is often a time for reminiscing about the past. For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

                    <span>There&#x27;s no time to explain: the Intel Core i5-12600K has a Black Friday deal. I mean that&#x27;s weird, right? It only came out scant weeks ago and it&#x27;s already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

                    <span>Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour &#x27;n&#x27; puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

                    <span>For all the loathsome talk of the metaverse from companies like Facebook and Epic as the future of reality, many facets of the concept already exist in sandboxes like Roblox. The problem with Roblox for them is that it&#x27;s a lawless frontier town, one they don&#x27;t control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it&#x27;s popular with brands who don&#x27;t need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

                    <span>I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

                    <span>Arkane&#x27;s sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said &quot;stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight&quot;. Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game&#x27;s second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

There are savings of up to £250 to be had here across all of their Vive headsets, including the full Vive Cosmos and Cosmos Elite kits, and their eye-tracking Vive Pro Eye.

                    <span>Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It&#x27;s a beta, they insist. But we all know it&#x27;s the proper game because they&#x27;ve had their betas already (excuse me, &quot;flights&quot;). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

                    <span>During Battlefield 2042&#x27;s week of early access for people who paid extra, players were more forgiving of bugs and wonk with the expectation that it would be fixed by a launch patch. Well, the game is out today, the launch patch has hit, and the game is still in a bit of a state. 78% of the 5500-odd player reviews on Steam are negative right now, with many complaining about crashes, poor performance, and more. Dice have said they plan to launch two patches in the next month.

                    <span>Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

                    <span>Thymesia is an upcoming action-adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the world&#x27;s toughest plague doctor who uses diseases-turned-weapons to battle enemies. The fast-paced action RPG sports heavy Dark Souls vibes and was slated to launch on December 7. Unfortunately, that will no longer be the case because Thymesia is now arriving sometime in 2022.
Developer OverBorder Studio states it wants to make sure Thymesia is razor-sharp for its big debut, so it&#x27;s leaving it in the oven for a while longer. On the bright side, it announced the game is headed to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S after only confirming PC in the past.
Thymesia stars Corvus, a plague doctor who’s half-man, half-raven. He’s on a mission to regain his lost memories while also slaying abominations lurking within his gloomy kingdom. Combat is fast-paced and punishing, emphasizing aggression and mobility thanks to a swift dodge maneuver. Corvus can extract diseases from foes, then transform them into weapons such as a scythe or sword. He can also utilize his raven form to unleash dagger-like feathers. You can mold Corvus to your liking thanks to multiple character builds, as well as different endings to encourage replayability. Check out the original announcement trailer below.

                    <span>Following Sony Interactive Entertainment’s purchase of Evolution Championship Series, more commonly known as EVO, Smash Bros. fans were left wondering what could come of the usual Smash Bros. tournaments featured at the annual EVO showcases. The global COVID-19 pandemic threw its own wrench in EVO’s in-person showcases, but it seems Nintendo is ready to officially support the Smash tournament scene. 
“Confirmed. Ready your A-game, Super Smash Bros competitors. We’ve partnered with Panda Global to launch the first officially licenses Super Smash Bros. championship circuit in North America, coming 2022.”

November 18, 2021
As you can see in the tweet above, Nintendo has partnered with Panda Global to bring “the first officially licensed circuit for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Smash Bros. Melee to North America.” This is especially unprecedented as Nintendo has often remained quite mum on support for the Melee tournament scene. 
It’s unclear exactly what these tournaments will look like – we’ll find out next year – but Panda says they’ll feature cash prizes. 
While waiting for more information, read about Sony’s purchase of EVO and then check out this story about the final fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Masahiro Sakurai’s journey to get Sora added to the game after that.

                    <span>Few genres provide the simple pleasure of a good old-fashioned beat ‘em up. After all, these arcade-style games let you and your buddies punch and kick dozens of often colorful enemies in the face. What’s not to love? Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship. Whatever side of the fence you’re on, we’ve all likely played these sorts of games, and the last decade has seen modernized takes on the winning formula. Here are 10 of the best contemporary beat ‘em ups (in no particular order) that you can play right now. No quarters necessary.

                    <span>Sifu, the upcoming Kung Fu action game from developer Sloclap, has moved its release date by exactly two weeks. 
After it was delayed to 2022, we learned that its release date was February 22. Now, Sifu will launch on February 8 in a rare move that sees it coming earlier than expected. To accompany the news, Sloclap has released a new trailer showcasing more of the bone-breaking combat featured in Sifu, which you can watch below:

The studio also released additional information about the combat and progression featured within Sifu.

Microsoft&#x27;s surprise launch of the multiplayer beta has been warmly received by many of us at Game Informer. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been playing the last few days, and I can&#x27;t wait to jump back in. I&#x27;ll be joined today by Alex Stadnik and Dan Tack, two Halo veterans who will show me how to play this game the right way.

Chances are you already know what you&#x27;re getting with each new iteration of Civ, however, whereas committing to an entirely new 4X can feel like a large risk.

For many of us, me included, that means stuffing our faces with delicious treats like we’re in training for Fat Bear Week. What&#x27;s your favourite? Mine&#x27;s the 
lebkuchen hearts with apricot filling, plus anything with marzipan.
The point I’m trying to get to is that this isn’t really a slim and sexy time of year for me. More of a fat and cuddly (but still sexy) season. On the other hand, this Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is both slim and sexy, as well as a full $500 off in Dell&#x27;s early Black Friday sales.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I came down on the side of basically liking Age Of Empires 4. Lukewarm praise, perhaps, but it seems to be doing well, and that makes me glad. We&#x27;ve needed an RTS revival for ages, right? And this one is good, if a bit safe.
For the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?

                    <span>At long last, we have a date for Minecraft&#x27;s Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 2 update. On November 30th, Mojang will give the game&#x27;s mountains and caves a makeover, adding new sub-biomes and letting folks explore deeper than before. I&#x27;m very much looking forward to the new Lush Cave biomes, which are gonna be full of vines, moss and pretty blossoms. I reckon that would make a lovely location for an underground home.

                    <span>Warner Bros. today announced a Smash Bros-style platformer fighter of their own, throwing characters from across their many series and franchises into one big rumble. In MultiVersus, you can expect to see Shaggy from Scooby Doo teaming up with Steven Universe to battle actual killers like Harley Quinn and Arya Stark, and more. It&#x27;s due to launch in 2022, and will be free-to-play. Check out the trailer below.

                    <span>I can&#x27;t remember why I picked this theme, but for this episode of The Electronic Wireless Show podcast I wanted to talk about AI characters - as in, characters that are, in game, an artificial intelligence of some kind. This definition does cause some trouble. After all, is not every character in a game that isn&#x27;t player controlled an AI character, fn fn fn?
No, because you all know what I mean and so does Nate. Matthew doesn&#x27;t, know, and had prepared a list of just, companion characters. Don&#x27;t worry, he actually pulls out some really good examples. We talk about a lot of games this week, not least because I didn&#x27;t prepare a Cavern Of Lies again. Sorry. There is also a lot of talk about clones, and what Matthew would do with clones of himself (e.g. shove them out of an airlock).

                    <span>Supercars are boring. That one on Forza Horizon 5’s front cover? Don’t care how fast it goes, mate. Oh, goes from 1 to 60 in 2.7 seconds does it? Yeah, well, that&#x27;s how long it takes to prepare this knuckle sandwich. No, but seriously, they’re all the same to me: just wedges of carbon fibre with wheels. I’m sure the engineering is marvelous and the innovation groundbreaking. But let’s be honest, in videogames they’re virtually all the same.
My Forza Horizon 5 fantasy doesn’t involve Lamborghinis or Ferraris. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of opulence. Mexico’s roads are for me and my mundane companions. The Volvo Estate, the Ford Focus, the Honda Civic. The everyday vehicles that make up for their lack of speed with heaps of character. I just wish there were more to choose from.

                    <span>Undungeon is a peculiar action RPG set at the end of the universe, in which you play an immortal herald called Void who has been pieced together by God themselves using a primordial stew of hot organs, conscious essence and wet rib cages. Something very complicated has happened to reality, and you’re here to fix it with your swooshing Freddy Kreuger claws and clever dialogue choices. 


I’m still not entirely sure what Undungeon is about. The characters, a cast of hovering orbs, corrupted flesh angels and crystal beings, repeatedly try to explain what’s going on, but it never quite sinks in. Collapsing dimensions are causing no end of trouble, that’s pretty clear, shattering into an infinite number of spinning shards that rain like an exotic meteor shower over a scorched wasteland inhabited by nomadic technomancers and acid-spitting scorpions. You’re sent down to the dusty mortal plane to plug everything back in again and reset the multiverse, like an interdimensional BT engineer.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been struggling with crashes or online stability in Forza Horizon 5, it&#x27;s probably worth updating your game. Last night, Playground Games released a patch for the new open-world race &#x27;em up, fixing a number of crashes that can occur when upgrading cars or spawning traffic, and improving stability for Horizon Life (the game&#x27;s online component). This hotfix was supposed to arrive last week, but better late than never.

                    <span>Yesterday, I reported that 343 Industries were looking into Halo Infinite&#x27;s battle pass progression, which players have found overwhelmingly slow so far. Our very own Ed Thorn played for four hours, only to reach battle pass level 3 the other night. Thankfully, the developers have already detailed a handful of changes coming this week that should improve things - from adding new, easier challenges, to removing some of the rubbish weeklies players don&#x27;t like.

                    <span>Despite my interest in pirates, piracy is probably the least interesting thing about Sea Of Thieves. It&#x27;s not just its excellent ocean that I want to enjoy without pointless random murder. It&#x27;s the sailing. The thrill of moving around and operating this vehicle, hearing it creak as you turn a wheel, and whoosh as you catch the wind.
Sailwind is all about that. You sail a boat. Nobody will attack you. There are no monsters to fight, or guilds to appease. It&#x27;s just you, the sea, and the skills that will take your boat across it well enough that you don&#x27;t starve on the way.

                    <span>If you haven’t heard, we&#x27;re in the middle of an indiepocalypse. It’s probably not the kind you’re thinking of; it doesn’t spell doom for the independent games scene. This one is a monthly compilation of games all in one conveniently packaged digital zine, from a variety of diverse creators. That Indiepocalypse. 


Indiepocalypse is composed of 10 games every month, one of which has been commissioned by Editor in Chief Andrew Baillie personally. Started in February 2020, the zine has already managed to rack up 22 issues, as well as one bonus issue. You never know what you’re going to get from one issue to the next, each one platforming small games that likely wouldn’t succeed elsewhere. There’s no exclusivity clause either, meaning developers are free to do what they want with their games outside of the zine. Most importantly, every developer included is paid. Baillie spoke to me about how and why Indiepocalypse started.

                    <span>Developers 343 Industries surprise-launched Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer this week on Xbox&#x27;s 20th birthday, and so far it seems that folks are finding it fairly fun to play. But a lot of players have one major grievance: the battle pass is a massive grind. Complaints about challenges that award very little XP are all over the game&#x27;s subreddit. Fortunately, the devs have seen this feedback, and are already looking into the slow progression.

                    <span>There’s something about Call Of Duty: Vanguard and its multiplayer modes that feels thin. Much like my time with the game’s campaign, I’m left wanting. This is a World War II veneer glossed over a Modern Warfare canvas, with familiar pacing and shooting, but ultimately lacking the weight of Infinity Ward’s reboot.
As a Call Of Duty multiplayer experience, Vanguard delivers. But what it delivers is a stop-gap. An FPS experience that isn’t concerned with pushing the series forwards, or taking risks. Fans will have fun, sure, but its deathmatches and dominations are stuck in the past. Not to mention Zombies, which is too eager to turn back the clock.

                    <span>Over 150 Activision Blizzard employees held a walkout yesterday demanding the removal of CEO Bobby Kotick, after a new report unearthed more allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. The Wall Street Journal even claim that Kotick himself had allegedly threatened to have someone killed. This is the second walkout workers have held this year following the first lawsuit that made allegations of widespread discrimination and harassment.

                    <span>Less than three months after announcing the reboot Saints Row, the makers have announced they&#x27;re delaying its launch by six months. Previously due on February 25th, 2022, it&#x27;s now due on August 23rd. It&#x27;s the usual sensible reason: the pandemic has messed with anyone attempting to do anything, and they want more time to make it good. Please do!

                    <span>New World, Amazon Games&#x27; opening move into game dev, was not always an MMORPG. It used to be a survival horror game. According to Katy Kaszynski, senior producer at Amazon Games, the team got really far down that road. &quot;They created it. That was before my time, but that game was almost done,&quot; Kaszynski tells me, just after delivering a presentation on New World&#x27;s development at this year&#x27;s Develop Conference in Brighton. &quot;They really thought it was going to go alpha, launch, and they were going to ship that out.&quot;
A survival horror is pretty different from the jaunty, vaguely piratical, magical fantasy RPG that New World is today: lush forests, sunny grassy plains, and factions engaged in an endless war for territory. So what happened? According to Kaszynski, it&#x27;s all down to Amazon&#x27;s first &#x27;Leadership Principle&#x27;: Customer Obsession.

                    <span>A report by the Wall Street Journal has brought to light several new examples of alleged misconduct by Activision staff, including rape and sexual harassment. The report also highlights several instances where Activision CEO Bobby Kotick was reportedly aware of the allegations but did not inform the company&#x27;s board of directors and, in one instance, intervened to prevent an alleged harasser from being fired.

In response to the report, employee group A Better ABK have called for Kotick to be replaced as CEO and are organising a staff walkout.

                    <span>Though Halo started out on Macs then joined Microsoft, historically the series hasn&#x27;t had much of a presence on personal computers. At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that&#x27;s changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?

                    <span>Today, Bandai Namco announced Dragon Ball: The Breakers, which is perhaps the most baffling game to be revealed this year. It&#x27;s a 7v1 survival horror game where a group of players have to escape a &quot;raider&quot; using all sorts of weird and wonderful abilities. It&#x27;s like Dead By Daylight meets Prop Hunt. Truthfully, when I first watched the trailer I was convinced they&#x27;d just put Cell in Dead By Daylight. Like, why not?

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t really have the luxury of devoting a cool 500 words to a single character in my Sherlock Holmes Chapter One review, firstly because I&#x27;m a believer in word economy, but secondly because what I wanted to talk about is a bit of a spoiler. It&#x27;s integral to the plot of the game and it&#x27;s revealed very quickly once you start playing, but it&#x27;s also not mentioned in any of the promo blurbs or marketing, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s meant to be a fun little &quot;Oh!&quot; moment. On the other hand, I do really want to talk about how cool Sherlock&#x27;s best mate Jon is...
So if you want to go into Frogwares&#x27; new detect &#x27;em up cold, then save this and come back to it after you&#x27;ve played about, ooh, 45 minutes? I think that&#x27;s long enough to get clear of spoiler territory.

                    <span>When Microsoft bought Bethesda last year, it raised questions about which consoles their future games would end up on. It&#x27;s not a huge drama for us in PC land, Microsoft already offer most of their new stuff to us and the Xbox lot. But for PlayStation owners, the drama has arrived. Phil Spencer says he sees The Elder Scrolls 6 as a PC and Xbox exclusive, the same as Starfield.

                    <span>Dying Light 2, like its predecessor, knows that its setting is as much of a sell as its gameplay. The development team at Techland has moved on from Dying Light’s setting of Harran in a nuclear-powered ‘salt the earth’ parting blow, and has shifted focus to Villedor. You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas. It’s not just more of the same Dying Light.

                    <span>Windows has contributed two iconic images to the public consciousness: the default Windows XP wallpaper; and the blue screen of death. But they cut Bliss decades ago, and Windows 11 put the final nail in the coffin of Windows&#x27; pop culture relevancy by turning the blue screen of death into a black screen of death. A tragedy. Thankfully, Microsoft have now seen the cerulean light, and are planning to restore the azure annihilator in a future patch.

But fortunately, modders have stepped in, making improvements to the game&#x27;s rain, fixing typos, adding in lots of nice graphics options and more. One modder has even fixed the nut on the Tuff Nut Donuts sign, which, for some baffling reason, had been rounded out.

Route-one, 4-4-2, and no &#x27;larking about&#x27;. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.
Hattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It&#x27;s been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football&#x27;s favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they&#x27;ve had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.

                    <span>Moncage is one of those puzzle games of intermittent lightbulb moments. One minute you see solutions with perfect clarity. The next you&#x27;re left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you&#x27;re meant to proceed. It wouldn&#x27;t be much of a puzzle game if there weren&#x27;t a few moments like this, of course, but when you&#x27;re playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you&#x27;re really desperate, an in-game video solution). 
When the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion&#x27;s debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios&#x27; The Room series. It&#x27;s a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.

If you get banned for cheating, they&#x27;ll ban you from the whole Call Of Duty series (well, as much as accounts allow). Eat it, nerks.

During a stream today they announced a big free update is coming to People Can Fly&#x27;s looter-shooter on Tuesday, with a full expansion to follow in 2022. This week&#x27;s free additions will include new Expeditions and a transmogrification system so you can make your wizards look all fancy.

The FPS&#x27;s full multiplayer launched today into open beta, though it has all the maps and modes, it is the official start of the first season, and all progress will carry over, so basically it&#x27;s out now, just might be a bit wonky. Hinfinite&#x27;s multiplayer side is free-to-play so all are invited.

                    <span>The simple explanation of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a game where you embody the nascent consulting detective, aged 21, returning to Cordona, the Mediterranean island where he spent time as a child. It&#x27;s a third-person puzzle adventure. You gather the evidence, cross reference it all, and then come to a conclusion on the case. Young Holmes returned to Cordona to find out how his mum died a decade ago, and is helped by his best mate Jon, this season&#x27;s Creepy Watson. Boy, do they get in some scrapes along the way! Bingo, bango, there&#x27;s yer preamble.
But the complex explanation is that this game, ironically, defies explanation. As I played, I oscillated wildly between thinking, &quot;This is Frogwares&#x27; world and we&#x27;re all just living in it!&quot; and, &quot;What is even happening, what is this, I need a ten-part documentary series that just follows the developers around because they really have a lot of explaining to do.&quot;

                    <span>Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics, a full team of developers behind it called Aljo Games, and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator Alex Johansson made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion (together with custom controller designer Katy Marshall), but he&#x27;d also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. 
Obviously, you don&#x27;t need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don&#x27;t technically need the telegraph machine either, as there&#x27;s an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn&#x27;t half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.

                    <span>Last year, Wales Interactive released Maid Of Sker, a first-person survival horror set in a creepy hotel. It&#x27;s your typical kinda horror experience - a singleplayer romp making you solve puzzles and linger in horrible places while trying to avoid spooks. You might expect that a second Sker-y game would follow a similar formula. Nope. This weekend, the developers announced Sker Ritual, a co-op shooter in which you&#x27;ll need to survive an onslaught of ghouls.

It&#x27;s an open-world RPG set in a plague-ravaged medieval world, where you&#x27;ll lead a pack of mercenaries as you all try to survive. I played the demo this summer, and it&#x27;s good! It&#x27;s a simple ye olde setting, no magic or wizards, but also has no main quests to bog you down. You&#x27;re free to follow little story threads as you please, or just exist in the harsh world with your merc pals.

                    <span>&quot;Sometimes a bit of difficulty can add a lot of replayability, but as of right now there are issues and bugs we&#x27;ve encountered in development that are making it far more difficult than intended,&quot; Back 4 Blood developers Turtle Rock Studios have said. The Left 4 Dead-style monster-mashing has become notably more difficult following the big November update, with undesireable consequences, and they laid out plans to remedy it.

                    <span>Server transfers were introduced to New World last month, letting players boot their characters to a new world. It was implemented as a way to ease queue times in the popular MMORPG, but didn&#x27;t work completely to plan - it caused a gold duping glitch, and some players have been blocked from transferring altogether. Amazon Games say they&#x27;re currently working on resolving these blockages, and are planning a second round of server transfers before the year&#x27;s end, so everyone has a chance to jump worlds.

The remastered collection of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas looks a right mess but apparently the reason for its vanishing was they had accidentally left in files they shouldn&#x27;t have, which include songs that weren&#x27;t meant to be in the game. Well, it&#x27;s back on sale now, and it still looks a mess. Hey Rockstar, maybe now consider putting the original versions back on sale too.
