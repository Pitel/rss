However, in a new Xbox-focused documentary, Microsoft seems to regret how it handled Lionhead, as reported by IGN. 
Power On: The Story of Xbox was announced back in November, and now, the six-part documentary is available for viewing. Running over four hours long, this documentary series covers the entire history of Xbox, including its closure of Lionhead five years ago. Xbox general manager of global games publishing, Shannon Loftis, revealed how the company considered this closure and how it was handled.

                    <span>The multiplayer team behind Halo Infinite said near the start of December that it’s working on adding Fiesta, Tactical Slayer (Swat), and Free-For-All playlists to Halo Infinite before the end of the year. It also said that while it’s working on a Slayer playlist, it won’t be ready until 2022. 
343 Industries is making all of your holiday wishes come true this December because it announced that Fiesta, Tactical Slayer, FFA, and Slayer playlists go live tomorrow. This news comes from Halo Infinite lead multiplayer designer Andrew Witts, who announced that all four new playlists launch tomorrow, December 14.

My Nintendo serves up some decent physical rewards at times, and the latest to arrive in Europe is a Metroid Dread Pin Set, showcasing Samus and an E.M.M.I doing &quot;I&#x27;m ready to fight&quot; poses.
Well, we all like pins for going on our lapels, bags or specially designed pin boards for our collectible pins (that&#x27;s a thing, right?). They&#x27;re available for 500 Platinum Points plus shipping (which will vary depending on your country), with the relevant links below.

With systems like the Nt Mini, Super Nt and Mega Sg under its belt, Analogue has developed an enviable reputation in the world of retro gaming hardware. While its products are often in painfully short supply – a fact which has led to quite a lot of resentment from potential buyers – they&#x27;re never anything short of remarkable. Unlike many of its rivals, Analogue doesn&#x27;t go down the route of software emulation but instead utilises FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) chips to reproduce vintage systems on what is effectively a hardware level – a more expensive approach, for sure, but with one considerable benefits, such as unprecedented accuracy and wide-ranging support for as many games as possible.
The launch of the company&#x27;s latest product has, like so many in the tech world, been impacted by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Thankfully, we can report that the Analogue Pocket has been worth the wait; the firm&#x27;s first attempt at a portable system has all the hallmarks of a device you&#x27;d associate with the Analogue name and actually goes way beyond what you&#x27;d assume a system like this would be capable of.

As its 2022 release draws ever closer, upcoming point-and-click Adventure Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER has been treated to a brand new trailer.
Shared by developer MidBoss, the new clip gives us a fresh glimpse at the game&#x27;s psychic protagonist ES88 and some of the diverse cast she&#x27;ll be meeting in the game&#x27;s cyberpunk-style world. The game sees ES88 hoping to repair people&#x27;s memories with the help of a bioengineered psychic creature called the Neurodiver, hence the name of the game.

Sometimes just before his boss battle, Specter Knight will warn you, “All who play Pocket Dungeon’s deadly game will be consumed by it.” He’s certainly right. Yacht Club’s newest spin-off of its critically lauded Shovel Knight franchise is, in a word, addictive.
It’s easy to look at Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon and think it’s just an interesting, but very skippable sidestep in the series while we wait for the next mainline game. Yet, to pass on this would be to miss out on a tightly designed, highly refined, and refreshingly original take on the falling block puzzler genre. There is more to Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon than you may first think, and we’d say it comfortably meets the wonderfully high-quality standards of Yacht Club’s previous work.

                    <span>&quot;The system continues to see strong demand&quot;.
It&#x27;s fair to say that the majority of us on these pages have had a Switch either since day one or - at the very least - for quite some time. Yet with some households double-dipping and new gamers still being drawn to the system, Nintendo has continued to deliver strong momentum for the console / portable hybrid.
That&#x27;s been reinforced with the November NPD hardware figures for the US market, with Nintendo going so far as to highlight its market leading results. A combination of standard, Lite and OLED models shifted over one million units in November in the US alone, while also leading the way over the vital Thanksgiving / Black Friday sales week.

Still looking to get your hands on a shiny new Nintendo Switch OLED? Are you maybe thinking of treating a loved one for Christmas, or just wanting a nice treat for yourself? Well, this new deal is likely to be among the cheapest you&#x27;ll find.
The Neon Red/Blue version of the console, which is also available in white, has been reduced to £305.07 over on Amazon UK (down from its RRP of £309.99). It&#x27;s a small discount, but every penny counts when it comes to making it through the holidays.

Developer Dinosaur Polo Club recently unveiled a notable update for the charming road management sim, called Challenge City Update. It&#x27;ll add new content and a few key features to the various city projects, which will certainly add new life to the game for those already playing.

A modder has made Christmas-themed outfits for Blackwall and Solas, turning them into Santa Claus and his little elven helper. That&#x27;s right, you can now dress up a literal God and potential big bad of the future Dragon Age games as a merry red and green-clad lad. It&#x27;s what he deserves.

                    <span>I usually don&#x27;t like comparing games when I review them, but I have a funny feeling I&#x27;m not the only one that was reminded of other moody puzzle-platformers when I first saw White Shadows. It&#x27;s a game that features a monotone colour pallette, a dystopian setting, an incredibly abstract story and the first few minutes had me pushing around boxes to get past obstacles, so yes, it will remind you of Playdead&#x27;s Limbo or Inside. White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.

                    <span>Later today, Ubisoft will announce something new for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. They&#x27;re not yet saying what it is but because Ubisoft either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t keep a secret, leaks have sprung up. According to supposed screenshots and store info, it&#x27;s an expansion named Dawn Of Ragnarok with a lot of fantasy fanciness, journeying into Norse legend with Odin and dwarves and giants and that.

                    <span>While the Pacific map in Call Of Duty: Warzone ushered in a new WW2 era of beachside battle royale, it also added weapon bloom. Swings and roundabouts, or in this case, new islands and a frustrating feature that meant some of your shots wouldn&#x27;t hit their target. Thankfully Raven Software realised it wasn&#x27;t the most popular addition to the game and have begun the process of patching it out entirely. But it&#x27;ll take time to fully remove.

                    <span>Have you been wondering what ol’ Peter Molyneux has been up to lately? Well, in a move that very few will find surprising, the infamous designer is jumping into the world of blockchain gaming and NFT bullshit.

Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon launches tomorrow and offers an intriguing change of pace for everyone’s favorite shovel-wielding hero/obligatory indie cameo star.

Keeping up with all the releases coming to the Switch eShop on a weekly basis can be a challenge, but what a fantastic problem to have!

                    <span>Jeff Fowler thinks he &quot;absolutely nailed it&quot;.
Knuckles the Echidna will make his debut in the upcoming film Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and if you&#x27;ve got any concerns about how he&#x27;ll be adapted to the big screen, there&#x27;s no need to worry.
During an interview with Polygon, returning director Jeff Fowler revealed how the voice of Knuckles, Idris Elba, was equally as concerned about getting the famous Sega character &quot;right&quot; to ensure he ended up being the &quot;best version&quot;.

‘Tis the season of enforced family gatherings, far too much of every food imaginable, and TV schedules filled with unnecessary modern remakes of old favourites. It’s also the perfect opportunity to stuff a controller in granddad’s hands and demonstrate the joys of gaming with those who might normally avoid it, bringing family young and old together in one single harmonious Nintendo-branded activity. Anything to avoid another dull game of Monopoly that lasts until 11pm the next day.
Would-be Nintendo missionaries have a captive audience over the holidays without having to ‘accidentally’ spill superglue on someone’s chair like last time. Couch multiplayer is always the best kind of multiplayer and you already own the most portable and unfussy modern gaming console on the planet. Conditions are perfect!

The Sonic Frontiers announcement trailer didn&#x27;t exactly reveal much, but it certainly left us wanting to know more.
While we already know the game&#x27;s narrative is being handled by Ian Flynn - the head writer of IDW&#x27;s current Sonic the Hedgehog comic, we&#x27;ve now reportedly got Sonic Frontiers&#x27; plot synopsis as well. This information was shared by Polygon (via Sonic Stadium) and reveals Dr. Eggman is once again up to no good.

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography has explored the history of the Metroid series, but it&#x27;s time to wrap the season by talking about, arguably, the biggest Nintendo game of the year: Metroid Dread.
On October 8, 2021, Metroid Dread was released for Nintendo&#x27;s Switch. Nintendo heralded the title as the end of an era for the series, but considering how well it&#x27;s selling, it could also be the beginning of another golden age. Oddly, Dread might have one of the longest teases in history, as its name first appeared back in 2005. In this week&#x27;s show, we talk about our problems with the game&#x27;s controls, what we thought of the difficulty, and what its big narrative reveal means for Samus&#x27; future. 
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, soon-to-be-GameSpot-editor Jessica Howard (@awildjessichu) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Dread&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

Updated with Danganronpa Decadence. Enjoy!

The portability of Nintendo Switch makes it a great system to play a wide variety of genres, and while visual novels can be enjoyed perfectly well on your TV, there&#x27;s something about playing them on a handheld which just feels &#x27;right&#x27;. Since launch, the console has accrued some great examples of the genre, and the catalogue of great visual novels on Switch is growing all the time. Everyone loves a good book, right?

The Analogue Pocket is yet another highly-desirable device from the company behind the Super Nt and Mega Sg, and those who preordered one some time ago will finally be getting their hands on it this month - initial orders are shipping on Monday.
Analogue has now announced that, on Tuesday December 14th, the machine will once again be available to order.

                    <span>Switch GOTY 2021 incoming!
2021 has certainly been a tough year for many of us, but it&#x27;s been a surprisingly great one when it comes to quality video games. Much like at the beginning of 2020, Nintendo&#x27;s slate of upcoming games looked pretty empty back in January, but ongoing and often surprise announcements meant we ended up with a impressive lineup on Switch this year. We got a brand new 2D Metroid, for crying out loud — a real good&#x27;un, too!
With 2022 fast approaching, it&#x27;s time to rate all this year&#x27;s releases for our annual reader-ranked Game of the Year 2021!

                    <span>First time was before the delay.
Although we were meant to be playing Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp on the Switch by now, in October Nintendo announced a delay.
While it&#x27;s now due to arrive in &quot;Spring 2022&quot; according to Nintendo&#x27;s website (or possibly 8th April 2022, according to eShop listings), since the previous update we&#x27;ve heard nothing else. Fortunately, we&#x27;ve got a small little reminder that it&#x27;s still on track for release in the first half of next year.

Another week down as we roll towards the holidays. This week we&#x27;ve seen a bunch of games, a few performances, and even an award or two at The Game Awards. Elsewhere, Paper Mario came to the NSO Expansion Pack, some wag hacked Chris Pratt&#x27;s voice into Super Mario Bros., and we sadly said goodbye to the man who designed two of the most iconic video games consoles ever made
Now, though, it&#x27;s time to chill out and discuss our weekend gaming plans. A few members of the Nintendo Life team have done just that below, so feel free to give our entries a read and then join in with your own via our comment section. Enjoy!

                    <span>Genshin Impact was recognized as the Best Mobile Game at The Game Awards last night, which was good and correct. But what most viewers probably remember is the way that the announcer pronounced the game’s title. Instead of using the hard “g” sound, she pronounced it using the soft “g.” Rather than being mean-spirited…

                    <span>Rebellion has announced Sniper Elite 5 will be coming next year, bringing the series to France while staying within the timeframe of World War II. In it, you play as super sniper Karl Fairburne, who is on a mission to take out high-ranking officers and find out the secret to something called Project Kraken.

Karl&#x27;s adventures through the French cities and countrysides won&#x27;t be pleasant, and he&#x27;ll have to rely on more than his sharpshooting skills to stay alive. The debut trailer shows plenty of weaponry at Fairburne&#x27;s disposal, like automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and good old-fashioned knives. Returning is the gruesome x-ray effect on devastating neck stabs or pinpoint accurate sniper shots that cause the target&#x27;s internals to explode spectacularly. 
Last night, keen-eyed viewers of The Game Awards might have spotted Sniper Elite 5 on the list of upcoming day one Game Pass releases. The game is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2022.

                    <span>Scorn was one of the first games announced for the Xbox Series X/S, but we still don’t know a ton about it, and it vanished from the limelight for over a year. Developer Ebb Software has finally spoken up to remind us that Scorn is still very much happening – in fact, it’s arriving next October. 
A cryptic trailer revealed the release window but didn’t divulge any new plot or gameplay details. A new community post on the game’s Kickstarter page only offers a behind-the-scenes look at the game’s art direction.

Ebb CEO Ljubomi Peklar issued a statement on the game, saying: 
“We’re really pleased to be able to share more news on the game and its release date. Scorn has been a real work of passion for the entire studio. The atmosphere, the journey, and the experience, we want every moment in Scorn to elicit an emotional response and feeling. It is our hope that Scorn stays with players long after they reach its ending. We’re looking forward to sharing more news and updates with our community as we move closer to launch”
So far, we know that Scorn is a first-person shooter set within a labyrinthine world heavily inspired by the art of H.R. Giger. The pulsating walls and grotesque enemies send the appropriate shivers up our spines, and we’re glad to see the project still has a pulse. The last time we saw Scorn in action was in a 14-minute gameplay demo that you can watch here.
Scorn is launching to Xbox Series X/S and PC.</span>

Among the numerous announcements to come out of The Game Awards, The Matrix Awakens was one of the coolest as well as the most puzzling. Not quite a game, per see, this free interactive experience serves as a tech demo to showcase Unreal Engine 5&#x27;s horsepower using The Matrix universe as a backdrop. To say that it looks great is an understatement. We&#x27;re still trying to lift our jaws off the floor thanks to the life-like fidelity of Awakens&#x27; city. 
Awakens puts you in control of an original character, though you do get to hang with Neo and Trinity during an exciting on-rails car chase/shooting gallery that we&#x27;ll partially show off. You&#x27;ll also get a glimpse at how Awakens lets players tinker with development tools to alter the look and feel of its world. 
Join Alex Stadink, Marcus Stewart, and Andrew Reiner as they delve into The Matrix Awakens&#x27; stunning digital playground. Be sure to check out our round-up of all the big announcements from The Game Awards, as well as the full list of award winners.</span>

                    <span>Sony&#x27;s first-party efforts grew stronger today with the acquisition of Seattle-based developer, Valkyrie Entertainment. Since 2002, Valkyrie has worked on over 100 games, often serving the role of co-developer or content creator. In a tweet, Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said Valkyrie &quot;will be making invaluable contributions to key PlayStation Studios franchises.&quot;
Valkyrie has worked with Sony several times in the past, helping bring Infamous, God of War, and Twisted Metal to market. The developer will once again be working with Sony Santa Monica on God of War: Ragnarok. 
In a press release issued earlier today, a Sony spokesperson outlined the path forward. &quot;The day-to-day operations post-acquisition will continue to be run by Valkyrie Entertainment’s current management team. Terms of this transaction including the acquisition cost are not disclosed due to contractual commitments.&quot;
Along with the acquisition, Valkyrie has a big reason to celebrate, as it was one of the studios involved in helping create Halo Infinite, the fantastic sequel that we awarded a review of 9.25 out of 10. Other games that have Valkyrie&#x27;s touch are pictured in the image above.
Sony and Microsoft are in a bit of an arms race, snatching up developers over the last few years to broaden their respective first-party game development efforts.</span>

                    <span>Another regional form for Pokémon Legends: Arceus has been announced, and this time it&#x27;s a new version of Voltorb.
Typically a pure electric type, the Hisuian Voltorb is grass and electric, joining Rotom Mow as the only two Pokémon that share the two elements. Like its gen-1 predecessor, Hisuian Voltorb still resembles a Pokéball, only now, instead of looking metallic and grumpy, this sphere has angular, joyful eyes and wood grain throughout its lower half. The design is somewhat closer to the Pokéballs you&#x27;ll find or craft while playing Legends: Arceus. It has a mysterious opening on the top of its head, which the Pokémon website says spouts seeds, though &quot;it’s impossible to see anything even if one peers into the hole.​&quot; When this Voltorb gets excited or feels like it&#x27;s in danger, that same hole is the source of discharged electricity.

Along with the announcement of Hisuian Voltorb, The Pokémon Company has released an adorable stop-motion animated short featuring the two-toned orb cheerfully irritating a Pikachu, Spheal, and Buneary. The video ends with a &quot;to be continued,&quot; so hopefully, we&#x27;ll learn more about Voltorb or its potential Hisuian Electrode evolution in the next one. With so many types of Pokéballs out there, with various designs and colors, I&#x27;d love to see a bunch of variations of Voltorb to match the look of a Quick Ball or a Nest Ball.
Pokémon Legends: Arceus is a semi-open world adventure where players step back in time to explore the Hisui region, which we now know as Sinnoh from Diamond and Pearl. Trainers take a more active role in battle and catching wild Pokémon, bringing the concept of the franchise a little further from its purely turn-based roots. Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches for Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022.</span>

                    <span>2019’s Bury Me, My Love offered one of the most uniquely told narratives in recent memory (not to mention being quite emotional). We’ve been curious as to what developer The Pixel Hunt had up its sleeve next, and we found out yesterday with the reveal of its next project, The Wreck.
The Wreck is billed as a mature 3D visual novel. It stars a failed screenwriter named Junon who must relive one of the most important and, if the trailer is any indication, traumatizing days of her life. The Pixel Hunt describes the story as a tale about “sisterhood, motherhood, grief, and survival.”

In terms of gameplay, you’ll converse with a small cast of characters to explore Junon’s past in a non-linear story. With Junon dealing with emotional stress and her mother in critical condition, revisiting and coming to terms with a challenging past and present sounds easier said than done. Though the trailer establishes the tone,  the gallery of screenshots below provides a better idea of how moment-to-moment gameplay appears and the game&#x27;s dream-like quality.

                    <span>The Nintendo 64 library of the Switch Online Expansion Pack gets a dose of Rare next month when Banjo-Kazooie joins the service.
The game joins the service sometime in January, but there&#x27;s no exact date as of yet. The 1998 platformer is widely remembered as a standout game for the N64 (especially for third-party games) and among the most beloved games of the era overall. While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn’t been universally loved, it’s cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection.

Beneath exhilarating rollercoaster rides and silly conversations with squirrels, It Takes Two has a heavy heart. It’s about divorce and the toll taken on a daughter who doesn’t want to lose her family. It’s about decaying love and the differences that divide us. It’s about not wanting to face reality and not wanting to let go. It’s also about hope and uncertainty, the past creating a better future, and finding common ground no matter how much it may hurt. All of these elements are beautifully woven into a colorful and soulful adventure that hits hard, both in its moving narrative an…</span>

                    <span>Arkane Studios has built a strong cult following over the last decade. Its expertise is developing immersive sims – games that facilitate unpredictable stories and emergent gameplay through player choice, complex AI, persistent systems, and sandbox level design. Like the best immersive sims, Deathloop encourages you to use its robust suite of tools to poke at its many systems and environments to differing results, which then allows you to piece together the best route through any place. However, unlike its predecessors Dishonored and Prey, Deathloop doesn’t have one specific mission, ability, or weapon that stands out as the best part of the adventure. Instead, it showcases how a game’s many elements can interact with one another to create a truly unique experience.
Specifically, the game’s level design and time of day system work together to create a setting that invites exploration and houses adaptive characters to provide consequences to player actions. Add in a consistent ruleset and shared design language that permeates every aspect of Deathloop, and you’ll understand why the title is one of the best releases of 2021.
There isn’t one particular thread greater than the rest. Deathloop is an impressive intersection of stories and gameplay systems woven together to create a tapestry deserving of your attention. In my latest video essay, I break down the game design behind Deathloop in an attempt to better understand one of the best games on PlayStation 5 and my personal favorite game of 2021:

While there aren&#x27;t any ring-like space mechanisms the games are named for, the initial peek at Halo The Series gave us plenty to be excited about. It features plenty of Spartans, interstellar asteroid civilizations, and most importantly, Master Chief doing a cool, heroic landing and pose in the sand. 
Dr. Halsey narrates the piece, likely speaking to John-117 about how she&#x27;s counting on him to be special and he gives people hope. We get some beautiful shots of human cities, Chief exploring some stony ruins, and what looks to be a brilliantly-lit alien structure. The Covenant is said to play a large role as an antagonist in the series, though we don&#x27;t catch a glimpse of the coalition of extraterrestrial races quite yet.

Halo The Series is produced in coordination with Showtime, Amblin Television, and 343 Industries. It stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117,  Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066, and Jen Taylor reprising her role as the AI Cortana. The show hits Paramount+ sometime in 2022.

Arc Raiders is an upcoming free-to-play cooperative shooter by Embark Studios, which is comprised of previous DICE employees who worked on the Battlefield series. Embark took to The Game Awards to unveil its project, Arc Raiders, offering our first big look at the game in action.
With Robyn&#x27;s &quot;Dancing On My Own&quot; serving as the trailer&#x27;s anthem, we were introduced to deadly mechanized threats coming from space that must be brought down with the cooperation of your squad. Plenty of gunfire and explosions naturally ensue. But then the trailer shows humongous mechanized beings that take up the entire screen, giving the fights a David versus Goliath feel. You are playing as the underdog and must work together with your team to shoot off enemy parts and make sure everyone stays alive. In one cool scene, a character launches toward the giant being and chucks a grenade right at its center. The trailer ends by saying: &quot;They will never stop coming,&quot; and shows an armored baddie with red eyes rising. You can watch it for yourself above.
The game&#x27;s description on Steam says players will wield tools and gadgets to outsmart the enemy and use physics to their advantage for success. 
Arc Raiders is set to come out in 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                    <span>Previous trailers and tons of footage from the closed Network Test have given players a decent amount of information to pick apart and sort through regarding the upcoming From Software action-RPG Elden Ring. Today at The Game Awards 2021, we were treated to yet another taste of what&#x27;s to come. Suppose you&#x27;re looking for more information on Elden Ring. In that case, you might want to check out an extensive write-up of everything we discovered in hours and hours of wandering around the Network Test – or join us on video for some hot and spicy commentary. Today, players got a little more context about the world that From Software and G.R.R. Martin have created for Elden Ring. Check out the entire trailer below.

The trailer details the downfall of the demigods, with some style and flair. Wars raged between the demigods, with a grand battle between two champions. A mysterious character narrates the whole thing, and all it does is raise more questions. Well, hopefully, we&#x27;ll have some answers – and can start exploring – soon enough.
What do you think this means for Elden Ring? After Bloodborne&#x27;s mid-game surprise shift, I think everyone&#x27;s anticipating that there are plenty of exciting secrets in store. These games are often better experienced without a full spoiler suite. Still, it&#x27;s likely that any big revelations and surprises will be saved for post-launch as we continue to see parts and pieces stitched together from the early-game experience. What did you think of the trailer? Let us know in the comments! Elden Ring is slated to land on February 25, 2022 on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</span>

                    <span>The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal 5 Experience has officially been revealed and it’s available to experience on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S right now. 
Revealed during The Game Awards 2021 by none other than Keanu Reeves, who plays Neo in the Matrix franchise, and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinity, this experience is a visual showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 is capable of. During The Game Awards 2021, Reeves and Moss were found in front of the iconic dodge-a-bullet-by-bending-really-far-backwards-scene from the first Matrix movie.

Reeves jokes that he can’t pull off moves like that anymore, but he says in Unreal Engine 5, he can. Then, we see some footage from Matrix Resurrections, which oddly enough features footage from The Matrix, too. From there, we returned to Reeves and Moss, who ask, “what is a game and what is a movie?”
Following this, the duo revealed the world premiere of The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience and it was quite impressive, if not a touch veering into uncanny valley territory.

It turns out that this experience is playable and seems to take place during a scene in which Neo and Trinity are dodging enemies while racing down a street. We haven’t played it yet, but if we had to guess, it plays like a shooter of sorts. It appears to be a tech demo with playable elements.

                    <span>Planet of Lana, the debut project from developer Wishfully Studio received a new trailer tonight at The Game Awards. 
One of the most notable things about the game&#x27;s appearance at tonight&#x27;s show was the announcement of its composer: Takeshi Furukawa, the BAFTA Award-winning composer for The Last Guardian. We got a taste of his music as it played over the game&#x27;s trailer, which shows a character riding atop some kind of robotic horse throughout a desert. As this happens, the character is chased by a group of rocket-powered, spider-like creates. The trailer ends with the character thrown from their horse, as small, cat-like creature paws at them.
Check out the trailer below.

Planet of Lana is expected to be released in 2022 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

                    <span>We’ve known about the co-op horror FPS called GTFO for a long time now, and the game has been in Early Access for exactly two years. For the game’s second anniversary of play, 10 Chambers Collective has released the full launch version.
GTFO follows a group of prisoners who are sent down into a dangerous crater by a mysterious individual named the Warden, there to scavenge for supplies and weapons and complete a variety of tasks. The action focuses on four-player teamwork, where you must balance stealth and more active combat situations to survive and escape. The game has won praise in its early access phase for its tense action and scary moments.
The game is now available to play in full on PC, and you can watch the gameplay trailer below.

                    <span>Techland&#x27;s Dying Light 2 Stay Human got a new trailer during The Game Awards, showcasing some of the grim realities of the harsh world coming next February. Not only does the trailer serve up an impressive visual showcase, but it also highlights one of the most significant conflicts that can happen in the myriad hypothetical zombie apocalypse scenarios, where humans are at each other&#x27;s throats as one of the most dangerous threats of all. It&#x27;s almost like one of the challenges in these survival scenarios is to stay human despite society and the world crumbling into chaos. Oh wait, they put that in the title just in case we forgot. Nice! Anyway, check out this cool trailer that explores some pretty gruesome and grim stuff. Zombies are scary, and tough choices will be made in this game for sure.

Dying Light 2 Stay Human is scheduled to land on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 4, 2022.</span>

                    <span>A Plague Tale: Requiem, sequel to 2019&#x27;s A Plague Tale: Innocence, made its unexpected debut during E3 back in June. That moment came by way of a cinematic trailer, but tonight&#x27;s Game Awards provided a first look at gameplay. To the surprise of no one who played the original, there are rats. Lots and lots of rats. 
Amicia and Hugo are off on another dark quest and the biggest difference is that Amicia gets her hands a lot dirtier this time around. She&#x27;s gone from wielding just a slingshot and hiding in the shadows to firing crossbows in what looks to be more involved combat. Of course, the supernatural rat plague remains the star and the swarm look deadlier (and more visually impressive) than ever.

A Plague Tale: Requiem launches to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2022. It&#x27;s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass.</span>

Rocksteady debuted the first gameplay trailer for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League at The Game Awards. In it, we get to see how the unlikely team of villains gets around Metropolis and the ways they deal with Brainiac&#x27;s hordes of mind-controlled soldiers and other eldrich-looking monstrosities. 
However, the footage didn&#x27;t go off as planned. Debra Wilson&#x27;s Amanda Waller hacked into the production and appeared on stage to lecture host Geoff Keighley about releasing classified information. She still let us see the game despite the threats. I&#x27;m not sure why; I&#x27;m not a security expert.
We got a great look at the Squad&#x27;s mobility and combat capabilities in the extended trailer. Harley Quinn grapples to what looks like bat-drones to swing around the ai…</span>

                    <span>Iron Galaxy Studios has announced Rumbleverse, a new colorful free-to-play brawler with 40-player online multiplayer. 
Announced during The Game Awards 2021, the Rumbleverse debut trailer showcases some of the fun and zany characters we’ll be playing as in the new brawler. It seems quite expansive too. Fighters in the trailer jump all around a city, scaling buildings and more. According to a press release about the game, players will use an “ever-changing arsenal of elbow drops, powerbombs, and dropkicks” to defeat others.

You’ll be able to customize your brawler, of course, as each has 14 points of customization.
While what we saw in the trailer looked great, it was purely cinematics. However, TGA host Geoff Keighley revealed that Rumbleverse will have a special gameplay event tomorrow, and it sounds like we’ll be seeing actual gameplay then. This first look is tomorrow, December 10, from 12 p.m. EST to 6 p.m. EST. 
Based on a title screen at the end of the trailer, Rumbleverse is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via the Epic Games Store. There’s no mention of Steam, so it seems if you want to play Rumbleverse on PC, you’ll need to do so through the Epic Games Store. 
“Welcome to Grapital City,” a description of Rumbleverse reads on the game’s official website. “This city was built to celebrate the glorious traditions of melee combat – and you’re invited. Create a unique champion. Get shot out of a cannon. Smash crates to find upgrades. Pick a fight and battle to the last.”

                    <span>In one of The Game Awards&#x27; shortest reveals of the night, developer Innersloth announced the wildly popular Among Us is heading to VR. That&#x27;s right; you&#x27;ll be able to voluntarily strap yourself into a simulated crewmate helmet and attempt to survive while a murderous imposter roams your ship. Or, you could be the one stabbing your friends in the back as they go about trying to swipe that key card just right. 
The trailer only showed a glimpse of the VR game&#x27;s new look, but the 3D reimagining doesn&#x27;t seem to deviate too wildly from Among Us&#x27; simplistic design. The footage shows us what it will look like to stand in the Skeld, scanning around suspiciously at the several vents strewn about the room while trying to punch in a series of numbers in the keypad before us. Everything seems fine...until it isn&#x27;t and the screen goes blank. Among Us VR seems like a fertile ground for jump scares. 
The team did not share more about the title in the trailer, but Innersloth&#x27;s website gave us a little more to go on:
really have an emergency meeting together. (Note: VR version won&#x27;t be compatible with the original Among Us game, so you&#x27;ll only be able to play against other VR beans.)

Platforms, release dates, and additional information around Among Us VR will be announced at a later date. To stay updated, you can follow our new Among Us VR Twitter account or keep an eye on our site right here.</span>

                    <span>We got our first look at Dune: Spice Wars this evening, and the game is clearly looking to follow-up on a long-established claim of success in the strategy genre.
The new trailer is mostly atmospheric, and we hear a lot of place and character names that firmly entrench the new game in the Dune fiction. As the camera pans out from a scene on Arrakis, we see a giant hand holding a portion of the planet, sand slipping from its fingers.
The game’s official site has more detail to offer, promising that Dune: Spice Wars is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements. The game is being developed by Shiro Games, the team behind the survival game called Northgard.
In the new Spice Wars game, players take charge of a faction vying for control of Arakkis, the only place in the universe where Spice can be found, a substance that can expand consciousness and allow for space travel across vast distances. Of course, players can take control of familiar factions like Atreides and Harkonnen, but it sounds like other factions are an option as well. The game is also promising a variety of mechanics and ways to aim for victory, including subterfuge, politics, growth of economy, or straight-up warfare. The game boasts 4X dynamics in real-time, as players will explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate while they seek control of the vast desert planet.
Dune: Spice Wars is coming to early access first to help further development of the project, and the first chance to try the game is on the way in 2022.
Dune is experiencing a particularly potent resurgence at the moment thanks to the new and successful film, and this first glimpse of the new game looks promising.

Forspoken is an upcoming action/role-playing game from Square Enix&#x27;s Luminous Productions, and it has some top-tier talent behind it. The game&#x27;s writing team includes Gary Whitta, Amy Hennig, Allison Rymer, and Todd Stashwick, to name a few. But we still haven&#x27;t seen much about the game, which centers on a young woman named Frey who gets transported from New York City to a fantastical world. A new trailer shown at The Game Awards tonight changed that, introducing us to one of Frey&#x27;s adversaries, played by Pollyanna McIntosh (The Walking Dead). 
In the trailer, Frey begs to go home and says she doesn&#x27;t know how she got to this strange world. But it looks like she&#x27;s not exactly having a great time, as she has to contend with fire-breathing dragons and other animal and human threats attacking her. And she&#x27;s pretty much getting blamed for everything, with people saying she trespassed on the land and set this battle into motion. Thankfully, she has some cool magic at her disposal, and what looks like a hoverboard to get around with ease. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action. 
Forspoken launches on May 24 for PS5 and PC. The game is said to leverage the graphical capabilities of Sony&#x27;s new system, with ray tracing and procedural generation.</span>

This year’s Game Awards has been full of great announcements and reveals, but if you’re a Trekkie, you might be most interested in Dramatic Labs’ reveal of a new adventure game that lets players explore a distant corner of the galaxy aboard one of Starfleet’s news ships, the U.S.S. Resolute. 
Star Trek: Resurgence is billed as a third-person choice-driven adventure game centering on two new characters, first officer Jara Rydek and engineer Carter Diaz. Set shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Resurgence follows the crew of the Resolute as they unravel a sinister mystery between two alien civilizations that threatens to erupt into all-out war. While Resurgence is a wholly original story, Dramatic Labs also teased the fans might recognize a familiar face or two along the way. 
It’s worth noting that Dramatic Labs is composed of people with experience in the adventure space, as the team is comprised of veterans from Telltale Games, and many of Dramatic Labs’ devs worked on games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones, and Batman. 
“As fans of Star Trek, it’s truly an honor to be crafting a story which puts players right in the heart of the action, where significant choices and decisions will affect the entire narrative,” said Dramatic Labs founder Kevin Bruner. “Built from the ground up using Epic’s Unreal engine and our proprietary narrative engine, this game showcases our team’s evolution in creating thought-provoking story-rich adventures.”
Star Trek: Resurgence is scheduled for release next Spring for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive.</span>

                    <span>We got a new look at Horizon Forbidden West during the Game Awards, and while the trailer was brief, it packed in a lot of new footage including newly-revealed machines and outfits.
The montage-style video shows off pterodactyl and plesiosaur-like creatures, further emphasizing the prehistoric theme established by the raptor-like Clawstriders and mammoth-inspired Tremortusks from previous showings. We also catch glimpses of massive armadillo-like machines that roll into balls to hurl themselves at Aloy and even a giant, menacing cobra. Aloy showcases some of the outfits she’ll wear, including some intimidating war paint and a striking red bodysuit.

Horizon Forbidden West continues to make us salivate as we march towards its February 18 launch. You can pick it up on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, and learn more about its new systems by watching our video interview with its principal designers.</span>

                    <span>Gearbox debuted a new look at Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands with a trailer at The Game Awards focusing on the fantasy looter shooter’s story and characters.
Will Arnett’s voice as The Dragon Lord opens the trailer, where a tome titled Bunkers &amp; Badasses sprawls open, introducing the player’s role of The Fatemaker. This moniker explains itself pretty well! Soon after, we meet Valentine (Andy Samberg), one of the characters in your B&amp;B campaign, who also introduces his “scary, stabby” friend, a robot named Frette.

A press release from Gearbox breaks down some of the characters we see in the trailer and will meet during our time with Tiny Tina (Ashly Burch). Valentine likens himself to a dashing rogue, while others pin him as a “washed-up, low-rent space pirate.” Also joining the playgroup is Frette, a former accounting bot who found herself traveling with Valentine after a “chance encounter” that resulted in her former employer “filing for Bankruptcy While Currently On Fire,” which is said to be legally different from regular bankruptcy.
Rounding out the team is Torgue, the famed Borderlands weapons manufacturer with a persona not unlike a professional wrestler. You can see him in the trailer jamming on a very complex-looking guitar, filling the role of the bard in Tina’s tabletop RPG. Speaking of which, Wonderlands has players moving around a tabletop overworld where fourth-wall-breaking objects like cheese puffs and bottlecap bridges enhance the sense of these characters sitting around a table, playing Bunkers &amp; Badasses.
Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands launches on March 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Epic Games Store will be the exclusive home for the PC version at launch, with other PC marketplaces receiving the game later in 2022.

                    <span>At The Game Awards 2021, we got a nice, new look at the upcoming exploration game Tchia. The game is inspired by New Caledonia, a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean, and has you engaging in all kinds of exploration activities like swimming, gliding, sailing, climbing, and more. You get to interact with island inhabitants, play music, customize your boat, and even take control of a wide range of animals. That&#x27;s right, you can soul jump around to actually become animals.
Get creative with it by swimming around hard-to-traverse water as a fish, or dig up some fun stuff as a dog. Many interesting tools can be used to help complete your tasks, including a compass, camera, and flashlight. A vast range of cosmetics for your character can also be unlocked. There are definitely some extremely chill vibes going around as you take in the wonderful sea air and interact with an enchanting environment. You can check out the tropical tranquility right here in the trailer!

So how about a release date? A screen from the new trailer indicates that the game is launching in Spring 2022 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Epic Games Store on PC.</span>

                    <span>Tonight during The Game Awards, Deep Silver Volition showed off a new trailer for its upcoming Saints Row reboot. There wasn&#x27;t any news in the trailer that people didn&#x27;t already know – especially if they read Game Informer&#x27;s cover story a few months back – but it was a new look, regardless. 
In the trailer, we see a variety of the game&#x27;s different gangs, looks at the story, and its open-world mayhem – including, but not limited to, a helicopter swinging a car around like a wrecking ball, tanks wrecking shop, men getting kicked in the groin, and lots and lots of explosions. It&#x27;s like 2012 all over again. 
Check out the trailer below.

Saints Row will be released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 23, 2022.</span>

                    <span>Jumpship, the development studio working on Somerville, was formed in 2017, and it has some big names behind it. According to The Game Awards host, Geoff Keighley, two years later, in 2019, one developer shared his dream of seeing the studio&#x27;s debut project on the show&#x27;s big stage. That was a wish Keighley seemed happy to grant at tonight&#x27;s ceremony as he introduced a new trailer for Somerville.
Tense and enigmatic, the trailer flashes from creepy, abandoned toy stores to scenes showcasing speeding spacecraft. It doesn&#x27;t reveal a lot about what fans can expect from the moment-to-moment gameplay, and doesn&#x27;t unveil a definitive release date, but it does show off the game&#x27;s fantastic aesthetic and nail-biting tone.

Though the footage got The Game Awards&#x27; signature &quot;World Premiere&quot; treatment, this is actually the most recent of several looks we&#x27;ve had at Somerville. Earlier this summer, Jumpship&#x27;s title got the spotlight during Microsoft&#x27;s E3 event. The trailer was equally enigmatic, though it introduced the idea that the game would follow a once-quiet world visited by hostile, extraterrestrial entities. Hopefully, we will see more of the game, and get a release date, soon.</span>

Mark June 30, 2022 as the day you&#x27;ll control new playable character Ms. Chalice to tackle a new island filled with wacky new bosses. These foes are sure to be a challenge (this is Cuphead, after all), so thankfully you&#x27;ll be outfitted with weapons and magical charms. Check it out in the trailer below:

                    <span>Tonight’s Game Awards revealed that Sonic Frontiers is the official title for the next 3D Sonic game, and the hedgehog is expanding his horizons to a bigger world than ever. 
Frontiers is an open-world game – or open-zone as Sega describes it – developed by Sonic Team Japan and led by Sonic Forces/Sonic Lost World director, Morio Kishimoto. Sonic embarks on an adventure to the Starfall Islands, a collection of forests, deserts, waterfalls, among other biomes. It&#x27;s unsure what to expect, but based on the trailer, Sonic has some titanic opposition standing in his way. Fans of the Sonic comic books should be happy to know that Ian Flynn, head writer of IDW&#x27;s current Sonic the Hedgehog comic and former lead writer of the Archie Comics Sonic series, is penning Frontier&#x27;s narrative.

Sonic Frontiers doesn’t have an exact release date, but it’s coming during the 2022 holiday season for current and last-gen consoles. It’s cool to see Sonic tackling a true open-world for the first time. Hopefully, it borrows some tips from another high-speed 3D platformer, Solar Ash.

Telltale has announced The Expanse: A Telltale Series and it’s co-developing the game with Deck Nine, the studio behind this year’s Life Is Strange: True Colors. 
Revealed during The Game Awards 2021 by way of a debut trailer, The Expanse is a prequel to the Amazon TV series of the same name (which itself is based on The Expanse novella series) and it will feature Camina Drummer as the main protagonist. Drummer, heavily featured throughout Amazon’s show, is the leader of a ragtag scavenging crew in the game and players must explore the outer belt while making tough decisions that will decide the fate of her crew and more.

Nightingale, a Victorian shared-world survival crafting game from ex-BioWare developers including ex-BioWare general manager Aaryn Flynn, has been announced. 
Flynn announced that he was building a new studio for Improbable back in 2019 and until today, it remained simply an internal Improbable studio in Edmonton, Canada. Flynn and the team announced during The Game Awards 2021 tonight that the studio is officially Inflexion Games and its first game is Nightingale. 
Set in a Victorian “gaslamp” fantasy setting, Nightingale will task players with exploring worlds in search of the rumored last haven of humanity called…you guessed it: Nightingale. It’s currently in development and slated for an Early Access release on PC sometime next year. 
Players can expect forests, swamps, deserts, and more in the lands of the Fae to explore. Along the way, they’ll need to construct estates, farms, communities, and more to survive using crafted tools, gear, and weapons. You’ll be able to do all of this alongside friends and foes alike, thanks to the shared world aspect of Nightingale.

                    <span>This evening’s Game Awards presentation brought a new look at Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. We’ve known for some months that the new expansion was going to change up the status quo of power in the Destiny universe. Specifically, the Hive goddess named Savathûn seems to have found a way to grant Guardian-like powers to her Hive soldiers. Of greatest significance, that means that the Hive foes you defeat can come back from death after you take them down.
That was the focus of the new video that debuted tonight, comprised of in-game footage that shows off a fireteam confronting a Hive Knight Guardian, accompanied by a live-action debrief between one of the human Guardians who was present and Ikora Rey, in her role as a leader of the Vanguard. The fireteam seems to destroy the Hive Knight, but then it comes back from death. The combat must eventually turn out to the better, as the returning fireteam member has the remains of the Hive Ghost, but it’s clear that things did not go well on the mission.
After the trailer, we also learned that the footage shown was from the opening mission of the new expansion.
Destiny 2: The Witch Queen is set to release across all platforms on February 22. It’s been a long wait for a major new expansion, but the scope and drama of Savathûn’s big coming-out party has us excited.

                    <span>Bokeh Game Studio, the new independent development house headed up by Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama, finally unveiled its debut project, Slitterhead, tonight at The Game Awards. Predictably, it&#x27;s grotesque. 
The trailer opens with a man walking down a typical city alley before running into a woman. Shortly thereafter, we get our first glimpse at what is ostensibly a Slitterhead, as the woman&#x27;s face tears open and her body mutates into a skeletal monstrosity. From there, a bizarre compilation of scenes plays, including, but not limited to, police being chopped in half by similar skeletal beasts, a man in a motorcycle helmet conjuring blood into a sword, another man in his pajamas falling through the sky, and more. We end on a shot of a densely-packed apartment complex as a plane flies closely overhead, before zooming in on an older woman whose face has torn open – much like the others – though this time it shuts, leaving the woman looking normal.

Aside from what we saw in the trailer, we don&#x27;t know too much about Slitterhead, other than what Toyama&#x27;s hinted at in past interviews. Back in June, it was revealed he was working on a choice-driven game. In December 2020, Toyama told IGN Japan his next project (ostensibly this one) would be released in 2023.</span>

Wonder Woman is finally getting her own game, and we didn&#x27;t see this one coming. Today at The Game Awards, Warner Bros. Games announced the project with a small teaser that confirmed Monolith, best known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, would be acting as the developer. 
The trailer, which you can watch above, didn&#x27;t give us much information, but it did begin with Diana&#x27;s mother, Hippolyta, calling Diana home, saying a threat comes to their shores. It looks like Wonder Woman will have a big weight on her shoulders as she&#x27;ll have to restore what&#x27;s been broken and make allies. &quot;You are a hero, but you can be more,&quot; her mother says. Wonder Woman&#x27;s shiny red, blue, and gold armor flashes with the iconic W,  and we then see her lasso in all its glory.
The trailer ends by saying: &quot;You can be a leader,&quot; which makes us curious how Monolith will challenge us with that task, especially since the brief description spoke about uniting old enemies and forging new bonds. Monolith is the studio that brought us the famous nemesis system, after all, so we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it had some clever ideas for Woman Woman.
The trailer&#x27;s Youtube description shed a little more light, saying Wonder Woman is an open-world action-adventure game where she&#x27;ll have to unite two worlds.  It&#x27;s also confirmed to be a single-player game, with an original story set in the DC Universe. The description also said the game is powered by the nemesis system, so at the very least, we can count on that to enhance the experience.
No platforms were verified at this time, but we&#x27;ll update the story when they&#x27;re revealed.</span>

                    <span>Announced during The Game Awards 2021, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will finally hit PC on December 16, more than a year after the game’s original release and months after it launched on PS5. However, it appears Intergrade will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, or at least, a non-EGS version has not been detailed.

The trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2021 began with an Epic Games Store logo, and the closing screen that appeared at the end of the trailer had no mention of Steam. So, if you want to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC next week, you’ll have to buy it on the Epic Games Store for now. 
As a reminder, Intergrade includes the Intermission story episode. That means you’ll be able to play as Yuffie and infiltrate a Shinra facility as the famed ninja on PC. You’ll also get to play as Cloud, Aerith, and more through the base story of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which happens to be great. You can read about why in Game Informer’s Final Fantasy 7 Remake review. Read about how the sequel to Remake will be quite different after that. 
Are you going to be checking out Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC next week? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>As promised, tonight&#x27;s Game Awards gave us the first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The live-action/animated film sees the return of Sonic (Ben Schwartz), Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) along with newcomers Knuckles (Idris Elba) and Tails (Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey) in an adventure that looks as zany as the previous film. 
Robotnik is back (with a spiffy new jacket) and has recruited Knuckles to help even the score against Sonic. Thankfully, the blue blur is backed by his human cop buddy Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) and one Miles Prower. That&#x27;s Tails for you non-Sonic nerds. Take a look at the fun trailer below.

                    <span>Today is bringing plenty of reveals at The Game Awards. One of the more intriguing is the long-awaited reveal of Alan Wake II. Rumored in one form or another for years, the new game promises to finally give us some answers about the enigmatic writer and his adventures – or maybe just more questions.
In the trailer, we hear narration from a mysterious voice, talking about expectations for a story, but the realization that sometimes a story isn’t what you expect or want it to be. As the camera zooms in on a single figure in a desolate town, we hear the phrase: “This story is a monster, and monsters wear many faces.”
The new trailer finally gave us a first look at Alan Wake II, including a release date of 2023. Remedy’s creative director, Sam Lake, was on site at The Game Awards to announce that this sequel is actually a survival/horror game, moving away from its action roots.
Unfortunately, Remedy’s Lake also revealed that we likely won’t learn anything else about the game until summer of 2022. We did learn, however, that Remedy’s Alan Wake II is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and the Epic Games Store.

This year&#x27;s trailer has all of the above, plus more of the animal and object possession and the ways you can use it in combat. Lovely stuff. Watch it below.

                    <span>My mates and I are doing the dishes, discussing whether we’ll see the region of Noxus feature more prominently in the next season of Arcane, an animated series based on League Of Legends. In the air: soap bubbles and excitement. One of my friends asks me whether Jinx is like that in-game. “It’s been a while, but I think so, yeah”, I reply.
I’m in the car on the way to badminton and I’m listening to the song Dynasties &amp; Dystopia from Arcane, the show based on League Of Legends. In the air: hip-hop and a bobbing head. Something significant has happened here. All of a sudden, I am obsessed with a game I shelved years ago, and yet I have no desire to go back. Is this next-gen? More than that, probably.

                    <span>While not as flashy as a new 4K monitor or one of the best graphics cards, an SSD can make a surprisingly big difference to your PC gaming experience. Storing their data in semiconductor cells rather than old-timey spinning plates, SSDs have considerably faster transfer speeds than traditional hard disks, and so can slash loading times right down. This also makes them generally more expensive, although prices are coming down all the time, this guide to the best SSD deals right now could help you find a particularly good bargain.

                    <span>I was wary of the possibility that White Shadows would be one of those platformers. You know the ones. The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.


With its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can&#x27;t really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.

Still, last night at The Game Awards we all got a first look at Star Wars Eclipse in the form of a cinematic trailer. And let&#x27;s be honest: that trailer is cracking. It&#x27;s really good. And it&#x27;s so good that I think we all need to remember that there is absolutely no way QD aren&#x27;t going to spectacularly boot this.

                    <span>Needs must, gentle friends, needs must, and in particular I need to once more head into the dank and dreary evidence basement of the RPS treehouse. Here, at the behest of our very kind supporters, I must navigate a strange maze of specimen tanks, suggestions of whiskers, tentacles and odd wings occasionally stirring behind the glass as I pass. Eventually I will reach a row of grey filing cabinets, locate the right drawer, and tug it open, the scream of rusted metal echoing through the dark room.
I will spend some time rifling through the papers within, growing more and more frantic as I hear the slow tread of heavy footsteps approaching. I must find the right file, but also I must escape in time! I haven&#x27;t been caught yet. Today I escaped with the fifth episode of The Nate Files supporters-only podcast. It&#x27;s about speculative biology. Oh no.

                    <span>Every so often, Matthew and I will be browsing BBC iPlayer in our never-ending search for something to watch and we&#x27;ll get served up some clips from the Live From The BBC comedy series. It&#x27;s a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. 
He&#x27;s one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There&#x27;s plenty of that nonsense in Ewins&#x27; set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a motorist in south west England, chances are you&#x27;ve probably encountered (or at least heard of) Swindon&#x27;s Magic Roundabout. It&#x27;s a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I&#x27;m not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London&#x27;s equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham&#x27;s Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. 
It&#x27;s the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you&#x27;ll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there&#x27;s one challenge that&#x27;s truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts.

                    <span>About five hours into Icarus, the new survival game from Day Z’s Dean Hall and co, I had a moment. I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. 


That’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.

The low admission fee of zero pounds was announced at The Game Awards, which is a pretty good deal if you’re looking to participate in a battle royale that’s still very much alive and kicking. Players can also pay for Battlegrounds Plus, an account upgrade that’ll net you some extra in-game unlocks. And don&#x27;t worry, if you already own the game you&#x27;ll get that upgrade for free.

As announced during The Game Awards last night, we can expect it to arrive on March 16th, 2022.
We&#x27;ve been hearing about Tunic for literal years now, and its omnipresence at showcases and announceathons like The Game Awards has kept it on everyone&#x27;s radar the whole time. Feast your eyes on what will hopefully be one of the last trailers for it, until the happy day we post about a launch trailer.

If my mind were any kind of structure it would be a Lego creative box of randomly mixed bricks. Thus, like an advanced robot, I store my memory outside my body in the form of daily to-do lists that I write up every morning. Wytchwood is a to-do list game, with each item cascading into a sub-list of more things to be ticked off. The difference is, in real life, my daily to-do list only includes &#x27;make shiny lure to catch an elf and steal its shoes&#x27; on Tuesdays.

                    <span>Remember Saints Row? It&#x27;s back, in trailer form. After Volition&#x27;s reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night&#x27;s Game Awards.
The trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it&#x27;s technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game. Check out the trailer below to agree with me.

                    <span>Shortly after Telltale Games announced a game based on The Expanse at The Game Awards tonight, a group of former Telltale employees announced they too were boldly going into an interactive sci-fi story based on a TV show. New studio Dramatic Labs announced Star Trek: Resurgence, a Telltale-style game about choosing your own adventure in the world of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo. It looks hella Telltale, and they even have the digital corpse of Leonard Nimoy. But man, the Star Trek story I crave would be about downtime, not action.

                    <span>Here he comes, that speedy blue boy. Where will he go? Who knows! He can run around in an open world now, no longer restrained by specific paths which cause him to inexplicably die when he steps a toe off of them. I am, of course, talking about the newly announced Sonic Frontiers. The next 3D Sonic game is set to arrive late 2022, and we got our first glimpse of it at The Game Awards tonight.

                    <span>Forspoken, a game whose name I will never pronounce correctly but was once known as Project Athia, finally has a concrete release date. Announced tonight at The Game Awards, Square Enix&#x27;s big action RPG adventure will be hitting PC on May 24th 2022. I guess that technically still counts as &#x27;spring&#x27; and therefore doesn&#x27;t constitute a delay on its previous launch window, but it sure is a lot closer to summer than I was expecting. In any case, there&#x27;s a shiny new trailer with some very hammy villains to enjoy at the same time.

                    <span>Honestly, I&#x27;ve no interest in Wonder Woman. Warner Bros announcing an open-world Wonder Woman game at The Game Awards tonight meant nothing to me at first. My interest was piqued when I saw it&#x27;s being made by Monolith, the studio behind F.E.A.R. and the Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor series. Then I saw OH WAIT it&#x27;s using that wonderful patented Nemesis System which breathes personality and history into enemies? I&#x27;m in. Fully. Let&#x27;s go.

                    <span>I almost missed the trailer for Arc Raiders during The Game Awards, but quickly found the tab it was playing in as soon as I heard Robyn&#x27;s Dancing On My Own. What a fab tune for a game trailer! Arc Raiders looks alright - it&#x27;s a free-to-play third-person shooter in which you and a squad of mates fight evil robots, and it&#x27;s coming out in 2022. Check out the vid below (if only to listen to a proper bop).

                    <span>It&#x27;s been three years since Babylon&#x27;s Fall was first announced, but PlatinumGames&#x27; co-op hack and slasher finally has a release date. It&#x27;s out on March 3rd 2022, and its new Game Awards trailer certainly shows a much more vivid and eye-catching game than the one Ed and I saw in the most recent closed beta. Not only are there giant skull bosses with lasers bursting out of their eye sockets, but some of the creatures you&#x27;ll face in the Tower Of Babylon look suspiciously like Nier: Automata-style bullet-hell boys. See it all in action below.

Revealed during The Game Awards tonight, it&#x27;s coming from Bokeh Game Studio, who are led by Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama and boast a number of other people from the Silent Hill and Siren games. Check out the announcement trailer below for some deeply unpleasant monsters rampaging in a city.

It first arrived in early access two years ago, and has had loads of update adding new weapons and environments since. With today&#x27;s 1.0 launch, it adds even more content too, including new environments, tools, bots, checkpoints and more. That&#x27;s my weekend plans sorted.

                    <span>A new Elden Ring trailer fresh out The Game Awards introduces the story of the new game from Dark Souls developers FromSoftware and Game Of Thrones author George R.R. Martin. Well, I say it introduces the story, I mean it does it in a very Souls way, reeling off names like &quot;the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed&quot; without explaining anything. This seems like it would be the game&#x27;s opening cinematic so if you watch this trailer now, hey, it&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re starting Elden Ring two months early. Almost.

Spoice Mahreen was a lovely wee stompy hack-and-slash game, capturing the chunky feeling and ultraviolence of futurefascists in a way no other 40K game had. Ultramarine boy Captain Titus will return, this time cutting into the Tyranid hordes. Check out the announcement trailer.

I attended a hands-off preview, and it sure does look like a cartoony battle royale. The most standout thing to me was that you could put an entire cooked chicken in your pocket, or throw it at someone, so that&#x27;s something.

                    <span>Poor Saltzpyre has been waiting so patiently while all the other characters in Fatshark&#x27;s Warhammer: Vermintide 2  have received their snazzy new classes over the last year or so, but his wait is finally over. During The Game Awards, the developers announced Saltzpyre players will be able to become the Warrior Priest of Sigmar today, wielding a chunky, glowing hammer for some close-quarters action. He also has new armour that&#x27;s covered in skulls, which looks very edgy indeed.

                    <span>After needing seven years and several failed starts to successfully launch a game of their own, Amazon Game Studios are perhaps cautiously turning to other developers for their next. Today they announced a release date of February 11th for Lost Ark, the Diablo-y action-RPG first released by Smilegate in South Korea in 2019, which Amazon will publish in Europe and the Americas. Might be alright? It&#x27;ll free-to-play, anyway. Check out the new trailer from The Game Awards below.

Just like that. Next Thursday, the 16th of December, FF7 Remake will hit PC in its expanded Intergrade form. Like many other recent Square Enix RPG ports (and as expected), it will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store.

Should any Fae be reading this post, allow me to stress to our readers that this is vile propaganda, and to stress to you that I would very much like to wake up with all my teeth.

Alan Wake 2 is coming in 2023, and this time Remedy say it will be a survival horror game, not an action game. Also, Alan looks a bit like Jake Gyllenhaal now? Check out the trailer below.

But it was back at The Game Awards again this year, showing some brand new footage of Senua leading a group of fighters through a rather wet cave to face a giant. It looks fantastic, and incredibly eerie.

Helping out on development are Deck Nine Games, the studio behind Life Is Strange: True Colors. Check out the trailer below.

Published by Annapurna Interactive, it looks eccentric and colourful, with battles involve throwing ghostly cars and calling in giant family members to swat your opponents. It also features cooking, skateboarding, and possibly dancing (though I can&#x27;t quite tell from the trailer if the dancing is separate from the battling).

Sticking with naming conventions, it&#x27;s unsurprisingly called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It&#x27;ll be based on the film that came out in 1974, and the teaser trailer revealed at The Game Awards features a delightful creepy shot of leatherface.

A new &quot;gameplay&quot; trailer arrived today during the Game Awards pre-show today and yes: absolutely the spaceships still leave those pretty engine trails behind them. The trailer also gives neat-o peeks at spacebattles raging through the ruins of derelict megastructures. See for yourself below.

In one corner, the grim management sim Prison Architect, in which you carefully house and profit from criminals. In the other corner, Godfall, an ARPG looter-shooter about looking fabulous and smashing monsters to bits.

Yet I look at the new screenshots its developers posted to Twitter, and they look to me less like screenshots than the painted-over bullshots of yore. See them below and make up your own mind.

                    <span>This Is The President is a game that, partway through, had me worried it wouldn&#x27;t really qualify as a strategy game. As you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s about being the US President, and making lots of decisions about running the country and trying not to become too unpopular. But it&#x27;s far closer to interactive fiction than a simulation, with a main plot whose demands, if failed, will instantly end the game.
It has, however, got me considering what exactly &quot;political strategy game&quot; means.

But anyway! Now seems like a good time to take a closer look at Infinite’s PC system requirements, and which graphics settings you should tweak to get the best performance.

                    <span>I&#x27;m not normally a fan of children in games because, as noted in this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast, they get into the uncanny valley pretty quickly. But it&#x27;s the season to be jolly, so we&#x27;re talking about the times we thing kids in games are actually really good.
We do end up going on quite a lot of tangents, notably one on which Warhammer faction Matthew would play, and of course we ask Matthew for his thoughts on Mr. Beast&#x27;s Squid Game. This week&#x27;s Cavern Of Lies is in Nate&#x27;s control, which means he takes us to Dwarf Fortress, with predictable results.

Our picks below include both free and free-to-play games. Anything with a mandatory cost is excluded, as are mods or anything dependent on another purchase. The result is a list of games that run the gamut, from ARPGs to management, 2D platformers to co-op first-person shooters.

                    <span>After a crazy summer that saw Final Fantasy XIV’s playerbase expand dramatically during what was supposed to be a quiet period, it’s no surprise that anyone wanting to tuck into the new Endwalker expansion has a lot of queueing to do. But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you’re in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.
Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It’s huge. So huge that it’s going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.

                    <span>The next patch for Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is a big one: 78GB big. Ubisoft today announced that next week&#x27;s patch &quot;will &quot;will require players to re-download the entire game as part of a data restructuring.&quot; The whole base game, downloaded all over again. It&#x27;s for a good cause, at least. This should make the game load faster and generally run better, which is a nice change for a game to still have the motivation to deliver a year after launch, but maybe not such welcome news if you&#x27;re on a slow, throttled, or metered connection.

This much is clear in a new trailer which introduces the Slaneesh of Total War: Warhammer 3, clad in hot pinks and meat lingerie.

                    <span>Ever since Grand Theft Auto V launched eight years ago, fans have pleaded for Rockstar to release a singleplayer expansion, and received only multiplayer additions. Well, they still haven&#x27;t announced more singleplayer GTAV, but today they did announce one of the singleplayer stars will return in multiplayer. The next GTA Online update, named The Contract, will focus on campaign co-star Franklin, now running a &#x27;fixer&#x27; agency and needs our help dealing with a big client, Dr. Dre. Yup, it&#x27;s the D-R-E, and he&#x27;s bringing unreleased new music with him.

Launched on Monday, it&#x27;s named Axial Tilt, and what I played of it ahead of the live in-game event is rubbish. This is exactly what I have come to expect from the ongoing &quot;metaverse&quot; gold rush: marketing wrapped in a bad video game.

The servers have been overwhelmed since early access began last week and the thirst for furry friends in maid outfits simply won’t abate. Not only do the long login queues persist now it&#x27;s out properly, but there are plenty of errors plaguing the process which makes the wait even more frustrating. Thankfully, an update is being deployed today that should fix those server errors, increase server capacity, and make the login process a bit smoother.

                    <span>I don&#x27;t agree that being mean is always the funniest joke, but it is often the easiest joke, and let&#x27;s keep that in mind as we talk about next year&#x27;s Mario movie. You know, the one where Mario will be played by Chris Pratt. In the event that the film turns out to be good, I will enjoy it - like how the Sonic film was actually pretty decent, especially James Marsden&#x27;s star turn. But for now, Untitled Chris Pratt Mario Movie is bad, and a guilt-free laugh.
I saw this extremely funny bingo card on Twitter and my eye was drawn to a discussion in the replies. One of the square on the bingo card is &quot;Jump by Kriss Kross plays&quot; and someone else says they think it&#x27;s &quot;50/50 they choose Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot; over Kriss Kross&quot;, which leads yet a third person to bring up House Of Pain. From this exchange I am 100% sure that a jump-themed song will feature in this film - but the question is which?

In fairness it looks like a pretty comprehensive effort, combining expected tweaks like 21:9 ultrawide monitor support with performance-boosting Nvidia DLSS upscaling and even some general graphical upgrades. There’s a PC features trailer, too.

Unlike most other big games this year, Infinite has no preload option, so you won&#x27;t be able to have it downloaded and ready to go by the time it launches. Though, developers 343 Industries say you can make the download a little smaller by having the FPS&#x27;s multiplayer beta installed.

Fortunately, this shouldn&#x27;t be the case forever, because 343 Industries say that replayability is &quot;being worked on&quot;, though they don&#x27;t have a date for it just yet. (Mild spoilers for Infinite&#x27;s campaign below).

                    <span>There once was a time when buying a new gaming monitor was all about pushing toward a higher resolution. But priorities have shifted over the years, and while yes, it&#x27;s nice to play a game at a crisp 1440p or 4K, what&#x27;s equally important is that your game looks smooth and feels responsive. This is where refresh rates and response times come in, making your games flow better and feel more reactive. This is especially important in fast-paced multiplayer games, where a slick and accurate display can mean this between hitting your target and missing them.

                    <span>Oh Xbox Game Pass, that subscription service I constantly forget that I have. It&#x27;s always nice to be pleasantly surprised by new games I didn&#x27;t expect to play (or had no plans to buy outright). Microsoft have detailed a bunch more games I&#x27;ll likely be surprised by coming to Xbox Game Pass for PC when they launch over the next year or so - from epic space RPG Starfield, to Arkane&#x27;s vampire hunting adventure Redfall. It looks like they&#x27;re revealing more later this week too.

It is now nine years old, and so of course it&#x27;s received a 9th anniversary update. It has been &quot;updated for modern operating systems&quot;, with menu, HUD and UI fixes, and Mac and Linux ports. Lovely.

But what exactly is Resizable BAR, and assuming you have compatible hardware, is it really worth switching on?

Yeah, thirst for those bunnyboys will only make the queues longer.
