What makes it such a joy, whether in its original form on PlayStation or in this new PC version, is that being bad at it barely dents at its incredible appeal and overwhelming replayability.

For many, Returnal kind of came and went. Despite some of the hang-ups I had with the launch build, I stuck with it, and it was definitely worth my time. The PC edition not only benefits from a few PC-exclusive graphical tweaks, but the hindsight of fan-demanded features amid the PS5 version&#x27;s patches. In other words, this sci-fi rogue is still worth playing.

Returnal PC version options
Let&#x27;s touch on what the PC version offers first. While PS5 cross-play is notably missing, there&#x27;s support for Ultrawide at 21:9 and Super Ultrawide at 32:9 resolution settings, a DualSense control option, AMD FSR, and Nvidia DLSS.

[Update: The PowerWash Simulator Special Midgar Pack will launch on all platforms March 2, free to all players.]
In a very fun, and very surprising piece of news, goofy window-washer PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab has revealed that it is collaborating with Square Enix on a special Final Fantasy VII DLC expansion, which will see our crew of dirt-blasters head out to the city Midgar for some deep-cleaning action.
The new &quot;Midgar Special Pack&quot; DLC will give PowerWash Simulator players the opportunity to clean up some familiar locales and enemies located around the miserable, smog-covered &#x27;berg, giving the iconic Final Fantasy VII cityscape a sparkly sheen not seen since before the arrival of capitalist scumbags Shinra. Tifa&#x27;s bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud&#x27;s motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona&#x27; and the devastating &quot;Guard Scorpion&quot; robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.

Unfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated &quot;Final Fantasy VII Day&quot;. We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available. In the meantime, you can still go and spruce up Croft Manor for yer gurl Lara.
PowerWash Simulator is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Go face to face with Lady D
Capcom has released a new trailer for the incoming PSVR2 edition of its blockbuster horror title Resident Evil Village. In addition, the publisher announced that a free demo will be made available alongside the hardware&#x27;s launch, which will take place on February 22.
The VR adaptation of Resident Evil Village will see players going face to face with the horrors of The House Beneviento like never before. Fully immersive 3D technology is expected to bolster the forests, huts, castles, and corridors for maximum player impact, allowing hapless users to come face-to-face with a gallery of infamous and terrifying villains, including Heisenberg, Lady Dimitrescu, and, yes, that baby. No Thank You. Not unless it&#x27;s the puppet versions... I&#x27;d hang out with them all day.

The PlayStation VR 2 technology launches worldwide on February 22, and is hoping to set a new market standard for immersive, responsive, virtual reality hardware. While the technology is unquestionably impressive, the PSVR2 unit&#x27;s exceptionally high price, ($550 USD), will most certainly make it something of a niche purchase within an already niche community. Still, how much do you want to pay for a date with Lady D? Can you put a price on what would surely be the best, and last, night of your life?
Resident Evil Village VR Mode will officially release later in 2023, available as a free download for all Resident Evil Village players.

Somebody deserves a whole stack of lollipops — PlatinumGames has proudly announced that its dazzling hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash sequel Bayonetta 3 has smashed past one million global sales. The long-long-long awaited sequel first launched on Nintendo Switch back in October 2022.
The sales milestone was modestly announced on the official PlatinumGames Twitter account, and sees the popular series&#x27; second sequel become the fastest-selling title of the Bayonetta series. The adventure sees the sultry Umbra Witch take on the powerful &quot;Homunculi&quot; arsenal in an effort to prevent the very tearing of space and time itself. Over the course of the story, Bayonetta is aided by friends from alternate universes, as well as a young witch-in-training known as Viola.

After what seemed like an endless wait for release, Bayonetta 3 finally launched to a mixed, but mostly positive reception from critics and fans. While most everybody was pleased with the iconic and chaotic combat, as well as its seamless integration into the mise-en-scene, many fans were left a little disappointed by the story and the overall character arc for their favorite naughty spellcaster.
The next title in the series will be spin-off release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon. This cutesy-looking title will see the young girl who would eventually become Bayonetta embark upon one of her very first adventures, exploring the Avalon forest alongside her first demon companion, Cheshire. Bayonetta Origins will launch on Nintendo Switch on March 17.
Bayonetta 3 is available right now, exclusively on Nintendo Switch.

Welcome back! It’s time for a new episode of the Spot Dodge Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: Tonight we’ll be talking all about the magnificent and recently stealth-released Metroid Prime Remastered. Along with that, the team discusses the difference between a remaster and a remake -- And how even game devs are split on the meaning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;hdkaKidkq7A&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Destructoid
I know what you&#x27;re thinking, the difference between a remaster and a remake is clear. A game like Wind Waker HD is a remaster and Resident Evil 2 (2019) is a remake. Wind Waker retained the same skeleton as the original but overhauled the graphics. Essentially being 90% the same game. Whereas Resident Evil 2 was a full reimagining of the original game.

                              <span>The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.
But what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.

This month’s list of leavers includes a few heavy hitters, like the horrifying Alien Isolation, and a duo of big JRPGs that are likely impossible to binge in just two weeks.

It also confirms that support for both DLSS and FSR upscalers is on the way, and asks those who’ve found their hunts scuppered by dodgy performance to report their issues to EA’s support team.

                              <span>Loathe as I am to become one of those &quot;want to feel old?&quot; types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era&#x27;s City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother&#x27;s desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it&#x27;s back, baby.
Pharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the &quot;A New Era&quot; part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s&#x27; extra crunchy. It&#x27;s a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.

                              <span>Riot have announced a brand new (previously leaked) League Of Legends spin-off coming this year. The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is a 2D action RPG from Digital Sun, the dev team behind Moonlighter, which was a delightful fusion of roguelike action and shopkeeping. The Mageseeker is launching this spring, while the other LoL spin-offs have also received release windows for 2023.

                              <span>Spells &amp; Secrets is an eye-catching, dungeon-crawling, magic-slinging action-rougelite with a lot of potential — and it&#x27;s set in an academy for wizards, so basically catnip to me as a fan of a good high school story. I first became aware of this upcoming game while covering last summer&#x27;s Future Of Play Direct, and I&#x27;ve been itching to write something about it ever since. Happily, as part of RPS Magic Week, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to speak with Florian Mann, CEO and co-founder of Spells &amp; Secrets development team Alchemist Interactive.

Now developer Balancing Monkey is back for another go at spacefaring management, but this time your city is built on top of a space whale, rather than being terrorised by one. Their follow-up, Beyond These Stars, will be hitting early access on PC later this year.

                              <span>I kind of hate mechanical hard drives these days. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap per gigabyte, yes they&#x27;re fairly reliable, yes they&#x27;re absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don&#x27;t care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you&#x27;re used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. 
So when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I&#x27;d bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn&#x27;t have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I&#x27;d made the right call to ditch spinning rust.

                              <span>Riot Games released a promotional video this morning revealing its plans to release three League of Legends spin-off games this year. Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. 


The Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. 
Convergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Song of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. 
Riot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we&#x27;re curious to see how these other projects fair and if they&#x27;ll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix&#x27;s well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Dwarven Vow #108: Let sleeping dogs lie.
Though it’s never quite had the popularity of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest franchises, the Tales series has set a good reputation as the ‘other’ classic JRPG series that’s consistently maintained a decent quality for quite some time now. Back in 2004, Namco (no Bandai yet) was only on the fifth iteration of the Tales series, which made the bold transition to full 3D with the release of Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube. Sporting an attractive cel-shaded visual style and packing enough content to last for hundreds of hours, there was a lot to love about this release back when the pickings were much slimmer for great RPGs on Nintendo consoles. Now, Tales of Symphonia Remastered--which is based on the 2013 PS3 rerelease, which in turn uses the PS2 Japan-exclusive version as a base--has brought the classic experience to modern hardware and while it still remains a charming adventure, it’s definitely showing its age.
The story is set in the land of Sylvarant, which is experiencing a bit of an ecological crisis. A critical shortage of mana caused by the lingering effects of a war from thousands of years back means that the world is itself dying, and time is running out fast for the inhabitants. The only hope is for the Regeneration to take place, in which a person dubbed “The Chosen” opens various seals across the land to awaken the goddess and return life to all things. You take the role of Lloyd, good friend of the current Chosen, Colette. Lloyd is the headstrong son of a dwarven smith, and after he inadvertently causes a terrible tragedy in his village, Lloyd sets out with his best friend Genis to accompany and protect their friend Colette on her journey to fulfill her Chosen duties and save the world from destruction.

                              <span>&quot;Honey, where&#x27;s my super suit?&quot;.
Metroid&#x27;s protagonist, Samus Aran, has a rather unique privilege in the world of Nintendo. Unlike characters like Mario, Link, and Kirby, all of whom retain the same general look across their respective franchises (okay, Link is a little more varied than the other two, but still), Samus&#x27; basic design can be altered quite drastically from game to game.
Granted, the character needs to remain relatively recognisable for fans, so you can&#x27;t go nuts with this kind of thing, but when you examine Samus&#x27;s overall suit design in each of the mainline Metroid games, it&#x27;s surprisingly different in a lot of ways.

Cuphead and Final Fantasy aren&#x27;t two games we often put together, but today, that changes. StudioMDHR has shared some limited edition artwork that will be included in the Japanese Deluxe Edition (through SuperDeluxe Games) from none other than Yoshitaka Amano, the incredible lead artist on the first six Final Fantasy games.
Known for designing many of the series&#x27; iconic characters, all of the logos, and even providing illustrations after he stepped down from the role after Final Fantasy VI, Amano&#x27;s work is beloved around the world. And StudioMDHR have collaborated with the artist, who has designed the jacket for the The Delicious Last Course&#x27;s soundtrack jacket. The developer shared the work on Twitter, and to say it looks amazing is an understatement.

Back in 1999 Nintendo revealed a Super Smash Bros. marketing campaign which makes those &quot;everyone is here&quot; Ultimate trailers pale in comparison. The company hosted an event called Super Smash Bros. Slamfest &#x27;99 and it saw the likes Pikachu, Donkey Kong, Mario and Yoshi take to the ring in a wrestling match in front of a live audience.
The event took place in Las Vegas on 24th April 1999, where the crowd could watch their childhood video game idols beat each other up before their very eyes. Basically, the event sounds insane, and until today we had seen very little of it thanks to the woes of film photography and 1990s streaming practices.

Limited Run Games has revealed an upcoming physical edition for Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation, with pre-orders set to launch on February 21st, 2023 at 12pm ET.

Now its developers say they want to release smaller and cheaper expansions more regularly, with quarterly updates filling the gaps in between.

                              <span>Terra Nil is terraforming sim, in which you land on a barren wasteland, construct machines for restoring it to a lush, green wilderness, and then pack up your toys and leave. It&#x27;s one of the games I&#x27;m most looking forward to in 2023, and its latest trailer just cements that. It&#x27;s three-minutes-long, has no music, and simply lets you revel in the &quot;satisfaction in reclamation&quot;.

Both seem adorable.

                              <span>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if there’s a cute animal game that looks like it’s going to make me cry, then sign me up, I’m ready to go. In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it&#x27;s going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.
Blanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn&#x27;t help feeling like I&#x27;d been left out in the cold.

Thankfully, So May It Be has been my gateway to Witchcraft 101. It’s a sapphic dating sim about a bunch of witches just hanging out doing witchy things. You&#x27;re part of a small coven with your three friends, and you all meet online every night to chat about school, shitty part-time jobs, and of course, witchcraft. At the end of each evening, you can privately ask one of your friends to hang out the next day 1 on 1, getting to know them better and just doing cool witch shit.

I’m sure Park Beyond will be a wholesome bit of fun - creating outlandish rollercoasters and managing the nuts &amp; bolts of a made-up business is always a good time. But, good grief, there’s something seriously disturbing about its latest trailer.

                              <span>It’s been five whole years since the Firewatch devs announced their tomb-raiding adventure, In The Valley Of Gods, and in that time the idea of the game itself has fossilised. The first-person archaeology game was put on hold in 2019 after Valve acquired Campo Santo and had them support other Valve projects like Half-Life: Alyx. Now Campo&#x27;s in-limbo game has a December 2029 listing on Steam, which almost certainly means nothing, but it’s fun to dust off some memories.

                              <span>Overwatch 2’s third season is well underway, adding more of the usual maps, modes, and cosmetics. The big surprise this season is the Valentine’s themed Loverwatch, a non-canon text adventure that allows you to court either Mercy or Genji. Naturally, I chose to date Genji (described as Overwatch’s “bad boy”), and the results were surprising. It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.

                              <span>Most great platforming games dabble with gravity at some point. It&#x27;s one of those classic, age-old moments where you&#x27;re suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that&#x27;s still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda&#x27;s oeuvre in all the right ways.

As you face down endless enemies, you draw and play cards representing individual attacks and power-ups, drafting new and more powerful cards as you level up. I dig it! In another time, this might have been a wee hit Flash game on Newgrounds.

                              <span>I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I&#x27;m guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I&#x27;m sad to report that it isn&#x27;t any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn&#x27;t know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must&#x27;ve gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what&#x27;s arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon&#x27;s Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, &quot;It&#x27;s a no from me&quot;.

The team described Hyper Light Breaker as a co-op roguelike, but the game has now switched to an ambitious, procedurally generated open-world.

                              <span>Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.
Those new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.

This is excellent news, as it means you&#x27;ve still got time to give Roots Of Yggdrasil a go, a chill, Viking citybuilder that has such strong Okami vibes with its inky, cell-shaded visuals, strong black outlines, and flute and harp-driven soundtrack that I kept having to remind myself I wasn&#x27;t just playing a spin-off of Clover&#x27;s seminal Zelda-like. I swear, if it weren&#x27;t for the smattering of autumnal trees in the tutorial level, its grassy plains, tall mountains and bright blue river would have been a dead ringer for Okami&#x27;s Kamiki Village.

                              <span>Everyone’s favourite lesbian road trip RPG Get In The Car, Loser! has released its second expansion pack and this one’s chunky. For the uninitiated, Get In The Car, Loser! begins the way all retro RPGs do, with a group of young misfits who decide to fight a world-ending calamity, or sometimes to fight God. The only difference here is that it’s named after one-of-many iconic Mean Girls quotes, and yes, your party features lesbians. The antithesis of Final Fantasy 15, really.

What&#x27;s the best Metroid game of all time? The reveal and release in 2021 of &#x27;Metroid 5&#x27;, better known as Metroid Dread, caused a flurry of excitement and the surprise release of Metroid Prime Remastered following the February 2023 Nintendo Direct had many of us going back to either revisit games in the franchise or catch up on ones we missed.

Zelink might be one of the biggest ships out there, and it&#x27;s hardly controversial to want Zelda and Link, the two owners of the Triforce that aren&#x27;t evil, to end up together. They&#x27;re entwined in destiny, fated to keep meeting, and falling into the princess/hero dichotomy that keeps them separate once more. And yet, they&#x27;ve never really had a romantic relationship. It&#x27;s wild!
We&#x27;re big Zelink shippers here at NL, of course, so we&#x27;ve created the ultimate list of the best Zelda/Link relationships as represented in the Legend of Zelda games. We&#x27;ve skipped a few of the games — notably spin-offs like Hyrule Warriors and Four Swords — but all the mainline games are here.

The notion of two disparate species of animals coming together to help one another is not particularly new in the world of storytelling. The trope goes all the way back to the likes of Peter Rabbit, in which our intrepid titular hero enlists the assistance of Squirrel Nutkin to help fend off the dastardly fox, Mr. Tod. It’s a concept that just works and is immediately endearing to both children and adults; so it’s no wonder, then, that Blanc resonated with so many upon its initial reveal. But does the actual gameplay hold up? Mostly, but with some important caveats.
Blanc stars two playable characters — a wolf cub and a fawn — both of whom have been inadvertently cut off from their respective families during a sudden snowstorm. As the two try to get their bearings, they run into each other over two sides of a frozen river, and ultimately decide to help each other return to their parents and siblings. Considering there’s absolutely no dialogue in Blanc, developer Casus Ludi has done a remarkable job in communicating exactly what’s going on with the two main characters in question, despite the admittedly simplistic plot.

Are you still recovering from Metroid Prime Remastered&#x27;s surprise announcement and release? Well, how about some more detailed analysis on Retro Studios and Iron Galaxy&#x27;s stellar rerelease from the team over at Digital Foundry?
Comparing the new Switch release to both the GameCube and Wii titles, Digital Foundry has given the game a pretty glowing overview, while also pointing out a few minor quibbles. And we really do mean minor. The game runs at a consistent 60fps according to Digital Foundry&#x27;s tests in both handheld and docked, no matter how chaotic the screen gets, while resolution is at 900p on the big screen and 600p on a Switch screen. But it looks stunning on an OLED, all thanks to the game&#x27;s improved lighting.

Last week, the fantastic Boss Fight Books began revealing Season 6 of its documentary-style books along with the first book, which looks at PaRappa the Rapper. And today, the publisher has announced that the second book will be very much in our wheelhouse by focusing on Animal Crossing.
Written by Kelsey Lewin, co-director of The Video Game History Foundation and co-owner of Pink Gorilla Games in Seattle, Washington, the book promises to look at the magic of the first game in the series, which had humble origins as a Japan-only N64 release in Dо̄butsu no Mori. The game eventually came to the West thanks to a GameCube port with expanded features.

Masahiro Sakurai continues to share insights into his storied history in the video game industry along with game design tips and his own philosophy. And today, the creator of the Super Smash Bros. series has pulled back the curtain on one of his first major projects after going freelance — the 2005 DS puzzle game Meteos.
While working as a supervisor and doing consulting work on various video games, Sakurai was approached by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, a developer who formerly worked at Sega. Mizuguchi wanted Sakurai to make a falling-block puzzle game. Amusingly, Sakurai admits that he&#x27;s &quot;really bad at falling-block puzzle games&quot;, especially Puyo-Puyo (though he did supervision work on Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche, a Puyo-Puyo-inspired Kirby puzzle game), but says that working on a new genre was a &quot;fascinating challenge&quot;.

                              <span>YES CHEF, RIGHT AWAY CHEF.
We have a rather delicious dish ready for you today, folks. Publisher Nacon has exclusively shared with us the debut footage of Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator on Switch, with the game scheduled to launch on February 23rd, 2023 in Europe and March 28th, 2023 in North America.
The trailer is quite clever, all told, showcasing a woman sitting in a restaurant and seemingly directly controlling the chef with her Switch while he prepares her dish. Peppered in between are short snippets of footage from the Switch version of the game, but we get a real good portion to chew on closer to the end.

Looking back on Wales Interactive’s Five Dates in 2023, more than two years after its debut, reveals a fascinating glimpse into what life was like during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a game that leans heavily into the idea that the dating world has migrated online, forcing singletons to conduct awkward interview-style conversations with potential suitors. We certainly enjoyed it for what it was back in 2020, but we’d perhaps argue that it’s aged better as a sort of historical artefact; a brief portal into a world that most of us would quite happily forget.
Its sequel, Ten Dates, isn’t afforded the same novelty. While the pandemic marches on across the globe, many countries have taken to treating the virus as endemic, thus returning to some semblance of normality (whatever that looks like these days). With this in mind, Ten Dates is very much a traditional affair; a game that puts its focus squarely on face-to-face interactions within typical social settings. It’s undoubtedly missing the “novelty” of remote interactions that made the first game so unique, but the focus on real-life conversations makes for a more enjoyable experience all round.

                              <span>Well, the first 151 anyway.
A tattoo artist from Stowmarket, Suffolk is aiming to tattoo all 151 original Pokémon on fans and customers to raise money for the Blue Cross animal welfare charity.
William Langford, who owns Zen Tattoo Art, has been a tattoo artist for 12 years and loved Pokémon as a kid, BBC News reports. Langford wanted to &quot;spend the year doing something good for people/animals&quot; and, as a result, decided to start tattooing the first 151 Pokémon and donating the money from those tattoos to charity.

If there&#x27;s one thing that we are quickly learning about The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it&#x27;s that it is set to be absolutely packed with Easter eggs and callbacks.
The latest Super Bowl trailer wore this sentiment on its sleeve, remaking the original theme song from 1989&#x27;s Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and bringing the references by the bucketload (seriously, check out the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing website to see how many there are). One callback that a few people have pointed to online (though it is yet to be confirmed) is a cameo from the Super Show itself as there are claims that the latest trailer features none other than Jeannie Elias (voice actor for Princess Toadstool).

Ah, 14th February. The day of love. Of telling your significant other how much they mean to you. Of exchanging gifts and cards and posting them to social media for the whole world to see. Is there anything more romantic?
But what if today has snuck up on you? Yes, there was the red heart drawn on your calendar but the chance to get a gift passed you by and now you find yourself card-less on the day of Cupid&#x27;s target practice! Fortunately, Nintendo has you covered with its range of completely free, downloadable Kirby cards.

                              <span>Feel the Theatrhyhm.
If there’s one thing pretty much everyone can agree on, it’s that the Final Fantasy series has some incredible music. With a 35-year legacy and around 100 games bearing the Final Fantasy moniker, it’s not surprising that the music from the series is some of the most recognisable in video game history. Theatrhythm, then, is a no-brainer. A series of rhythm games that package together some of gaming&#x27;s best-loved melodies, there’s no better way to celebrate this storied franchise and its vast catalogue of music.
Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, then, is the best yet in that respect. As the first new entry since 2016’s arcade game All-Star Carnival and the first home release since 2014’s Curtain Call, Final Bar Line is simply a delight. It’s a bonanza of musical magic, stuffed and bursting with things to do. There are more songs, more games represented, more characters, and new modes, and it never feels like too much of a good thing.

This release — announced during last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation — marks the official debut of the long-running franchise on the international stage for the first time since its 1994 inception.
eBaseball: Power Pros, officially recognized by The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WSBC) is a scaled-down version of the classic sport, featuring simple-to-learn controls, adorable chibi characters, and a huge roster of 300 characters. Form your team, take to the diamond, and become the most famous baseball team on the planet.

Alternately, multiplayer support allows for up to four players to team up for online and offline action, battering up for some friendly competition, or entering online tournaments via the new Championship Mode. Wade through the statistics of the title&#x27;s mammoth roster to ensure that you synergize the best pitchers, catchers, batters, and backstops in the business. For such a tiny title, WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros looks to have a pretty big personality.
Best of all, it will cost interested parties very little to get in on the action. WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros is currently available from PSN and the Nintendo eShop for a single dollar (though some global markets will have to abide by their territory&#x27;s &quot;minimum pricing&quot; laws). So it won&#x27;t break the bank to get you and your pals out and into the dugout. Swing, batter, batter, batter, batter...

Capcom has rolled out two more character themes for its upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6, which is headed our way ever so slowly on PC and console platforms — This time around, the new themes herald the return of Jamaican superstar Dee Jay Maximum, and the debut of a wealthy industrialist, clouded in intrigue and shrouded in mystery, who goes by the simple moniker of &quot;JP&quot;
With the release of these pieces for Dee Jay and JP, we now have heard the themes for all of the revealed characters to date. Incredibly, we are still waiting on our first gameplay glimpses of Russian wrestler Zangief, British special agent Cammy, and Mexican newcomer Lily. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll be seeing these three characters in action soon, rounding out the launch roster for the…</span>

I haven’t done much diving into deck-builders, which seems to be riding the trend wave in the indie market. I’m honestly not sure why, since every time I’ve interacted with one, I’ve enjoyed it. Take, for example, Mahokenshi.
I tried the demo of Mahokenshi a long while back and came away impressed, yet somehow the final release still snuck up on me. Its mix of board-game style, turn-based, card-centric gameplay felt rather powerful in my first experience, so I was excited to see how the whole package turned out.

                              <span>A new development in the controversy surrounding Mundfish
Mick Gordon, the composer for Mundfish’s upcoming FPS, Atomic Heart, has announced that he will be donating the fees her received for scoring the game to the Austrailian Red Cross&#x27; Ukraine Crisis Appeal for use in their humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.

The announcement is significant as it comes following the concern that developer Mundfish is allegedly supported by investors with hands in Russia’s war in Ukraine; or that funds from Atomic Heart’s sales may directly help the Russian government. While Mundfish is based in Cyprus, there have been allegations that it&#x27;s mainly headquartered in Moscow.
Moreover, the studio allegedly has investors that have relations with Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. While nothing has been directly proven, a lot of allegations have been brought up, and Mundfish hasn’t exactly stepped in to set the record straight itself, stating that it simply does “not comment on politics.”
While Mick Gordon has not specifically commented on these accusations, this move is at least one that may help offset some of the concerns. However, it’s not the same as if Mundfish itself donated proceeds to aid Ukraine. I would encourage you to do your own research into Mundfish’s connection with the war in Ukraine, reach your own conclusions, and decide for yourself if purchasing Atomic Heart is reasonably moral for you.
Mick Gordon has scored titles such as Wolfenstein: The New Order, Killer Instinct, and Doom Eternal. Atomic Heart is available February 21 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.

Xbox has confirmed that the launch of its hugely successful Xbox Game Pass subscription service has had a notable negative impact on the long-term sales prospects of many of the titles added to its rotating catalog of games.
The admission comes as part of a report by The UK Competition and Markets Authority, (as seen by GamesIndustry.biz) which was commissioned as part of Microsoft&#x27;s proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard. According to the report, many titles that were made temporarily available in the Game Pass service then saw a decline in physical/digital sales for the 12-month period following their removal from the service.
The average percentage by which sales have declined was redacted from the record.

                              <span>What is a man? A miserable pile of smooches!
It might be Valentine’s Day, but we’re going to have to wait a bit longer for that love blood to hit the water. The Deep End Games and 2124 Publishing has announced that Romancelvania, their unholy cross-breed of Metroidvania and dating sim, will be hitting the bedsheets March 7, 2023.
Romancelvania introduces us to a Dracula whose confidence is still laid up after a savage beating at the hands of the Van Helsing clan. Their lover left them, their minions don’t respect them, and evil just doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. Death gets fed up with this pity party and sets Dracula up with their own dating show. It’s time to choose from 12 “lucky” singles and help the dark lord (or lady) get their mojo back. Peer pressure is the proven way to turn a spark into a flame.
[embed]https://youtu.be/-iJkv94HlBA[/embed]
Gameplay is a clever combination of gated exploration and choice-driven dialogue. You’re given the option to choose a body type, and the dating options cover whatever it is you’re into, whether you’re more a Medusa or werewolf kind of person. The whole affair is fully voiced, which is an appreciated bit of extra effort.
It feels like simultaneously forever and not that long ago that I played the demo and came away impressed but skeptical. The whole concept seems like it will be extremely difficult to get right, given the amount of player agency available and the two disparate genres that are trying to be married. However, nothing about the demo implied that The Deep End Games is in over the depth, so provided the rest of the game matches the bar set by the earlier peek we got, then we’re in for a real treat.
Romancelvania is out on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 7.

                              <span>Paradise Lost
This week sees the launch of Electronic Arts period-piece adventure Wild Hearts, the mythical action-RPG set within the age of feudal Japan — Developer Omega Force, of Dynasty Warriors fame, has released a new trailer introducing players to the village and people of Minato, located deep within the beautiful overworld known as Azuma.
Wild Hearts will present players will a fresh take on the... well... the Monster Hunting genre that has proven especially popular in recent years. The player will take up the mantle of a custom hunter, and team with the people of Minato on a quest to track and defeat a menagerie of behemoth beasts known as &quot;The Kemono&quot; — utilizing each creature&#x27;s soulful &quot;Celestial Thread&quot; in order to renovate and rebuild the province of Azuma before it is lost completely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_grFGQ2oWUQ&amp;t
As you can see from the trailer above, Wild Hearts will boast some amazing and awe-inspiring creature designs, while offering up a selection of varied weaponry, gear, and elemental skills in order to aid our hunters in their battles with these incredible land gods. From the village of Minato, the player will enlist the help of various arts, from alchemists to healers, blacksmiths to guides, in order to best prepare for the long and hazardous journeys that lie ahead.
Hone finely crafted skills of the &quot;Karakuri&quot; in order to build a variety of environmental traps and defenses, and experiment with a wide arsenal of weapons in order to best equip you and your party for the hunt. And looking at some of the monsters on display in this preview, you&#x27;re probably going to need all of the help you can get. I mean, I&#x27;d come with you, but I&#x27;ve got a bit of a bad back. There in spirit, though.
Wild Hearts launches February 17 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Be sure to check out our own Chris Carter&#x27;s initial thoughts in his Review-in-Progress.

                              <span>St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre
The sequence comes around an hour into the story and lasts approximately 95 seconds. Lieutenant Hannah Stone, freshly showered from another terrible, violent day on the job, walks into the cafeteria of her headquarters for dinner. At the counter, she is handed fish soup, Bratwurst curry with potatoes, a blackcurrant jelly, and a steaming cup of coffee. Well earned.
Taking a seat at an empty table, Hannah stares at the bowl. Atop her soup is a severed fish head. It stares at her. Hannah looks it in the eye, which peers back into her soul. Hollow. Unblinking. Accusing. Hannah discards the soup to one side, where even a hungry cat decides not to partake in the free meal. Picking up her fork, Hannah stabs it into the bratwurst, or at least attempts to, as the cutle…</span>

                              <span>Sure beats a bunch of photoshopped heads
As Illumination continues to ramp up the marketing campaign for its upcoming release The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the studio has released a series of character posters spotlighting the Mushroom Kingdom and the heroes and villains that reside within.
The posters are strikingly attractive, packed out with color and dynamism, and see protagonists such as Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Peach headed out to battle with the likes of Donkey Kong, Shy Guy, Magikoopa, and, of course, Big Bad Bowser himself. Each poster spotlights a particular character and world — from Rainbow Road, to Donkey Kong Island, to Bowser&#x27;s Castle — with each image hoping to get fans&#x27; hype engines suitably in gear for the movie&#x27;s spring release.

I think my favorite is Peach ridin&#x27; the Rainbow Road, I love the bright colours and the wild perspective. The drama of the Bowser&#x27;s Army image is also top-tier. The poster which sees Peach, Toad, and Mario all sat admiring the Mushroom Kingdom is quite lovely. A text-free version of that would look great on the wall of any video game fan.
Take a look at the posters in the tweets below and see which is your pick of the bunch.
Mario
Luigi
Peach
Toad
Bowser
Donkey Kong
Group Shot
Mushroom Kingdom
Bowser&#x27;s Army
The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), Seth Rogan (Donkey Kong), and Charlie Day (Luigi). It is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7.
Oh, and be sure to check out the easter-egg-filled Super Bowl ad.

                              <span>Not every Final Fantasy game is great, but maybe every Final Fantasy game is great
Last year, I visited Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to see the 35th-anniversary edition of the Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy concert series. I don&#x27;t love every Final Fantasy game, but sitting in that concert hall, with a comically overpriced music box in a bag at my feet, for a couple of hours, I did. And when I play Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, I love every Final Fantasy game again.
Depending on which games you want to count, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, a mechanical celebration of the music of Final Fantasy, is somewhere between the third and seventh Theatrhythm game. I love the series — developer indieszero has an impressive understanding of what makes music interesting, and these games h…</span>

On February 12, 2023, Destiny 2 game director Joe Blackburn posted a cryptic tweet featuring nothing but a plain wall with a sticky note attached to it. Seemingly uneventful, right? Well, not exactly. That sticky note promised a &quot;State of the Game&quot; post on Bungie&#x27;s website for the following day consisting of no less than 5,300 words, covering Destiny 2 Lightfall and the year ahead.
For those new to these articles, every now and then the Destiny developer team will share a blog on the state of the game, the future as they see it, and changes coming to future expansions. Generally speaking, these blog posts come about once every year or two, have plenty of detail, the contents are rarely if ever leaked, and it usually spells exciting new directions for the game.

Metroid Prime Remastered shadow-dropped as part of last week&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. And while players have been enjoying the refreshed version of Samus&#x27; adventure, some developers are calling out issues with credits for the work on both Metroid Prime Remastered and its origins.
Former Prime developer Zoid Kirsch shared this screenshot of the credits over the weekend, which uses a blanket phrase to credit the teams that worked on both Metroid Prime and its Wii version.
&quot;While many studios did amazing work on the remaster, I&#x27;m letdown Metroid Prime&#x27;s Remaster does not include the full original game credits,&quot; said Kirsch. &quot;I worked with so many amazing people on the game and everyone&#x27;s name should be included in the remaster, not just a single card like this.&quot;
You can see the credits for yourself in uploaded game completion VODs like this one. Though it attributes Retro staff, as well as Airship Images Limited, Gamesim, Iron Galaxy Studios, and others who worked on the project, it does close with one solitary block for the original GameCube game and the Wii version.
Former developer Jack Mathews called it a travesty, not just for his own work on the original that could have been replaced, but for others&#x27; that may have stuck through to the final remaster.
The credits issue in games
Games have, historically, had issues with crediting the work developers have done on them. Reports at sites like Kotaku have highlighted how credit for contributions have been used as both rewards and punitive measures.
Metroid as a series even encountered this with Dread, as several developers claimed they weren&#x27;t credits for their work on the project. Other developers have also seen accusations of withholding credits.

Destiny 2: Lightfall is set to release on February 28, 2023, and Guardians globally are preparing their characters for the penultimate DLC in the Destiny Light and Dark saga from Bungie. There are multiple ways to do this, and over the years many have discovered the optimal way to ensure they head into Lightfall with the best jump-start possible.

                              <span>In submissions to the European Commission, rightsholders insist that intermediaries must kill pirate IPTV streams within minutes and proactive internet blocking should be ramped up across Europe. In its submission to the EC, Cloudflare reveals that a voluntary site-blocking program in a member state saw an ISP block thousands of entirely legal sites, on several separate occasions.

I first heard of Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken on Game Centre CX where it was introduced as “kyuukyoku no kusoge” or “ultimate crappy game.” The host, Shinya Arino, tackled it as part of a segment that ran throughout 9 of the 10 episodes of season 3 (2005). The concept of the segment is that he’d try to tackle the game, and every time he’d get stuck or confused, he’d call a viewer to get hints on what to do.
He was eventually able to complete the game, but Super Monkey Daibouken is so incomprehensible that, in one of the episodes, he made absolutely no progress, and none of the viewers could help him.
I decided that I’d try that out for myself. Obviously, no one views me (that I know of), so my goal was to complete the game using the same viewer hints that Arino…</span>

Getting your significant other the perfect gift for Valentine’s Day can feel overwhelming. Some people like chocolates and flowers, others prefer a memorable date night under a starry sky. That said, if your partner ever longingly looked at you and said “actually, I want some mice,” then Game Freak is here to affirm your tastes in romantic companions.
From now through Valentine’s Day, Tandemaus will appear as part of blue star Tera Raid encounters in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet. Unlike past spotlight events, these monsters can range from 1-5 star difficulty depending on your progress through the game. This Pokemon pair has potential to sport any Tera Type in the game, though five star battles will have a preference towards the Fairy Tera Type. Note that T…</span>

The Final Fantasy XIV free trial is big. Like, really big.
Between all the content in A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward expansion, you could theoretically play this trial for 1000 hours and still find goals to pursue. Whether that’s advisable is up to you, but the point is, you can do a lot before buying the game. Since a subscription will be required to continue playing once you purchase the title, you could potentially save yourself months of fees by identifying the content you’d like to finish before upgrading. You will have some restrictions, but we’ll get into that later.
That said, if you’re beginning your journey in Eorzea, it can be hard to tell what exactly you should finish. While we can&#x27;t list every possible goal, below are the major o…</span>

Nacon is gearing up for its next Nacon Connect live stream, where the publisher plans to show off an array of its upcoming releases, spearheaded by Teyon&#x27;s RoboCop: Rogue City and Daedalic Entertainment&#x27;s RPG adaptation The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. The stream will take place on March 9.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jQ2hZ-4JCTE&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;Nacon
Originally announced in the summer of 2021, RoboCop: Rogue City will see The Future of Law Enforcement laying down the Prime Directives in the city of Old Detroit. Fans are hoping that the title will capture the ridiculous violence and biting satire of Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s fantastic 1987 movie. Actor Paul Weller is confirmed to be on board to provide his voice and likeness to the irreplaceable Alex Murphy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;YYrJdAdi1WI&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;PlayStation
The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-RPG that has unfortunately fallen into something of a development spiral, having been delayed several times since its initial announcement. Initially slated for launch in 2021 and then 2022, Daedalic Entertainment is yet to announce an official launch date for The Precious&#x27; arrival on PC and console platforms. Perhaps this Nacon Connect will finally mark the calendar with ink, giving LOTR fans something particularly intriguing to look forward to.
In addition to RoboCop: Rogue City and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, the Nacon Connect will feature appearances from Robin Hood-themed multiplayer title Gangs of Sherwood, motorbike sim TT3: Ride on the Edge, psychological WWI horror Ad Infinitum, and fantasy roguelike Ravenswatch. We can also expect to see the latest from the publisher&#x27;s line of gaming hardware and accessories, including headphones, microphones, and keyboards.
You can check out the stream over on the official Nacon YouTube channel on March 9, with the action scheduled to kick off at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST.

Valentine’s Day is right around the corner, so it’s time to get yourself in the right mindset with some saucy dating sims. Scythe Dev Team, creators of game-I-will-not-shut-up-about, Happy’s Humble Burger Farm, have you covered with Love at First Squeak, a dating sim about dating.
Love at First Squeak has you hitting the Rat Hole club all hot and heavy. You meet a buffet of steamy singles like Chip Quick, Ruth, and some other people who were less irresistible. Get to know them real, real quick, and then whisk them away to the VIP room to ignite the chemical fumes of your passionate gasoline.

Shh. Come closer. Love at First Squeak is a really short and goofy dating sim, but it’s really just mini-game #1 of 10 that foretells the coming of Scythe Dev Team’s virtual reality horror FPS, Project Meganet. It’s pretty short, but it invites you to play through it multiple times to really scratch at the sinister underbelly. It’s also free and available to play through your browser, like one of those Flash games from the ‘00s.
I’m a bit disappointed that Scythe Dev Team’s next project is completely a VR experience. It looks nice, but VR is for rich kids who used to own Sega Game Gears rather than Game Boys. I couldn’t hope to…
What was that?
They heard me! Run!
Love at First Squeak is free and available to play on your browser over on itch.io. Project Meganet is currently targeting PC and doesn’t have a set release window, but you can follow along with the ARG over on the Project Meganet site.

                              <span>License to bring in UK teams for six-year period
As Electronic Arts prepare for a life without the official FIFA branding, the publisher is reportedly already taking steps to ensure the future of its hugely lucrative footballing franchise, reaching out to the UK Premier League in order to secure licensing for its teams and players.
According to a report from Sky Sports, EA is in the process of negotiating with the Premier League to come to terms on a partnership for the upcoming EA Sports FC series — essentially the &quot;FIFA&quot; series sans official endorsement from the FIFA organization itself, which officially parted ways with Electronic Arts with the publishing of recent release FIFA 23, bringing an end to an almost 30-year partnership.
The EA x Premier League deal is, according to Sky Sports&#x27; sources, in its closing stages, and is said to have a worth of around £488 million (roughly $588 million USD). This figure, if correct, is believed to be around double the value of the previous deal between the two participants. The new contract will reportedly last for six years and will see EA retain its role as the lead partner of the Premier League, while also retaining its licensing for the use of 20 UK teams and their corresponding players.
As for FIFA itself, the group has previously suggested that it intends to launch its own football game franchise, and is currently seeking a developer for this as-yet-untitled new series. Ultimately, the long-running and incredibly popular &quot;FIFA&quot; experience lies with the talent of EA Sports, and while the transition period for EA Sports FC will be a little clunky, EA is expected to go above and beyond to ensure that its annual football releases remain a hugely lucrative part of its portfolio.

                              <span>The dead rise faster
Dead Island 2 is nearing a launch date, and it&#x27;s coming up faster than expected. Today, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios confirm that Dead Island 2 has gone gold, and will be launching a week earlier than previously determined.
This puts Dead Island 2 on April 21, 2023, rather than April 28. No specific reason was given in today&#x27;s announcement.
https://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1625147886643150852
This does push Dead Island 2 away from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had also locked in an April 28 date. Both had moved to the end of April following delays, but now Dead Island 2 is shifting gears once more, now sharing a week with the return of Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp.
Moving on up
It&#x27;s a bit of a surprise to see a date moving up in the world of video games. Delays are usually more common, as teams need a few extra weeks to polish, tighten the screws, and put the final touches on a multi-year project. Still, we do see it from time-to-time. The gnarly Scorn moved its date up by a week last year, Martial arts brawler Sifu also bumped its date up a bit before launch, too.
Still, for Dead Island 2, it&#x27;s a bit of a surprise. First revealed at E3 2014, the zombified sequel has shambled through the years, eventually arriving at Dambuster Studios. The team there has finally got it together and ready to move out the door though, and it may be heartening for fans to see them so ready to hit the gas on the Dead Island sequel.
We&#x27;ll find out whether Dead Island 2 and its motley crew of slayers can truly stick the landing a little bit earlier than expected. Dead Island 2 is now slated to launch on April 21, 2023 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

                              <span>New content incoming?
Over on the game sales spoiler website, better known as The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea, there appears to be word of a brand new edition of Sega&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog compilation, Sonic Origins, which first launched on PC and consoles back in June 2022.
The Korean ratings board has released a new listing for the as-yet-unannounced Sonic Origins Plus, which applied for registration back in late December 2022, before receiving approval in January of this year. The title, much like previous release Sonic Mania Plus, is expected to feature the original Sonic Origins compendium along with currently unspecified new content. Back in 2018, Sonic Mania Plus added two additional characters — Mighty the Armadillo &amp; Ray the Flying Squirrel — along with expanded multiplayer options and a brand-new mode.

Sonic Origins, released in part to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 30th anniversary, is a compendium of the first four titles in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The release includes Sega Mega Drive classics Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic CD, and Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles. In addition, the title features an array of new features including Mirror Mode, Anniversary Mode, and a chronological &quot;story&quot; campaign, that sees the player run through all of the titles as a single adventure, smoothly transitioning from title to title.
Sonic Origins is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. But if you&#x27;re on the fence about picking it up, you may wish to wait for additional news on this supposed re-release.

When we last checked in with Wild Hearts, I was pleased at how unique the game world was, and how it differentiated itself from the rest of the hunting genre. Four months later with the final build in my hands and the launch swiftly approaching, I feel roughly the same.

For me, the main draw of Wild Hearts is the setting. Taking place in the constantly changing and mysterious land of Azuma, it feels like pretty much anything can happen. An ice wolf can drop by and change the arena into an arctic setting. A creature can breathe fire and wreck havoc in an idyllic forest. Of course most of these sequences are scripted and deal with the introduction of big bosses (the subje…</span>

                              <span>Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it&#x27;s actually pretty cool. 
You can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. 


The website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:
In my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I&#x27;m not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. 
The Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.</span>

The news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it&#x27;s essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars&#x27; blast radius. 
You asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it&#x27;s coming out a week early.

But today, the game’s official Twitter announced the zombie slasher had gone gold and would be arriving a week early on April 21st, breaking the decade-long tradition of delay-related news.

This makes it a good opportunity to pick up (often barely) used gear, like headsets, external drives, mice and keyboards, especially higher-end stuff that would otherwise be out of reach.

                              <span>I&#x27;m such a sucker for cartoony animation in games. I’ll play anything that looks like it’s been lovingly hand-drawn and bonus points if the animation is deece. Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.

                              <span>Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it&#x27;s a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where&#x27;s the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?
These games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we&#x27;re used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.

Blizzard had already announced that this battle pass would have in-game currency for the first time, allowing players to buy their choice of cosmetics, rather than just the passes’ selection of skins and souvenirs. But fans on Reddit have accused Blizzard of deliberately misleading players with these rewards.

The bundle is a collection of 69 games, music, zines, and other creative oddities of the magical variety. Everything has been made by LGBTQ+ creators and all the proceeds will be split between the featured teams. So far, the bundle has passed a whopping $90,000 (or £74,000) in sales, with over a week left to go.

                              <span>Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.
Match-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don&#x27;t have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don&#x27;t like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin&#x27;s bedroom, or whatever. It&#x27;s the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I&#x27;ve been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it&#x27;ll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.

                              <span>When I say that Blood Bowl used to be a dead game, Cyanide’s Gautier Brésard is quick to correct me: “I would say that it was a community-managed game.” In fact, for the two decades that the tabletop Warhammer bloodsport was out of print, fans worked diligently to ensure it wasn’t out of mind - creating a ‘living rulebook’ that ran to six iterations.
“Here is what may be the final edition of Blood Bowl,” read the opening page of that community manual. “This is the rulebook designed to send Blood Bowl into a perpetual format. The Games Workshop is no longer interested in providing true support for this game.”

                              <span>Last July, Gabrielle Zevin&#x27;s Tomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow came out, a novel set in and around the games industry. The book follows three aspiring game developers from their time as kids to their careers in the industry, in part detailing the games they make along the way, and found itself on several best seller lists on its release. Over the weekend, veteran game dev Brenda Romero called out the novel for excluding her from the acknowledgments, despite the similarity, confirmed by the author elsewhere, between Romero’s board game Train and an in-book video game Solution.

Now that first game is being remade with new graphics and released outside of Japan for the first time. It&#x27;ll arrive on Steam this summer.

                              <span>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is over ten years old, and much of the game design that underpins it dates back to the original mod release in 2000.

I can&#x27;t get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.

It was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I&#x27;ve had a great time watching the first three so far.

The greatest of thanks to the park gardeners who plant those so we know that spring is coming, please, hold on just a little longer, enjoy these flowers and know that spring is coming.

                              <span>Episode five of HBO’s The Last of Us marks the midpoint of our nine-episode journey. That’s right, we’re halfway there, and Ellie and Joel are definitely living on a prayer. Look, I’m sorry for the bad Bon Jovi reference but man, this episode is The Last of Us at its most relentlessly bleak. I needed to do something…

                              <span>It seems I was too quick to judge HBO’s The Last of Us. While the first four episodes certainly kept my attention as well-written and delightfully-shot prestige television, I had been a little let down as the adaptive process of turning the game into a show has, so far, left out the recreation of specific, memorable…

Instead, two PrimeStreams-related lawsuits worth tens of millions in damages were quietly settled this week, despite what appeared to be a mountain of evidence. So what went wrong?

                              <span>2 Player Productions, the film crew behind the acclaimed Double Fine Adventure! series chronicling the making of Double Fine Productions’ Broken Age, has suddenly released a new documentary series following the development of Psychonauts 2. Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. 
The series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine&#x27;s studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2&#x27;s tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft&#x27;s acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we&#x27;re excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it.

Capturing the essence of an established fiction is tricky business, especially when translating into a new medium. It’s a big reason licensed games frequently miss the mark, sometimes failing to find the tone and nuance that made the original version shine. Avalanche Software navigates those challenges with a deft eye and an evident appreciation for the source books and films. Hogwarts Legacy…</span>

                              <span>In each issue, Game Informer prints questions that are submitted by readers via email and standard mail. We&#x27;d like to give our website readers the chance to make the magazine as well.
You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on March 7.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which developer do you always trust to deliver a great game and why?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

                              <span>Super Replay gets injected with a terrifying dose of dino-DNA as we tackle Capcom&#x27;s most underrated game, Dino Crisis! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we play the 1999 &quot;panic horror&quot; game from start to finish for two hours each week. Each episode will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the next day after airing. 
Episode 1 - Death Finds A Way
Episode 2 - In Defense of The Lost World
After the success of Resident Evil, Capcom followed it up with a spiritual successor called Dino Crisis. The title follows a similar blueprint to Resident Evil but ditches zombies in favor of blood-thirsty dinosaurs. The game stars Regina, a special ops soldier sent with a team to investigate an island research facility that has been taken over by these prehistoric lizards. Join host Marcus Stewart with Kyle Hilliard on the sticks as the pair get to the bottom of whatever the heck is happening on this island and blast these critters back to extinction.

                              <span>The makers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide have laid out their plans to improve the co-op shooter&#x27;s shopping and crafting systems. The gear system changes, due to arrive in the next patch, do sound like improvements to the current state of things. These plans do not sound better than entirely ending the tedious grinds of random rolls and making numbers bigger. Why improve when it would be better to remove?

                              <span>For three hours, Re:Call was high on my list of surprise recent indie hits. It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the &#x27;correct&#x27; solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. 
Then it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.

                              <span>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been bouncing between a lot of weighty games lately, but I&#x27;ve found a great diversion in The True Slime King, a simple three button platformer that recently left early access.

Speaking pedantically, this isn&#x27;t &quot;as simple as it gets&quot;, but you&#x27;ll get what I mean if I describe it that way anyway. You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way. These are far from my favourite genre, but I&#x27;ve played enough to realise I&#x27;m partial to a good one, and this is a great one.

                              <span>The Division 2 has enjoyed a long life since its 2019 release, but it seems like the looter shooter has finally tripped. Just last week, Ubisoft delayed the game’s imminent Season 11 launch due to localisation issues that had been “impacting the experience for many players.” But in the process of fixing that issue, Ubisoft had accidentally “brought down the build generation system,” meaning that no updates were possible until the system was rebuilt. At least they’re being honest.

                              <span>I imagine Industries Of Titan started out as an ambitious concept. A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.
All of those parts are present, and as a bonus it&#x27;s incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it&#x27;s tragic that its final design just doesn&#x27;t work at all.
Of all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You&#x27;re a &#x27;founder&#x27;, sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.

It&#x27;s meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.

                              <span>Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright&#x27;s new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.

                              <span>Recent multiplayer games seem to shut down almost weekly, but 16 years after release, good ole’ Team Fortress 2 is still chugging along with a new “full-on update-sized update” coming this summer. Valve’s hero shooter has been in maintenance mode for a few years, only receiving seasonal updates and patches to fix exploits and fight bots. So, judging by Valve’s “bleeding-edge communication” blog post, this will be the game’s first major content update in years.

There&#x27;s your chill little potion brewers that let you coo over a bubbling cauldron all nice and cosy like; there&#x27;s your darker, more supernatural witchy adventures that dig into the spookier side of the fae realm, and then you&#x27;ve got your lovely genre mash-ups that add spicy, magical seasoning to well-worn action tropes, like the excellent bullet-hell Metroid-like The Knight Witch I wrote about the other day. But if I thought that was pushing against my limits of gamepad dexterity, Contingent99&#x27;s 2018 roguelike Wizard Of Legend is on another level entirely.

                              <span>Katharine and I were lamenting earlier today that Square Enix seem inconsistent when it comes to releasing demos of their games on Steam. Forspoken&#x27;s demo only came to PC months after its console release, and Harvestella&#x27;s demo remains exclusive to Switch. Likewise, the Octopath Traveler 2 demo which was released on console yesterday was nowhere to be found on PC.

Uh, until today. It&#x27;s out on Steam now.

                              <span>Kingston&#x27;s 1TB DataTraveler Max USB-C flash drive is an unusual beastie, matching NVMe-SSD-grade speeds with a slim, portable flash drive form factor. This drive is capable of reads up to 1000MB/s, putting it alongside some of the best external SSDs, and it&#x27;s currently discounted at B&amp;H Photo Video to $80 for a 1TB size - not bad! 
Unfortunately this deal is only live for the next six hours, so I hope that you see this post in time!

They&#x27;re a series of dungeon crawling JRPGs in which you pilot a party of adventures through first-person, grid-based mazes and turn-based battles.

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew excitedly outlines a few big reveals from yesterday&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, including flying machines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and a collection of Game Boy games being released on Nintendo Switch yesterday alongside a surprise launch of Metroid Prime Remastered. Following news of a canceled single-player Titanfall game set in its shared universe with Apex Legends, the guys speculate about what happened to the project and share their ideas for what the game could&#x27;ve looked like. 
During The Playlist, we discuss the first hour of Octopath Traveller II, Goldeneye 007, Metroid Prime Remastered, and The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap.

Turns out Metroid Prime is still great and only improved by the visual upgrade and modernized contols.

                              <span>Nintendo has been slowly beefing up its library of games available to Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscribers. 
What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64, Ge…</span>

On the reasoning for the $69.99 price tag for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom:
On if this is the trend for Nintendo titles going forward:
Original Story (Published at 5:49 pm Central on February 8, 2023)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could very well be the most anticipated game of 2023 and is certainly one of the most exciting releases in the history of the Nintendo Switch. During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector&#x27;s Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
In its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.
We reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.</span>

A handful of new screens were also released for the game.

By now, Nintendo has brought a large chunk of its most popular and successful games of all time to Switch. Whether you&#x27;re talking the enhanced ports like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&#x27;s Fury and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD or the collection of emulated classics available through the Nintendo Switch Online subscription tiers, the Switch has rightfully earned its reputation as a place where you can experience both the newest titles from Nintendo, as well as many of its greatest hits. The latest title to time travel to Nintendo&#x27;s modern juggernaut system is Kirby&#x27;s Return to Dream Land, a 2011 Wii title from HAL Laboratory.

                              <span>Professor Layton is making a comeback in a new adventure for Switch. Called Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, the next chapter in his saga will arrive at a yet-to-be-specified date.
A brief teaser trailer shows the professor trotting through an industrial backdrop. We don&#x27;t know what mystery he&#x27;ll unravel or which allies will lend a hand, but it&#x27;s nice to see the good gentleman back. 


Professor Layton&#x27;s last title to star him was 2014&#x27;s The Azaran Legacy. In 2017, a spin-off starring Layton&#x27;s daughter called Layton&#x27;s Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires&#x27; Conspiracy was released for 3DS and was ported to Switch in 2019.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo announced a new Samba de Amigo game today during its most recent Direct live stream. Samba de Amigo: Party Central will be released this summer.
Party Central will feature 40 songs &quot;from across the world’s most popular music genres.&quot; Players use the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con controllers in rhythm with the beat. The game will also have local and online competitive multiplayer and party modes. 
You can check out the reveal trailer below:


Samba de Amigo: Party Central is actually a sequel to the first Samba de Amigo, developed by Sonic Team and first released on the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. It&#x27;s since been ported to the Wii (though it wasn&#x27;t very good) and had a long life in arcades.</span>

                              <span>During today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct presentation, we saw plenty of new footage of one of the most anticipated games of 2023, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While you can read all about that right here, we also got some news surrounding some additional ways fans can celebrate the launch of the follow-up to 2017&#x27;s Breath of the Wild.
First up, Nintendo revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Collector&#x27;s Edition. This bundle features the physical version of the game, an artbook with concept art, a steelbook case, an Iconart steel poster, and a set of four pin badges. This Collector&#x27;s Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.

Additionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link&#x27;s paraglider.
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.</span>

Alongside the trailer, however, Nintendo also released a new batch of official screenshots which features a collection of alternate paragliders alongside other details.

Still going by her birth name of Cereza, our hero is still a witch-in-training so she won&#x27;t be executing flash combos or summoning a litany of demons. Instead, Bayonetta Origins plays more like an adventure game. Along the way, she&#x27;ll befriend the demon Cheshire who handles all of the fighting. Cerezea lends a hand by magically binding enemies in place using her magic. Outside of combat, the pair combine their powers to overcome platforming obstacles. 


Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon comes to Switch on March 17.</span>

You&#x27;re going to immediately jump past this paragraph to the trailer below, so here are the quick bits you need to know: there&#x27;s rail grinding akin to Sonic and Splatoon, a new homing arrow, a big, dumb goofy car Link can drive and a new hoverboard, and all around the game continues to look great.

While we&#x27;re at it, here&#x27;s a whole host of new screenshots.

                              <span>DNS-resolver Quad9 continues to fight back against Sony Music&#x27;s demands for pirate site blocking measures to be deployed at the DNS level. The non-profit foundation argues that blocking injunctions shouldn&#x27;t apply to DNS resolvers as that would create a chilling effect on the free and open Internet. Quad9&#x27;s defense is supported by an expert report from  Prof. Dr. Ruth Janal.

Michael Barone worked at Carrasquillo&#x27;s pirate IPTV service Gears TV, initially in a customer service role and later as an administrator. Compared to Carrasquillo, Barone played a relatively minor role, but was still important to the platform&#x27;s operations.

                              <span>The Adata XPG SX8200 Pro was one of the best value NVMe SSDs when it launched in 2019 - and indeed, we have the RPS review from erstwhile hardware editor Katharine to prove it. Nowadays, PCIe 4.0 drives are becoming more common and PCIe 5.0 is on the horizon, but the SX8200 Pro - in a newer 2TB size - is still an awesome value for the performance on offer. It&#x27;s down to £117 at TechNextDay when you use code TND-10, a healthy £35 below the next-lowest price at CCL.

                              <span>Intel&#x27;s Arc graphics cards debuted to surprisingly warm reviews late last year, including over at Digital Foundry where I endorsed them as a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; that were &quot;already cards worth buying&quot; thanks to better-than-expected performance in modern titles. Six months of patches and performance improvements later, and these GPUs look even better - especially as neither AMD or Nvidia has launched mainstream desktop graphics cards from their most recent generation. 
 Today, the cheaper of the two cards, the Arc A750, is available for £250 plus shipping at Overclockers UK, a steep £80 reduction from their £330 launch price.

Not so, it turns out. The target specs have been released today and they&#x27;re relatively modest at both the low and high end.

It was confirmed last night during the surprisingly PC-relevant Nintendo Direct. A remaster will come to Steam this summer.

I like the colourful pixel art, the classic fantasy enemy archetypes, how spell cards feel super punchy when activated, and I love love love the magical, fluffy wizard rabbit. 
Called The Explorer, this rabbit is not only super cute - his little brown booties are adorable, as is his helmet which has holes so his massive fluffy ears can poke through - but a bonafide badass in magic casting. This rabbit can majorly throw down.

                              <span>It’s been almost 30 years since the management RTS The Settlers was first released. The series is still going strong at Ubisoft, but its original creator Volker Wertich is returning to the genre with Pioneers Of Pagonia, a similar city-building sim. The game is currently in development at indie studio Envision Entertainment and it’ll be entering early access on Steam by the end of this year.

                              <span>What a week its been! Not a great one if you like zany battle royales, as it turns out. This week on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast we discuss the recent sunetting of Rumbleverse and Knockout City, and how long is a good run for games anyway? But in happier and more ridiculous news, we also get to talk about how massively popular Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s steam release has been. Good ol&#x27; Dwarf Fortress. Plus: the Dreadwolf is leeeeeaaakiiiiing.
Nate&#x27;s mini-game this week is offering us both dark bargains (I think I did pretty well out of mine), and in a Good Day To Ware Hard James explains why the graphics card market is broken, with a cowboy metaphor. This is a thing now.

                              <span>A lot (most) of the magic games we&#x27;re highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It&#x27;s nice that witches have changed in our minds to &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]&quot;, when they used to be &quot;unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil&quot;.
There&#x27;s still room for witches with some threat to &#x27;em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It&#x27;s a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. &quot;In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,&quot; solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. &quot;During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one&#x27;s home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.&quot;

                              <span>We’ve all been busy here at RPS picking out our favourite demos in this spring’s Steam Next Fest. Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.
I thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it&#x27;s actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain&#x27;s Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.

That was a mistake, since their newest story-focused adventure Harmony: The Fall Of Reverie looks amazing. Best of all, it’s coming to PC and consoles this June.

Finally, there’s a high-end, DLSS 3-capable, Ada Lovelace architecture-based graphics card that doesn’t cost four figures.

While overall the Threadripper 3990X performance has evolved nicely under Linux since 2020, when it came to the video encoding tests in particular they performed worse overall. As I had raised in that earlier article and now elaborated with some follow-up tests, that regression is driven by the default &quot;schedutil&quot; frequency scaling governor used by default.</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has been very robust in its support of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, regularly bringing out new content for enthusiastic racers over the last year to keep the experience fresh. That trend continues with the upcoming Booster Course Pass Wave 4, which is targeting a release later this spring.
While we don’t have all the details, today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a look at the new course set on Yoshi’s Island, which looks just as whimsical and fun as that locale ever has. We also learned that Birdo is joining the roster of available racers – the one-time Mario foe first appeared in a Mario Kart game with Double Dash, and so this appearance is a return to the road.
Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service are able to access the new Booster Course Pass Wave 4 for no additional cost, but the pass is also available for separate purchase.</span>

                              <span>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp will be released on April 21, as announced today during the most recent Nintendo Direct live stream. 
Re-Boot Camp has had an uphill battle hitting any release date. Originally announced for a release on December 3, 2021, in October of that year, it was pushed to spring 2022. And then, well, that didn&#x27;t happen. In March 2022, Nintendo announced an indefinite delay &quot;in light of recent world events,&quot; perhaps referencing the war in Ukraine, which had just broken out at that time. 
Check out a trailer below.


Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a remake of the Game Boy Advance games Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. It&#x27;s being developed by WayForward, known for its work on the Shantae series.</span>

                              <span>Today’s Nintendo Direct gave us a new look at Sabotage Studio’s Sea of Stars. This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. 
Sea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
The new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.
Sea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.
The game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.
Check out the new trailer below.</span>

The trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.
The trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.</span>

The news comes by way of today&#x27;s Nintendo Direct. The cult favorite mystery game has been remastered in HD, and presumably, the gameplay has been reworked, given it was developed for the dual-screened DS. The Capcom-developed adventure game follows Sissel, who passes away under mysterious circumstances. It&#x27;s up to his ghost to figure out how he died by way of solving puzzles.

                              <span>Nintendo leveraged today’s Nintendo Direct as a chance to provide a new glimpse at Pikmin 4. Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.
We see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.
Nintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.</span>

It will allow players to hang out in Inkopolis from the original Splatoon game, and even meet and interact with characters from the original game, like the Squid Sisters, who will perform during Splat Fests.
No date or details were offered for the second wave, but it showed a Squid Kid in what appeared to be a snow-covered city. It also seems to have a more melancholy, sad tone. The second wave will be called Side Dish.


The Splatoon 3 expansion pass will be available to pre-purchase today.</span>

Those were the words of Capcom&#x27;s Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game&#x27;s magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game&#x27;s development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team&#x27;s approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. 
Ampo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil. Their combined credits span the original 1996 game to titles such as Res…</span>

                              <span>Ever since the first bundle arrived in 2014, The Jackbox Party Pack has been a staple in many households when friends and family come over. The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.
Like its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don&#x27;t know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
On top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.
The Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken players still exploring Athia or those hoping to jump in the future should be happy to know that developer Luminous Productions has announced an impending patch to make the adventure smoother across the board. 
In a statement by game director Takeshi Aramaki, the update will improve Forspoken’s graphics, performance, and playability while also adding “general updates” and fixes to both the PS5 and PC versions. There&#x27;s no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. 
“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
Forspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken&#x27;s story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I&#x27;m eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.</span>

                              <span>To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn&#x27;t detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.
This new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.
Perhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don&#x27;t already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.
You can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.


Cities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.</span>

At least in theory, another $16 million opportunity awaits.

It&#x27;s a chill, citybuilding puzzle game from the devs behind the altogether more violent Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and it&#x27;s all about building tiny little villages on top of rocky outcrops. Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It&#x27;s very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.

February’s Game Pass picks kick off tomorrow with the online action-RPG SD Gundam Battle Alliance, and EA’s Madden NFL 23 - which corrupted a number of players’ saves last month.

                              <span>Bullet hell shooters have never been one of my fortes in games. There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It&#x27;s a fantastic little game, and I&#x27;m only sorry we didn&#x27;t cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.

                              <span>Apex Legends is going to look a little different in a week&#x27;s time. Respawn have broken the mould a little bit with Apex Legends Revelry and the game&#x27;s four year anniversary - instead of adding a new Legend as usual, they&#x27;ve spent their time elsewhere to bring a host of Legend meta and weapon meta changes, alongside the new Team Deathmatch game mode and improving player onboarding that we reported on earlier in the week.
Apex Legends Season 16 is going to break a surprising number of targeted adjustments to various different guns, Legends, and abilities. And all that on top of the entirely revamped Legend class system, which gives every Legend a brand new perk (or in some cases two!) to play with. Read on for a full list of all the major changes that are coming to Legends and weapons with Apex Legends Revelry.

                              <span>As part of Steam Next Fest, I gave pixel-art, sidescrolling fantasy RPG Greedventory a go. It takes your mouse and turns it into a sword, or a shield, or an arm that&#x27;s capable of swatting away an explosive potion. It may be like something you, dear reader, have played in the past, but me? Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that&#x27;s a lie. If anything, it&#x27;s the first fantasy RPG that&#x27;s made use of my latent - and highly dubious - CS:GO skills and brought to mind a rhythm game called Osu! I am very impressed indeed.

                              <span>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have released their provisional findings on Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, laying out their concerns with the $69 billion deal. The CMA say the buyout “could result in higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation for UK gamers.” Since these concerns are provisional, both parties will have a chance to respond before the CMA makes its final decision on April 26th. Both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard believe the deal will encourage competition in the gaming space, rather than hinder it.

The Chaos Update brings a new challenge stage, two relics, and more features to the bullet-hell indie, but some fans are convinced the 1.3 update is actually an homage to Sonic The Hedgehog.

                              <span>It doesn’t have a demo or even a release date yet, but I am loving the look of Reka. It’s a 19th-century witch sim being made by Emberstorm Entertainment, where you play as a traveling witch whose chosen mode of transportation is the legendary chicken-legged Baba Yaga house, which is the coolest thing ever.

Details on Reka are still super light, and the Steam page mentions a release year of 2024, but I’ve been following Emberstorm’s Twitter intently, looking at all the cool gifs for Reka and the house looks incredible! For one, it’s huge. It towers above the forest trees and looks like it could easily stomp unwanted visitors to death. When the young witch approaches the towering beast, it bends is legs to sit down, almost burring itself in the earth for her access to the house on top.

Jedná se o shellový skript ESXiArgs-Recover, který je možné stáhnout na GitHubu. Na většině napadených serverů nedošlo k zašifrování virtuálních disků, ale jen konfiguračních souborů. Proto je možné pomocí skriptu jednoduše znovu vytvořit konfiguraci podle metadat a službu obnovit.</span>

Patch 50.06, released today, has added Arena Mode into the Steam version. Arena is a sandbox mode where you can spawn any of Dwarf Fortress&#x27;s various creatures, kit them out with gear, set special conditions, and then watch them battle it out. It is great.

Sonic Colours: Ultimate upscaled the graphics and added a new mode when it released on console in 2021, but seemed to also add new bugs in the process. 

As of today, Sonic Colours: Ultimate is available via Steam after a period of Epic exclusivity.

Oh, what&#x27;s this hiding down the back of the sofa? Why, it&#x27;s Blade And Sorcery, a VR game about hacking people to death in a virtual environment. How fortunate!

                              <span>Space management sim The Last Starship has moved early access plans forward from a hazy Spring release to next week on February 15th. Coming from Prison Architect’s devs, Last Starship has you build and customise your own fleet of spacecraft before taking them on various missions. If you want to try this spaceship builder now, there’s a free demo available on Steam as part of Steam’s Next Fest.

                              <span>You know, I always figured I’d be great at making potions. As a kid, I was obsessed with pulling things out of cupboards and combining them into a bowl. Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. 


As I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn&#x27;t posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.

It seems I wasn’t alone, as over 350 fans have collaborated on Celeste Strawberry Jam, the “largest collaborative project in Celeste history.” The mega-mod is adding 111 stages, five difficulty modes, and over 8 hours of original music on February 17th.

It&#x27;s down from £196 to £157, thanks to a 20% off voucher you tick on the product page at Amazon UK, and well worth picking up for that price - especially as the drive comes with a heatsink attached.

                              <span>Last week, I finished the free Tomb Raider DLC for PowerWash Simulator, in which you pressure-blast scum off Lara Croft&#x27;s ancestral home. It&#x27;s a great DLC, not just because it has loads of nods to the older Tomb Raider games, but also because if you&#x27;re just in it for the powerwashing, you&#x27;ve got some lovely levels to clean, with nooks and crannies and satisfying walls to scour. My favourite thing about it, however, is that it kind of canonically confirms Lara is an ass.

                              <span>We’ve seen Austin Powers take a stab at running the Normandy, but the 60s spy is probably too old school to be fighting Reapers in the year 2183. The head of the Normandy requires a modern managerial style, someone with the diplomatic skills necessary to bring the galaxy together. So, obviously, the natural choice to replace Commander Shepard is… Michael Scott? Someone made a video editing The Office’s nutty boss into scenes from the Mass Effect trilogy, and the results are hilarious.

Namely - a complete rework of the Legend classes and perks system; a new top-tier burst Assault Rifle; a rotating playlist of limited time modes, including the new Team Deathmatch mode; improved onboarding for new players; and much more.
Read more about all the major changes coming with Apex Legends Revelry on Tuesday 14th February below, and join me as I aggressively chew the walls in anticipation of the five new character classes that are about to shake up the Legend meta.

                              <span>Although my favourite type of witch is a spooky old crone, who cackles at the top of her lungs and lives in a swamp crunching rat bones and squeezing crow blood into her cauldron, the laid-back cottagecore witch is a close second. What&#x27;s not to love? Living in a cute little thatched roof house, tending to your garden, baking bread, sipping magical teas, reading old tomes on the front porch - absolute bliss.
Witchy Life Story is all about this lifestyle. It’s a fluffy, cosy visual novel where you play as a mischievous witch who is sent to live in a new town called Flora to prove themselves after royally flubbing their training. The town is preparing for a festival and, as the newly appointed town witch, you need to pull your weight by brewing potions, giving tarot readings, and even leading a guided meditation session or two.

                              <span>Darkest Dungeon 2 has been in early access since 2021, and it’s finally taking the roadtrip to a full 1.0 PC release on May 8th. We originally thought the nail-biting roguelike would see a 1.0 release this month, but developer Red Hook haven&#x27;t left us empty-handed. Darkest Dungeon 2 currently has a demo available on Steam and the Epic Games Store until the end of Steam Next Fest on February 13th. Red Hook say the demo will feature the four starting heroes as you take them around one full region and explore either the Sprawl (city) or the Foeter (farms.)

                              <span>Some of my favourite games involve visiting a fantastical town, befriending the residents, discovering their stories, and trading with them. Too often those same games also have too-difficult turn-based murderfests in-between, though. Here comes Townseek to fix that. It&#x27;s an adorable and &quot;relaxing&quot; exploration-trading game in which you pilot an airship, customise your balloon, and visit eg. some sort of bee kingdom, as per the screenshot above.

Deliver Us Mars follows in the footsteps of hidden gem Deliver Us The Moon, a game with enjoyable puzzle-solving and storytelling that mostly overcame its technical and presentational shortcomings. The same is nearly true of this sequel set on the Red Planet, though its larger scope magnifies its problems. Thankfully, a captivating narrative does its best to keep this flawed mission on track.   
Despite being a direct sequel, you don’t need to play Deliver Us The Moon to grasp Mars’ plot. Earth has spiraled into an irreve…</span>

                              <span>A new Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow, February 8, at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. 
Tune in at 2 p.m. PST tomorrow, Feb. 8, for a #NintendoDirect livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mostly focused on #NintendoSwitch games launching in the first half of 2023.

February 7, 2023
The event runs for around 40 minutes and will highlight Switch games launching in the first half of 2023. In terms of notable first and third-party exclusives that we already know about, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon fall under that range. It’s plausible we’ll also see one last push for indies coming to Switch soon, such as Have a Nice Death, Ib, and Storyteller. 
Given that this is Nintendo, it&#x27;s always possible they&#x27;ll announce a big game out of nowhere that winds up launching soon after its reveal. What do you expect/hope to see in tomorrow&#x27;s Direct? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>Velan Studios, the developer behind Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit and Knockout City, has announced Hot Wheels: Rift Rally. This new mixed-reality racing game comes by way of a collaboration with toy maker Mattel, playing off the experience the studio accrued through past games.
Much like Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, Hot Wheels: Rift Rally comes with a physical remote-controlled car, as well as physical course-creation elements, allowing players to design their own tracks within their house and race using the device&#x27;s camera. The aptly named Chameleon physical RC car used for Hot Wheels: Rift Rally can digitally transform into more than 140 different vehicle variations, including iconic Hot Wheels vehicles like Twin Mill, Bone Shaker, Mach Speeder, and more.

                              <span>Hogwarts Legacy is prepping for release on February 10, but the provided review code allowed for a review embargo that was lifted earlier today. After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.
In that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix. For gamers familiar with the books or movies, it’s great fun to explore the massive cast…</span>

                              <span>After spending a couple of years coming together in early access, Darkest Dungeon II is ready to go 1.0 this May. Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.
Darkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.
Heroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. 
You can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store. To learn more, check out our feature on the game&#x27;s new hero, the Runaway and a list of its most challenging enemies thus far.</span>

                              <span>After its launch in October of last year, Overwatch 2 is ready to kick off its third season of content on February 7. This season delivers several facets of new content, including a new Antarctica Control map, Asian Mythology theme, and a Kiriko Mythic skin. On top of that, Blizzard announced some unexpected additions to its Overwatch offerings, including the first IP collaboration as well as a web-based game to coincide with Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Antarctica joins the map rotation in Season 3. While players are already familiar with Earth&#x27;s least-populated continent through Ecopoint: Antarctica, this map features unique locations, including an ice-breaker ship and an underground drilling station. The map allows players to take the high-ground or sneaky flank routes to reach their objectives.

                              <span>Last night&#x27;s Grammy awards ceremony was the first ever to include a category for the best score soundtrack for a video game, and last year&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla expansion, Dawn of Ragnarok, took home the win. 
More specifically, the DLC&#x27;s composer, Stephanie Economou, won the Grammy for her score in the game. Her other credits include Netflix&#x27;s Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked &quot;all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,&quot; thanking them for &quot;acknowledging and validating the power of game music.&quot; 


Variety also reports that prior to this year&#x27;s Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show&#x27;s score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012&#x27;s Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel&#x27;s Guardians of the Galaxy. 
Economou&#x27;s Grammy was awarded during the main show&#x27;s pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game&#x27;s name last night is any indication.

                              <span>Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)

                              <span>Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario&#x27;s appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong&#x27;s reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.
In this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser&#x27;s Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad&#x27;s wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.
The Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario&#x27;s video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.
To this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7. For more, check out our reaction to the last full trailer during a recent episode of All Things Nintendo.</span>

                              <span>The remake of Resident Evil 4 is Game Informer’s cover story for February, and as part of our ongoing features, we’re sharing extended footage of the game’s fifth chapter, set right after Leon meets Ashley.  
I, Marcus Stewart, and video editor Alex Van Aken played this chapter at Capcom’s headquarters for our cover story. You&#x27;ll get a great look at the section we played as well as our commentary for added context. The footage includes extended looks at the church and cemetery sequences, a demonstration of combat and exploration, capping off with a larger slice of the chaotic cabin battle with Luis Serra.

                              <span>Since the remake of Resident Evil 4 graces Game Informer’s cover this month, we thought it’d be fitting to revisit the game that kicked off Capcom’s remake craze: Resident Evil 2. 
Capcom renovated Resident Evil 2 from the ground up into a modernized third-person action game. Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit my personal Game of the Year for 2019 to see how it holds up while discussing my Resident Evil 4 cover story.

                              <span>The PC launch of The Last of Us Part I has been delayed by a few weeks. Instead of releasing on March 3, the game now arrives on March 28.
Naughty Dog wants more time to polish up the PC port, as stated in a message posted to Twitter that you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). 
The Last of Us Part I launched for PlayStation 5 last fall and serves as a ground-up remake of the 2013 title. It features improved graphics, reworked controls, improved enemy A.I., and a remade version of the Left Behind DLC chapter. The remake helped usher in the premiere of The Last of Us HBO series last month, which has been heavily watched and received heaps of praise thus far. The show’s second season has already been confirmed.

                              <span>Velan Studios has announced that it is shutting down its dodgeball multiplayer game, Knockout City, in June. 
The studio announced in February of last year that Knockout City was going free-to-play and saying goodbye to Electronic Arts, who originally published the game as an EA Originals title, to self-publish the game&#x27;s future content. That free-to-play launch happened last June with the start of Season 6 and now, Velan has announced that it will shut the game down in June of this year. More specifically, Knockout City will be shutdown on June 6. 


&quot;Today we are announcing that Season 9 will be Knockout City&#x27;s final season,&quot; Knockout City director Jeremy Russo writes in a blog post. &quot;Then, on the morning of June 6, 2023, over two years after our initial launch, all servers around the wo…</span>

                              <span>A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It&#x27;s time to prepare for a new release!
Our lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:
Soldier Boyz
GLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)
GLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)
Obsidian
Pink Panther: Passport to Peril
Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink
Driller/Space Station Oblivion
Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II
Besides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.
And since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.
As usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!
Speaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
Thank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!

                              <span>As part of this month&#x27;s cover story, we sat with Art Director Hirofumi Nakaoka to learn how Capcom designs old and new enemies in Resident Evil 4 (Remake). You&#x27;ll learn about scrapped redesigns for the iconic chainsaw villager, how normalcy breeds horror, and how Nakaoka and the team created a new cow-headed, hammer-wielding villager referred to as The Brute. And folks looking for new Resident Evil 4 gameplay have some new footage to dissect in this video interview.

ScummVM has made huge strides in Macromedia Director support. Many Director 3 games are now fully completable, and several Director 4 games are also now playable. 18 new games are officially supported, and we could use your help testing them. We also welcome reports of any other Director games which are fully playable or completable. To test these new games, please use the latest daily build of ScummVM. Any bugs or problems can be reported to the issue tracker.
Some highlights from the new list of games include:
Chop Suey by Theresa Duncan, an important classic of &quot;girl games&quot;.
Eastern Mind, the cult classic from artist Osamu Kato.
Ganbare! Inuchan, based on the comic by singer Kenso Kato, which was the first Director 4 game to be fully completable.
Over-Ring-Under, by the same developer as Alice: An Interactive Museum. ScummVM&#x27;s new support for CD audio in Director games lets players enjoy the soundtrack by Carl Stone.
The first five games by Japanese indie developer iTA-Choco Systems.
