On April 18th, The Crew Motorfest will arrive on Steam after several months available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft&#x27;s own launcher, providing a new venue to buy the third entry in the series. Or perhaps that should be &quot;rent&quot;.

                              <span>I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to &quot;a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it&#x27;s 1000 metres in extent&quot;. Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?


Still, I&#x27;m very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it&#x27;s the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based &quot;immersive experiences&quot; and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it&#x27;s a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it&#x27;s inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet &quot;secret cities&quot; given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn&#x27;t make the last bus out of town.

                              <span>Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it&#x27;s an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,&quot; says Levine. 


Judas, it terms out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness.

                              <span>If you’ve  read my duology on spending far too long queuing in Hitman, you’ll know I’ve a predilection for the virtual people watching of NPCs in games that have some sort of schedule system. &quot;It’s a wholesome pursuit of game design knowledge!&quot; I stammer, as the guards approach. &quot;It gives me a greater appreciation for the obscure details lurking in the hidden corners of virtual cities!&quot; I protest, as I’m clapped in chains after being caught staring through a blacksmiths window for four hours watching him eat the same heel of bread, rubbing my hands together and grinning manically. Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.
Alfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.

                              <span>While the PC release of Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition has effectively made my PS5 ownership pointless, I can’t stay mad at it. Besides being a sumptuous, endlessly satisfying sci-fi romp with one of the prettiest open worlds in gaming, it’s also a very respectable porting job, with stable performance that scales well on aged PC hardware all the way up to glistening 4K rigs.
There are some imperfections, but generally, this shouldn’t be a repeat of Horizon Zero Dawn’s need for a post-launch patch regimen. On all the hardware I’ve tested, Forbidden West looks good to go, especially when choosing the right settings can smooth out performance even more.

                              <span>Swashbuckling third-person action-RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is, amongst other things, a gentle homage to New Zealand, developer A44 Games&#x27;s country of origin. You do have to look for it, mind you. The game&#x27;s art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.
Main character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking &quot;blackpowder&quot; pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed &quot;Hosts&quot; that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor&#x27;s spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology.

                              <span>Troubled city building game Cities: Skylines 2 is getting a little less troubled, as new patch 1.1.0f1 adds various performance and bug fixes alongside the main event: much requested mod support and tools in the form a nifty editor. We got a first look at the new editor tools last October, which looks to simplify the process by combining what was previously several different separate editors into a single application. It was later available only to some closed beta testers, but is now released for everyone. Emphasis on everyone, actually, since the tool looks refreshingly approachable, even for those with basically no modding experience.

                              <span>Maintaining the thrum of a finely-tuned citybuilder has to be one of the most satisfying acts of video game plate-spinning around. Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that&#x27;s the good stuff right there. Of course, it&#x27;s not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it&#x27;s the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it&#x27;s just that they won&#x27;t ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.
Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of &#x27;relaxed&#x27; and &#x27;something more&#x27;. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you&#x27;re free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.

But this morning came a thunderous plot twist. Someone on team RPS was contacted by a verified source with first hand knowledge of Joel&#x27;s shady activities. The source has confirmed that APC-deliverer Joel isn&#x27;t anything but an imposter, a fake, a generous fraud. The Real Joel, it seems, isn&#x27;t so brazen with his actions.

                              <span>Palia, a cute-looking life sim MMO inspired by e.g. Stardew Valley, has been in beta since last year, but now it&#x27;s officially out on Steam, where many more people can download and play it. With this launch comes a pretty substantial update - Patch 0.178, full notes here - which adds a new questline and Temple to explore, new furniture, and a bunch of new spring flowers and trees to grow in your garden. There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under &#x27;Adjustments&#x27;. The patch notes say simply &quot;What does he want? Does he come in peace?&quot; which makes him sound way more sinister than I think he is, but as you can see from the screenshot, he isn&#x27;t not sinister.

For anyone currently gathered around the hill, searching the pockets of their N7 hoodies for more heavy objects to fling at me, however, here’s some good news: the as-yet unnamed Mass Effect 5  is in the capable hands of “trilogy vets”, according to project director Michael Gamble, via Le Epic Musk Zone (OP didn’t steal), formerly Twitter. The team heading up the space game franchise’s next entry comprises of veterans of the first three games in various leading roles, namely: Art Director, Game Director, Creative Director, and Executive Producer.

                              <span>Few studios manage to hook my attention quite like Vanillaware does. Each of Vanillaware’s games is singular and unique in its own way, but still carries the identifiable hallmarks of its developers’ art, thinking, and approach. So with Vanillaware returning to tactics in Unicorn Overlord, I knew I had to see how it fared.


Unicorn Overlord feels like it’s reaching into the past, but in a different manner than most. Rather than drawing on the tiles and turn-based tactics of Tactics Ogre, the inspiration of its sibling Ogre Battle is clear as day. It’s apparent throughout the tense real-time strategy, the carefully laid-out overworld map, and the tiny squads of units running headlong into each other before zooming down to the melee, resolving combat, and swooping back out overhead.

Actually, I say “her,” but Medusa isn’t one monster. Or rather, she exists in one spot (that I’ve found), and will respawn over time. That’s a good thing too, because you need to be careful to remove her head during the fight. Depending on your care, you could end up with a withered head or a preserved one.

While you fight Medusa in the introduction of Dragon’s Dogma 2, that isn’t where you get her head. Instead, you find her in southwest Battahl. There’s a wooded area, the Wyrmsblood Forest, which you can see even through an unrevealed map. You’re looking for a big patc…</span>

It&#x27;s no secret that Helldivers 2 has more than a few bugs. After the last patch, it felt as though Arrowhead Game Studios had fixed a few issues but added many more that caused complete crashes. The game has been pretty unstable, making for a very trying experience for some who played over the weekend. Unfortunately, there don&#x27;t appear to be any fixes for these issues this week, but at least arc weapons are working properly again.

Most often, you&#x27;ll encounter battles that are better suited for long-range events, while others mainly focus on brute force alone. Choosing which class works best isn&#x27;t easy, but the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 Warfarer Vocation makes this process much more manageable. 


Unlocking the Warfarer Vocation in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, explained


The Warfarer Vocation can be unlocked from Lamond, a character located at Volcanic Island Camp. Unfortunately, this area won&#x27;t be accessible until the game&#x27;s later stages during the quest A New Godsway. You must also obtain three bottles of Newt Liqueur for Lamond to get him on your side. He will reward the Warfarer Vocation when enough resources are provided. …</span>

                              <span>If you’ve ever gotten the feeling that your Baldur’s Gate 3 party needed a bloodthirsty little gremlin who just loves creating chaos and causing pain, then then Larian&#x27;s got the perfect familiar for you. The pesky BG3 Quasit summon, Shovel, is a delightful little oddball, and she can become a permanent fixture on your team. 


You can only recruit Shovel in Act 1; she&#x27;s available via the Scroll of Summon Quasit and tucked away in a coffin underground. Mechanically, Shovel is only as useful as the Find Familiar spell allows her to be, though her invisibility ability makes her moderately more useful than the vanilla Familiar options. So if you&#x27;re eager to add the summon to your ranks, here&#x27;s how to get Shovel in BG3, along with how to keep the little fiend on your team for good.

After a couple of years of work, that gem, Mars After Midnight, is finally here, and it feels like an essential entry in the Playdate catalog. 


Most, though not all, Playdate games take advantage of the system&#x27;s unique crank and control system. For me, a game just isn&#x27;t up to par without some sort of crank usage as they don&#x27;t make use of the platform&#x27;s defining trait — it doesn&#x27;t show me how the experience is better or more interesting on the little yellow machine.

Although you only need basic early-game materials to make it, initially unlocking the car is where the real challenge begins. Here&#x27;s how to build a Speeder in LEGO Fortnite.


How to unlock and build Speeder vehicle in LEGO Fortnite


Before building the Speeder, you must craft a power cell using 50 biomass and six glass at a crafting bench. Biomass is a resource from a compost bin, while glass requires smelting sand and Brightcore in a metal smelter. After collecting both materials, bring them to a crafting table to make your power cell.

Where to get Blast Powder in Lego Fortnite


There are two main ways to find Blast Powder in Lego Fortnite: you either find it randomly in treasure chests or obtain it as loot from certain enemies. The former is a pretty tricky way to find Blast Powder, as you are not guaranteed to find the material in every chest you look in. As such, it is an unreliable method. You’re better off looting it off of specific enemies in two areas around your world.

How to unlock vehicles in LEGO Fortnite

Unlocking cars in LEGO Fortnite requires crafting a power cell, which you make using six glass and 50 biomass. Once you create biomass in a compost bin and smelt glass using sand, you&#x27;ll find a power cell recipe to make in your crafting table. Upon making the power cell, you&#x27;ll find your vehicle recipes under Rugged Rollers in the build menu&#x27;s builds category.

                              <span>In the Lego Fortnite Mechanical Mayhem update, vehicles are the highlight of new content in the sandbox crafting game. However, it can be a little tricky figuring out how to power and fuel the vehicles to make them actually go. This is how to power cars in Lego Fortnite.


Step One: Craft 50 Biomass


You will need some Biomass to forge the power source needed for vehicles, the Power Cell. This step requires you to have a Recycler, and then add some specific resources to create the Biomass. Here are all the resources you can use to create Biomass:



Slurp Juice - 1 Biomass


Food - 1 Biomass


Bones - 2 Biomass



As you can see, Bones are the best source of Biomass making it the most efficient fuel source. Bones are easy to get and are obtained by killing any enemy including Wolves. The extra Biomass you get from using Bones over Slurp Juice and Food makes it the best way to get lots of Biomass by far. If you&#x27;re using just Bones, you will need 25 Bones to create the 50 Biomass required to power your vehicle.


Step Two: Craft 6 Glass


Next, head to a sandy desert biome and use a shovel to harvest some sand. It takes 2 Sand for each Glass you make, so for this specific goal you will need 12 Sand. Go to your Metal Smelter and you can craft 1 Glass using the following materials:



1 Brightcore


2 Sand



So with 6 Brightcore&#x27;s and 12 Sand you will make 6 Glass which is the second ingredient needed to forge your power source.





Step Three: Craft a Power Cell


Now it&#x27;s time to take your 50 Biomass and 6 Glass and head to a Crafting Bench. Using the two resources will craft a single Power Cell, which serves as the power source for your vehicles! Put the Power Cell in your vehicle&#x27;s Power Center and it will provide it the power it needs to operate!

                              <span>At last week’s Game Developers Conference, Larian CEO Swen Vincke dropped some big news. The studio will not be making any DLC for Baldur’s Gate 3, nor will it be continuing ahead with Baldur’s Gate 4. 


On the surface, the decision seems incomprehensible. Almost any other studio in the world would be doing anything and everything in its power to continue the incredible success of Baldur’s Gate 3. You don’t typically see studios pull a complete 180 after winning Game of the Year awards and the adoration of fans everywhere.


In a recent interview with IGN, Vincke expanded on his comments from GDC and laid out why, from his perspective, leaving Baldur’s Gate behind is the move. Vincke said that after the overwhelmingly positive reception of the game, Larian started working on DLC and ideas…</span>

Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 Hawker Specialization, explained


The Hawker specializes in selling items when your weight capacity reaches &#x27;Overencumbered&#x27; status. This skill is excellent for gold farming in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, especially for those on the go. However, you can&#x27;t choose the items you want to sell; the Pawn will select them. 


Since you don&#x27;t have control over the exchange, items like Roborants, extracts, and weapon enhancement materials can be sold. I tested this procedure to see what st…</span>

                              <span>Power cells in LEGO Fortnite are the key to fueling your vehicles and driving them around your world. Creating them requires two crucial resources, which are slightly complicated to find initially. Here&#x27;s how to get power cells in LEGO Fortnite.


How to craft Power Cell in LEGO Fortnite


Crafting a power cell in LEGO Fortnite requires collecting six glass and 50 biomass. You don&#x27;t need to upgrade your crafting bench to access the recipe as long as you have both of these resources on hand. Once you have glass and biomass, head into your crafting bench and select the menu where you find torches and gliders to craft your power cell.

If you don&#x27;t yet have glass or biomass, obtaining them is initially a complicated process. Getting glass requires farming sand in the Dry Valley desert biome and smelting it in a metal smelter. Biomass is an organic material you find by processing monster resources and food items in a Compost Bin. Be prepared to pour dozens of materials into the Compost Bin to get enough for this recipe.

Power cells fuel power centers on your vehicles in LEGO Fortnite. Without these, your car won&#x27;t function at all. To get the car to function, build your vehicle and its power center before opening it. Here, you&#x27;ll find slots for your power cells, which you&#x27;ll insert to power your car. As you drive around, you&#x27;ll slowly drain your power cells, which you&#x27;ll have to replace over time.

                              <span>Konami and Stunlock Studios have announced that the vampire survival game V Rising will be getting an update that crosses the game over with Castlevania. The Legacy of Castlevania update will be free and is coming on May 8. 


The update will bring Simon Belmont to the game, with the teaser trailer suggesting that you’ll be fighting against him, which makes sense since you play as a vampire. The press release also describes the Vampire Killer whip will be added as a new weapon, which makes less sense because it’s consecrated.


On top of all the free additions of Simon and the whip, there will also be a paid “Premium Pack” that includes themed castle parts.




I played V Rising closer to its initial Early Access release and really enjoyed it. There were some places it needed to improve and tighten, but this was probably a year ago and those things may have been both improved and tightened. That’s what Early Access is for, after all. It’s a crafting survival game like the many that are out there now but with an excellent focus on vampires. You build your castle, enthrall some followers, and make sure you’re well-fed.


One of the first things I thought of when creating my castle was how awesome it would be to make something like Dracula’s Castle from Castlevania with its impractical gothic towers.


Unfortunately, we only have the teaser trailer to go off of, which doesn’t show any of the added features in action. We’re just going to have to use our imaginations.


That is until the Legacy of Castlevania content pack arrives on May 8th. This is also when V Rising leaves Early Access on PC and will be released on PS5.

                              <span>In LEGO Fortnite, creating a power cell for cars requires obtaining dozens, potentially hundreds, of biomass. Making some is straightforward once you know what structures you need, but getting this much is another challenge. Here&#x27;s how to get biomass in LEGO Fortnite.


How to create Biomass in LEGO Fortnite


Making biomass in LEGO Fortnite requires building and breaking down items in a Compost Bin. Using food items and resources you collect from monsters, you&#x27;ll add them to your Compost Bin, wait for them to process, and obtain organic materials like soil, fertilizer, and biomass.

To begin, you must build your Compost Bin using the following materials:



Plank x5


Soil x2


Sand x1


Fertilizer x3



Once you build the bin, farm some hostile enemies or grow crops until you have food items and monster drops. My go-to item for the Compost Bin was bones, as you can easily find these by defeating skeletons at night. With your materials on hand, use them in the Composter Queue to begin processing. After a few minutes, your items will appear in the created compost section.

Depending on the items, you&#x27;ll obtain biomass, soil, or fertilizer. I reliably found all three by breaking down bones and other monster drops, but you can experiment with any organic materials you have on hand. Since composting takes time, getting extra soil and fertilizer from this can help you make more Compost Bins, which will hasten the process of obtaining biomass.


How to use Biomass in LEGO Fortnite


Biomass is a crucial resource for creating power cells, a fuel source for vehicles in LEGO Fortnite. Creating one power cell requires six glass and 50 biomass, making this an expensive recipe if you have multiple cars. You can make a power cell by visiting a crafting table and finding the recipe under the same category as torches and gliders.

How to get sand in Lego Fortnite


Before obtaining glass in Lego Fortnite, you&#x27;ll first need sand. This is the easy part of the process, as sand is found in quite a lot of places. You’ll want to either head to the Dry Valley (desert) biome in the world or to any of the beaches near large bodies of water. Once you find sand, equip a shovel and start digging up the materials.

                              <span>Being tarred in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is a huge issue that can spark a fiery demise. You&#x27;ll want to have the right potion to counter this debilitation. 


How to remove tarred debilitation in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2


If you&#x27;ve been tarred, it means your character is covered in oil. That&#x27;s because you can be inflamed if you&#x27;re attacked with a fire spell or arrow. To counter this debilitation, you&#x27;ll need a Wicking Remedy. 


Screenshots by Destructoid


In order to craft this vial of medicine, you&#x27;ll need two Cinnamon Barks. Similar to Hill Beech Bark, you&#x27;ll collect it from trees. The best spot I&#x27;ve found so far is northwest of Vernworth. Run around to the thicker trees in the area, and you should see a bulging section on the trunk. You can collect multiple Cinnamon Barks from one tree. That would be enough to make at least one Wicking Remedy. Who knows? Maybe your pawn will help find some for you too.


Once you get tarred, use the Wicking Remedy in your inventory to flush the oil out. The game explains that it &quot;has the curious effect of removing excess oils on the skin.&quot; It will take up 0.10kg of storage and can be sold for 70G each. 


Other medicines or potions you can make


While harvesting trees during the day, you can collect Hill Beech Bark. When combined, they create Parching Concoction, which cures the drenched debilitation. If you combine Dried Fruit and Morningtide (which is a pretty common pickup), you can make Fruit Roborant. It recovers a &quot;great deal of health,&quot; according to the game. 


Can Cinnamon Bark be used for something else?


Cinnamon Bark is also used to enhance certain equipment in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. You&#x27;ll need at least one of this resource to upgrade the Woodland Boots at any armory or blacksmith.

                              <span>The LEGO Fortnite network can sometimes hit a brick on the road as players run into issues with its connectivity. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a way to fix the LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error, here&#x27;s what you can do.  


LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error solution


Players can fix the LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error by trying the following methods:



Restart the game and system


Ensure that your internet connection is stable


Change the region in matchmaking temporarily and then set it back to the original location.


Check the Epic Games server.


Wait until the servers clear up.



The most common notifications users encounter are the LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error #1 and matchmaking error #3. To fix this, the game or system may just need a quick restart since many players have indicated this method&#x27;s success. However, that isn&#x27;t always the case. So, check your internet connection to see if it&#x27;s stable enough to run the game. While you&#x27;re at it, look at the Epic Games server to view LEGO Fortnite&#x27;s matchmaking status. It will showcase a green-colored &#x27;Operational&#x27; standing if everything is working. 


But if matchmaking continues to not work, you can tweak the settings to fix the LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error. Go to the Game Settings and change the Matchmaking Region to another area. Next, select &#x27;Apply&#x27; to save these specs. You should then adjust it back to its original location and save it once again.

Even though this change is temporary, it could fix LEGO Fortnite matchmaking error #1 and matchmaking error #3. Nevertheless, the issue may still pop up despite following the steps mentioned earlier. In this case, it&#x27;s best to wait it out until the servers clear up. High player counts tend to cause the problem, especially during a new update. I recommend following the LEGO Fortnite Twitter account to track upcoming events and bug updates.

                              <span>Dust off your warlock tanks; the next phase of Season of Discovery is coming to World of Warcraft Classic. On April 4, the MMO raises its level cap to 50, adds new runes, and perhaps most notably, The Sunken Temple becomes a 20-person raid. 


The Sunken Temple, also known as the Temple of Atal&#x27;Hakkar, is WoW Classic&#x27;s first 20-player raid dungeon, pitting you against eight bosses for the clear. Because this is the Season of Discovery, expect a handful of new epics as well as adjusted favorite drops. These will help supplement new skills and content in this remixed version of WoW Classic.


One of the biggest of Season of Discovery includes its latest rune update. Each class can discover six new, unique runes to infuse their gear with new abilities. Players can expect to find them while leveling from 40 to 50 rather than having to wait until the level cap to find them. New rune examples include things like Druids casting Barkskin on other players. This can be while in animal form, with none of the spell&#x27;s drawbacks. Another rune gives the Paladin&#x27;s Consecrate the ability to deal critical strike damage.

New Nightmare Incursion World Events also launch with Season of Discovery. Players will be able to access the Emerald Dream portals across the world. They can summon bosses from The Nightmare for experience and Emerald Warden reputation. These will be a great way for leveling players to get a boost.


For fans of PVP, each class will be receiving a new 6-piece armor set. Additionally, large changes are coming to the Blood Moon event. This event turns Stranglethorn Vale into a bloody free-for-all. Even your own faction-mates won&#x27;t be safe from your blades.


Other features coming in Phase 3 include profession updates, global experience buffs, dual talent specialization, and more. You can read about the finer details on Blizzard&#x27;s post.

Here come the Rebirth Island sweats.


Welcome back to prison




For the first time in a while, Warzone players will be able to drop into Rebirth Island on April 3. With the launch of Season 3 of Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, the beloved map is returning. A trailer revealed the details, which include a few changes, or at least that&#x27;s what everyone online seems to think. After Warzone Mobile launched with Rebirth Island recently, many players believed it to be a mater of time before the standard game received the same content.

How does Romance work in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2?


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s Romance takes shape when providing gifts or completing certain quests. However, not all Affinities produce romance options. It could also be tied to individual preferences they may have, ultimately staying within a friendly basis.

                              <span>You know him, you love him, and even if you think you don’t – you do. Prolific doesn’t even begin to describe Yuri Lowenthal’s voice acting career, as the actor has over 800 credits to his name across movies, TV shows, and video games. 


When Lowenthal is not voicing major superheroes and lovable main characters, he’s tackling all sorts of background characters in smaller franchises you may have heard of, like Mortal Kombat, Fallout, Mass Effect, and Final Fantasy. Most recently, he even confirmed his involvement in Helldivers 2, a performance, &quot;heavily inspired by Starship Troopers.&quot; 


I could write a novel-length piece about Lowenthal’s ridiculous career, but this little overview into just a smattering of his best roles will have to do.

This quest line consists of multiple steps (though not as many steps as Mr. Raccoon&#x27;s quest line), each with its own requirements to fulfill.  


Before you begin this quest line, you’ll need to have repaired the bus in order to get to the Desert, and it’s a good idea to gather the items you’ll need in order to complete it:



Battery Pack

Obtained by placing a Lightning Rod or Solar Panel anywhere on your farm, or purchased at the Traveling Cart for between 1,500 and 2,500 Gold.




Rainbow Shell

Foraged on the Beach during Summer or purchased at the Traveling Cart for between 900 and 1,500 Gold

                              <span>You’re faced with an option during the Tensions on the Highroad quest in Dragon’s Dogma 2. You can stick to the plan and help the guards transport Ser Augustin to Vernworth, or you can trust Raghnall and fight off the guards. Tough choice.


When you first meet Raghnall in Bakbattahl, he himself will warn you that you shouldn’t trust him. He explains that he’s a sellsword and will take the side of whoever pays him best. However, Simon, the guard, is a jerk, while Raghnall is a dashing rogue. So, is it a trick to teach you a lesson about falling for a false facade?


No, you should side with Raghnall. Let’s get into the details.

                              <span>The source code of Italian anti-piracy platform Piracy Shield appears to have been leaked online. Nine repositories claim to contain everything from the front end, data models, storage and filesystem, through to the platform&#x27;s API and internal documentation. Presented with a manifesto of sorts, the unknown leaker claims that Piracy Shield &quot;isn&#x27;t just a failed attempt to combat online piracy,&quot; it&#x27;s a &quot;dangerous gateway&quot; to censorship &quot;disguised as a solution to piracy.&quot;

While that has failed to emerge, live data from the Piracy Shield platform is now being made available via an unofficial third-party service. That has revealed yet more blocking blunders, this time involving Akamai IPs.

She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along. As she careens through space further and further away from the station, it is revealed that a much …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it&#x27;s no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.
Thirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.
The relevant section says, &quot;Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.&quot;
There&#x27;s really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there&#x27;s no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft&#x27;s private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.

Last week, The Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s beloved ruler made her solo Switch debut with Princess Peach: Showtime!, an impressive performance in an approachable production that gracefully leaps between genres and finally delivers a star vehicle for a woman that has spent too long out of the spotlight.
Our royal reviewer PJ O&#x27;Reilly came away most impressed by the princess&#x27; performance, awarding it an 8/10 in his review and saying that, despite some technical snags, it has &quot;creativity, style, and fun to spare,&quot; with &quot;Nintendo finally  everyone&#x27;s favourite imaginary princess the rollicking adventure she deserves.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;It was a big letdown.&quot;.
To the disappointment of many, including us, it was confirmed earlier this year that Free Radical Design, the developer behind the highly anticipated revival of TimeSplitters, would be closed down by Embracer Group and the game ultimately cancelled.
It was a dire end to what many had hoped would be a grand return to the shooter franchise that took the world by storm in the early &#x27;00s. For Steve Ellis, co-founder of Free Radical Design, the game&#x27;s cancellation and studio closure was seemingly enough to deter him from ever being involved in TimeSplitters ever again.

It&#x27;s been a minute since we highlighted a particularly impressive island from Animal Crossing. New Horizons, but we thought this one was worth it. We&#x27;ve seen many sublime efforts since the game launched back in March 2020, but the crossover appeal of mixing in another of video gaming&#x27;s great isles really tickled our nostalgia bone.
This particular example incorporates elements of Myst, the genre-defining environmental puzzle/adventure game that took over the world back in the &#x27;90s.

When My Time at Sandrock sprouted onto Switch in November 2023, it&#x27;s safe to say that it wasn&#x27;t in the best condition. Aside from playing things a little too safe, the farm sim was awash with dull graphics and performance issues, making it far from the cream of the crop.
Fortunately, in the time since launch, developer Pathea Games has released a handful of updates to get things running a little smoother. Today, another one has arrived, with the &#x27;New Year Better Me&#x27; free update bringing Sandrock up to ver. 1.2.2 in style.

After last week&#x27;s Splatoon 3 music shenanigans (in which Nintendo uploaded and removed one track only to quickly replace it with another), you might assume that there would be a short break before we heard any more tunes from the Splatlands. But you would be wrong! This is Splatoon that we&#x27;re talking about, and new music waits for no man.
So we arrive at today&#x27;s addition to the pantheon of squid songs, &#x27;Suffer No Fools&#x27;. This one sees Pearl and Marina of Off the Hook facing off against &#x27;Fire &amp; Ice&#x27; (aka Shiver and Frye from Deep Cut) in a hard-hitting, abuse-hurling rap battle. Okay, it&#x27;s not that hard-hitting, but for four ink-based beings, there&#x27;s plenty of fire in the booth.

Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection should have been a slam dunk. Take two of the most beloved Star Wars games ever made and their DLC, touch them up a bit, add modern multiplayer support, and release them. Easy money, right? You’d think so, but the reality is that Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection is a massive disappointment, largely thanks to a mountain of technical issues and server and connection problems when playing multiplayer.
First things first: Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection collects Pandemic Studios’ Star Wars: Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005), slaps them into a single package, and adds support for modern online multiplayer. It does exactly what it says on the box, but the problems with the Switch version start before you even launch it for the first time. These games, which ran on the PS2 and original Xbox and fit on DVDs that could only hold nine gigabytes of data, are now a whopping 33GB+, so you have to have a micro SD card to even download and play the game on a standard Switch or Switch Lite. From there, you’re taken to a launcher that lets you choose your Battlefront.

                              <span>Competition is good!
Since the Swich&#x27;s launch and subsequent success (139 million units sold, anyone?), a vast variety of technology manufacturers have dipped their toes into the handheld market, including the likes of Steam, Ayaneo, Lenovo, and Asus.
If recent rumours are to be believed, however, it seems like Microsoft might be wanting to get in on the action with its very own dedicated Xbox handheld.

IA&#x27;s appeal previously received support from authors and copyright scholars. The publishers, however, have some heavyweight backers too. New amicus briefs are signed by former U.S. politicians, former judges, and legal scholars. Industry groups such as the MPA and RIAA also rally behind the publishers.

Expected imminently, the blockade is Telegram&#x27;s punishment for not helping to identify IPTV pirates. Described as “necessary” and “proportional” by the judge, the order was made on behalf of rightsholders pursuing a private criminal prosecution.

Final Fantasy. Probably the most well-known RPG franchise in the world (besides Pokémon), Square Enix (formerly Square) has been churning out Final Fantasy titles for over 35 years. Beloved by millions, the franchise is still proving popular today on multiple different consoles.

We&#x27;ve had a Best Final Fantasy Games list for some time here, but we&#x27;ve only ever included the mainline entries in the series.

Developer and publisher Illfonic has revealed the year 2 roadmap for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed and it&#x27;s a reasonably well-equipped plan in terms of free content.
Of course, with the launch of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire in cinemas, the game is looking to captialise on the new movie&#x27;s buzz with some free themed content coming soon to Switch. No release date is currently set beyond a rather vague &#x27;Spring&#x27; window, but it hopefully shouldn&#x27;t be too far off.

                              <span>Gather &#x27;round, friends.
If you&#x27;re a fan of the Pokémon-inspired RPG Cassette Beasts on Switch but have been hankering for cassette-battling action with your friends, then you&#x27;re in luck.
During a 2024 Cassette Beasts Showcase, developer Bytten Studio confirmed that the game will be receiving a substantial update on 20th May, 2024 that will enable multiplayer for up to eight friends. You&#x27;ll be able to explore the world together, battle against one another, and customise the battling experience with your own set of rules.

South Park’s history with video games has been a mixed bag for the most part and the latest instalment, South Park: Snow Day!, had a lot to live up to following the critical success of Ubisoft’s The Stick of Truth and its sequel, The Fractured But Whole. A shift in genre and developer — Question LLC is at the helm here — has resulted in a co-op multiplayer action game that has some promising ideas but is ultimately let down by some significant performance issues (at least on Nintendo Switch) and an unsatisfying gameplay loop.
South Park: Snow Day takes place shortly after the events of The Fractured But Whole, focusing on the customisable New Kid protagonist as they interact with the source material’s eccentric cast of characters. The premise is a lot simpler this time around, however, with the plot focusing on the titular snow day that has made its way to South Park. Eric Cartman is obviously ecstatic about this – he doesn’t have to go to school and enlists the New Kid to participate in a series of Snow-based battles and other shenanigans.

Nintendo is back with yet another Switch eShop sale, offering some sweet savings to see in Spring in style.
The Blockbuster Sale begins today (25th March) and will be bringing discounts of up to 70% to over 1,000 eShop delights until 7th April. This one is available only for those with a European eShop account, we&#x27;re afraid, though we&#x27;re sure that it won&#x27;t be long before our friends across the pond get a batch of savings of their own.

We all know how easy it can be to lose ourselves in our Nintendo Switch from time to time. You might find yourself picking up something like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or the recently launched Balatro and have the genuine intention to only play for around 10 or 15 minutes. Suddenly, it&#x27;s 2am and your bladder is in dire need of some drainage. We&#x27;ve all been there.
For one Japanese police officer at the Tenri Police Station, however, time on the Switch has unfortunately meant that his attention to his role has suffered, leading to a bit of a slapped wrist and docked pay (via Japan News).

Last year we got our first DLC expansion to 2022&#x27;s brilliant beat-em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge. The Dimension Shellshock DLC was awesome, adding in a new roguelike Survival Mode, two new fighters and a host of fresh features besides.
We don&#x27;t want to mimic that one Kylo Ren meme too much, but this is a game that is always going to leave us wanting more. Fortunately, it sounds like the game&#x27;s development studio, Tribute Games, is up for it too (thanks, GoNintendo).

                              <span>It’s showtime for Peaches Peaches, Peaches Peaches Peaches.
As they often do for tentpole characters, Nintendo —at their flagship store at Rockefeller Center in New York City— held a special launch event for their leading lady, Princess Peach. Having recently (as of The Super Mario Bros. Movie) stepped out of Mario’s portly shadow and into the limelight—thanks partially to Jack Black’s hit song ‘Peaches’— Peach now stars in a game of her own, Princess Peach: Showtime!, which released on March 22, 2024.
Unlike many launch events held at Nintendo NY over the past few years for The Legend of Zelda and Kirby, the festivities for Princess Peach began on Friday, and ran all through the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, where attendees could play the game on the store’s giant widescreen, sample Kung-Fu Tea’s new Princess Peach variant, purchase any of the considerable amount of Peach-themed merch, get your photo taken with Peach herself (she deigned to appear in person and take photos with the common folk), and of course pick up a copy of the game and/or a pair of matching pink Joy-Cons.

A trailer for a new Sonic mobile game dubbed &#x27;Sonic Toys Party&#x27; has seemingly leaked and is currently being showcased by The Sonic Show on YouTube (update: the video has since been taken down via a copyright claim, but we&#x27;ve replaced it with an alternative from Sonic Station).
Not only does the game&#x27;s logo bear a strikingly similar resemblence to a certain Pixar-developed animated film franchise, it also borrows a few elements from the hugely successful multiplayer title Fall Guys by developer Mediatonic.

I sure didn’t! That was over three years ago during the heights of a worldwide pandemic, though, so I think we can forgive ourselves a little. Anyway, Ark: The Animated Series has now arrived out of the blue, dropping its first six episodes on streaming service Paramount+.

Into that debate has waded the CEO of graphics card giants Nvidia to drop a prediction that can only be described as searingly flammable: we’ll see games where everything seen on-screen is fully generated by AI, in real-time, within the next 10 years.

Except everyone also seems to dislike one specific part of Dragon’s Dogma 2: the fantasy sequel’s microtransactions. But that one dull spot has already been polished out by modders, who are offering more convenient (and less expensive) ways to pick up items that you’ll either need to potentially grind or cough up real money for.

They say they&#x27;re even now playing work-in-progress versions of the game, which was announced five years ago, and are having a jolly old time revisiting Tamriel. Alright for some.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It&#x27;s the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.
Millennia is perhaps the Civ-like that&#x27;s clung most tightly to the genre&#x27;s apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they&#x27;re clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t a particularly good student.

                              <span>Here’s one for all you connoisseurs of the horrific consequences of your own actions. Regicide-em-up visual novel Slay the Princess’ new update brings with it new dialogue and music, fleshing out the game with additional choices, expanded scenes, and orchestral renditions of some choice tracks. The new content takes the form of new animations and “more than 3,000 words of additional and restructured dialogue choices and conversations.” That is easily enough words to tell the Stanley Parable-esque narrator that you’re on to him and whatever mind games he’s playing, with enough left over for the other voices in your head to make you doubt your own morality with alarming frequency.

                              <span>One of my favourite things about Helldivers 2 is the fact it&#x27;s home to a human game master,  known as &quot;Joel&quot;, who controls the narrative. Joel&#x27;s been known to leave surprises, namely mechs before they officially launched a while back. And now he&#x27;s seemingly granted a group of lucky players the chance to ride about in an armoured truck outfitted with guns. Maybe, just maybe this signals their imminent release?

The work of Struct9 founder Matej Vanco, it hands you a distressingly unwieldy and roofless hovership and cuts you adrift in a vast ocean of malevolent mathematics.

                              <span>At first glance, this shadow-hopping top-downer looks like a nostalgic stealth game designed to evoke the boxy subterranean environments of the first Metal Gear Solid. But really it is a tough single-player fighting game with stealth bits attached. It is closer in design to kung-fu brawler Sifu than it is to any of Solid Snake&#x27;s various mischiefs. And while this mash-up of influences intrigues me, it can also feel like a layer cake of awkwardly clashing flavours. Like that very pretty but questionable cake, Raw Metal feels a little underbaked.

It&#x27;s a cute, deckbuilding strategy game where you&#x27;re a witch building up strength to take on some horrible void-y demon-y things. It has much higher stakes than Stacklands, but most importantly, you summon cat familiars in it, and they go &#x27;meow!&#x27;

                              <span>There’s a teaser image on the wall. We stare at it and we think that’s the whole multiplayer shooter set in the Control franchise. Then, Remedy sneak a second teaser image alongside some tantalising lore snippets into their latest investor report (Thanks, resetera!) Also there’s an air fryer that turns nuggets into miniature black holes, or something. I’m not sure because, honestly, I never learned to appreciate Control’s wonderful architecture and lore because the combat made me want to gnaw my fingers off. Good news, then, for everyone except me specifically. We’ve got a few more scraps of info about its (presumably) almost entirely combat focused spin-off title, currently known as ‘Condor’. 


“After the Hiss invasion, the Oldest House is under lockdown: a boiling pot of volatile and dangerous supernatural forces,” forewarns the infographic. “Trapped within is the last vestige of the Federal Bureau of Control who will need to take a stand and push back to regain control.” You can take shifts watching the full image in case it does anything untoward below.

Many of the pre-order and special edition bonus items players can get with the upcoming Dawntrail expansion are suspiciously FF9-themed, you see, but when pointing this out to PAX-goers, Yoshi-P said &quot;the reason is a secret&quot; for now, sparking fresh rumours about Square Enix&#x27;s supposed Final Fantasy IX remake/remaster.

                              <span>GTA 6 is facing development troubles, leaving leadership “nervous” that the hotly anticipated open world crime-athon could be “falling behind’ expected schedules. That’s according to Kotaku, who were told by an anonymous source that studio heads are “worried” that the game could miss 2025 completely and not see release until 2026. Kotaku were told that the studio is still “aiming” for a Spring 2025 release date, but sources feel Fall of the same year is more plausible. However, the title could be delayed until 2026 as a “fallback plan.”

He&#x27;s been writing here as a freelancer loads. He threw a rock through the treehouse window and were preparing to sacrifice him to appease Horace&#x27;s great coils, but the endless bear spake and instead commanded us to hire him, after a rigorous interview process. Say hello to Nic in his new and official capacity here on the site! My enthusiasm has woken me up again!

                              <span>Fantasy action-RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has had a tumultuous launch week: praised by reviewers, slated for its performance issues, and berated for its microtransactions, which appear to have been stealthily added after the game was sent to critics. Now begins the labour of patching the game. Capcom have released a few hints about forthcoming Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 updates. Their plans for the PC version include letting players acquire dwellings earlier on in the story, improving quality when DLSS super resolution is enabled, and adding the option to start a new game when save data already exists.

                              <span>Days Gone is that zombie x motorbike open world game (except they were at pains to point out that Freakers weren&#x27;t zombies) that Sony did for PS4 in 2019, and ported to PC in 2021 - both years after people were done with Sons Of Anarchy as a thing. As alluded to in The Maw this week, there hasn&#x27;t been much news out of Bend Studios since then, but they&#x27;re now hiring for a lead project manager for &quot;crafting our next high-profile AAA title.&quot; Another clue? The successful applicant must have experience &quot;with an emphasis on live operations&quot; and &quot;in leadership roles shipping AAA live service games&quot;. Hmmm.

I landed back in the UK from GDC on Saturday afternoon, and my brain and eyeballs still feel as though they&#x27;re being gently sautéed in a medicinal blend of oil and vinegar. The sun and sky bear down with a terrible, holy light and I can&#x27;t seem to conjure any warmth into my elbows. In the street outside, a small dog is barking. Soon, very soon, I will catch that dog, place it in a box and FedEx it to China.

                              <span>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of &quot;the greatest of all time&quot; inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we&#x27;re taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we&#x27;ll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you&#x27;ll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

                              <span>Last week, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 was released to critical acclaim followed by intense fan backlash. While the game itself is enjoyable to most, it launched with microtransactions that provide in-game currency, as well as a litany of technical issues for some players. Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the &quot;near future,&quot; but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.
In addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements. For starters, the Pawn Guild now sells a lot more &quot;Art of Metamorphosis&quot; items, which is how you can change the appearance of a character or pawn after they&#x27;ve already been created.

                              <span>Dawntrail, the fifth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is coming on July 2. The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  
The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. 
During PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: 
Collector’s Box ($155.00)

Dawntrail Special Art Box 
Expertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65&quot; x W 4.52&quot; x D 5.90&quot;/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)
Adventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53&quot; x 29.52&quot;/42cm x 75cm)
The Unending Journey Notebook (5.90&quot; x 4.33&quot;/15cm x 11cm)
Adventurer’s Pen Case (8.26&quot; x 9.44&quot;/21cm x 24cm)
Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)

In-game Item: Ark Mount 
In-game Item: Garnet Minion 
In-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon 
While the Digital Collector&#x27;s Edition and Collector&#x27;s Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector&#x27;s Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. 
Pre-orders for the standard and collector&#x27;s edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT. Doing so at certain retailers grants the bonus in-game items: Wind-up Zidane Minion and Azeyma&#x27;s Earrings.</span>

                              <span>Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn&#x27;t officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game&#x27;s opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.


Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, &quot;This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story.&quot;
Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January&#x27;s State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.
Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>

                              <span>As elements of the UK media continue to stomp on reality in exchange for piracy-related clicks, a new story doing the rounds has managed to reach a new low. Accompanied by the usual dire warnings, the stories claim that a new overseas anti-piracy system has Brits &quot;braced for a crackdown&quot; because it could &quot;stop Brits watching illegal streams for good.&quot; Perhaps the Premier League should buy this system right now? Yeah, about that.

                              <span>Acolyte of the Altar, the roguelike deckbuilder with a wasteland twist from developer Black Kite Games, hits PC via Steam on March 25. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch next week, Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer, which features plenty of deckbuilder action and another taste of this Magic: The Gathering and Shadow of the Colossus-inspired game. 
&quot;Journey through desolate wastelands and hunt down colossal Beasts to grow stronger and serve your chosen Patron deity,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. 
Check out the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Acolyte of the Altar continues to look great (and spooky), and we&#x27;re excited to try our hands at its unique style of deckbuilder. 
&quot;Beware,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;Beasts grow stronger during battle, allowing them to consume your creatures or counter your spells. Carve profane Gifts from these behemoths and grow stronger to serve your Patron. But serve them to what end?&quot;
That is the question players will answer when Acolyte of the Altar hits PC via Steam on March 25, 2024. If you&#x27;re interested, you can play a demo of the game on Steam right now. 
Here are some Acolyte of the Altar screenshots to enjoy in the meantime:

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Velan Studios, the team behind Knockout City, has announced it is entering a reorganization that will likely result in layoffs. 
In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio&#x27;s co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

                              <span>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of the year’s most anticipated games, and by most accounts, the experience lives up to the hype. The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.
In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

                              <span>Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game&#x27;s expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game&#x27;s story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. 



Are you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game&#x27;s writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After its gorgeous Steam Next Fest demo last month, tiny little house builder Summerhouse has now arrived on Steam in full, launching just a couple of weeks ago on March 8th. I&#x27;ve been having a swell time with this over the last few days, particularly as I noodle about in the other big backdrops that weren&#x27;t available in its earlier demo.  
But there&#x27;s been another Summerhouse development this week that has arguably delighted me even more. Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword &amp; Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they&#x27;ve seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let&#x27;s make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah?

Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.

                              <span>Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it&#x27;s also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year&#x27;s Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.

                              <span>Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn&#x27;t really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.
Passing By - A Tailwind Journey isn&#x27;t aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It&#x27;s the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you&#x27;re meant to go when they get around to it. It&#x27;s not a purely vibe-based game, but you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.

                              <span>Last time I checked, my pawn Bronco sat at 80 in the monthly leaderboard of the pawn global rankings. Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn&#x27;t quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn&#x27;t being picked up by adventurers as much as I&#x27;d like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I&#x27;m not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

                              <span>One of the neat things about massive Amazon sales, especially if you’re not keen on filling their coffers specifically, is that rival retailers often counter with big deals of their own. The best one I’ve seen during the current Amazon Spring sale is this Ebuyer offer on the excellent Crucial T500 SSD: the spacious 2TB model isn’t just cut down from £163 to £140, but it comes with a free Gamesplanet code for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. Result!

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 arrives on PC and consoles today, but despite high critical acclaim when reviews hit earlier this week, players on Steam have begun review-bombing Capcom&#x27;s high fantasy RPG after the appearance of some sudden and confusing microtransactions. These weren&#x27;t present in the press build of the game, and players are so up in arms about them that the game is currently sitting on a fat red &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; Steam rating based on over 11,000 reviews and counting.

The action-RPG&#x27;s developers announced last night that the closed beta planned to start on the 7th of June will now not. They think they could have something ready by then but it wouldn&#x27;t be up to their standards, so what&#x27;s the hurry?

Take this Ugreen Docking Station, a longtime member of our best Steam Deck accessories guide: Prime members can have one for 30% in the UK and 40% in the US. Gated as they are, these savings make Ugreen’s dock less than half the price of Valve’s official Steam Deck Docking Station, despite it providing a similarly healthy supply of ports and jacks.

Released in June 2023 for mobile and PC, Undawn had an allegedly huge budget, according to Reuters sources, but which only brought in under $300K last month, as estimated by research firm Appamgic. And on hearing this news everyone went: &quot;Sorry, what are you talking about?&quot;

                              <span>Last month, developers Jyamma announced Enotria: The Last Song, an Italian-inspired Soulslike where masks give you powers. It was originally due out on June 21st, but then FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree would also launch on the same day. Not ideal. So, Jyamma delayed Enotria&#x27;s release, and in an announcement at last night&#x27;s Future Games Show, we now know it&#x27;s launching in August. It has, however, dropped itself into another conundrum: Black Myth: Wukong, another hotly anticipated Soulslike, arrives a day earlier.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is, as a game per se, very good! It’s creative and intelligent and lets you fill other players’ worlds with recruitable humanoid versions of your pet cats. Still, a technical masterclass it is not. In my performance analysis, I touched on DD2 being particularly unplayable on the Steam Deck, suffering from sub-10fps framerates and a bunch of broken settings. Since that was based on pre-release code, I had quietly hoped that Capcom could pull something – anything – out of the bag to salvage handheld PC play in time for launch day, but now the time has come, I’ve checked again, and nope. This RPG adventure simply doesn’t work on the Steam Deck, and probably never will.

Whatever the intent, DoodStream&#x27;s operators are now being sued by Hollywood, Netflix, Amazon and Apple, who apparently identified them as long ago as last summer.

                              <span>Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.</span>

                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2023/08/11/36603f58/baldurs_gate_3_art_crop.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. &quot;We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that&#x27;s made to create DLCs or expansions,&quot; Vincke said. &quot;We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It&#x27;s not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it&#x27;s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.&quot;


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There&#x27;s no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there&#x27;s a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze&#x27;s in-development D&amp;D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft&#x27;s D&amp;D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since Balatro, the poker-inspired deckbuilding roguelite, was released, and it has taken the gaming world by storm. In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn&#x27;t share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…</span>

                              <span>Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we&#x27;re still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.</span>

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…</span>

                              <span>Mention Lionhead&#x27;s &#x27;05 management sim about running a film studio and someone will crash through the wall, Kool-Aid Man style, to say they really liked it and there should be a remake or a sequel. In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at &#x27;mostly negative&#x27; status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to The Movies. It&#x27;s launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

                              <span>In November last year, the Australian post-apocalyptic CRPG Broken Roads was abruptly delayed mere days before it was meant to come out. Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed &quot;additional polish time and QA manpower&quot; to test the &quot;thousands of permutations&quot; available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

                              <span>Welcome to the final part of Electric Nightmares, a short series about generative AI and games. So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI&#x27;s growing dominance.

                              <span>No James this week, but I am joined by Nate for this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast to discuss Ubisoft&#x27;s new NEO NPC prototype - an NPC you can have a stilted, weird conversation with using the power of AI! It&#x27;s fair to say we are quite partisan about this and do not want it, but we discuss why anyway. In counterpoint, we think World Of Warcraft&#x27;s new piratey battle royale game mode sounds pretty cool and good, actually?
Plus: I ask Nate to explain cool things that I&#x27;ve seen in Warhammer 40K: Darktide, and Nate tries to convince me to take a devil&#x27;s bargain where I have to play WOW for at least 12 hours a day, but I get a sort of increasing MDMA high while doing so.

                              <span>Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I&#x27;ve been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold&#x27;s assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than &#x27;feed the fish&#x27; and &#x27;talk to so and so&#x27;, all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it&#x27;s Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He&#x27;s a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he&#x27;s some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn&#x27;t help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone&#x27;s underlying frustration with him like it&#x27;s all water off a duck&#x27;s back. It doesn&#x27;t seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he&#x27;s too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant. After all, it&#x27;s not just Harold that&#x27;s being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn&#x27;t just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it&#x27;s also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.

                              <span>I usually know right away when I&#x27;m going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don&#x27;t always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it&#x27;s the sense that you&#x27;re making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you&#x27;ve been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn&#x27;t the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don&#x27;t figure it out in time, you&#x27;ll have to make a new character and try again. And if you&#x27;re an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you&#x27;ll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even do it without getting stabbed.

                              <span>Before a month of my life vanished into customising cards and rigging decks in Balatro, my desire to conquer dungeons by fixing gambling tools came from playing Slice &amp; Dice. First released in 2020, it&#x27;s a gauntlet of fantasy turn-based battles where most attacks, abilities, buffs, debuffs, and items are very cleverly handled by mapping them onto the faces of dice. Oh, you&#x27;re going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice &amp; Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while, but I&#x27;m finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I&#x27;m currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&amp;B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who&#x27;s a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It&#x27;s also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It&#x27;s a mixed bag, is what I&#x27;m saying.

                              <span>I’m not saying it’s some kind of electronic commerce conspiracy orchestrated by Big Graphics Card, but I’ve noticed that most of the best Amazon Spring sale deals on gaming monitors are for 4K screens. On the one hand, aww, because everyone likes a bargain 1440p-er. On the other, woo, because gaming-spec 4K monitors are usually some of the most financially devastating PC hardware pieces you can get. Anything that makes these super-sharp displays more affordable is, therefore, quite welcome. 160Hz, UHD visuals for £399? Sure, why not.

Riot co-founder Marc Merrill announced that the project has been &quot;reset&quot; and won&#x27;t appear for &quot;likely several years&quot;, with one of the main reasons being a &quot;need to do something that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre&quot;.

Powerful. May 9th is the day, so you have time to practise your touchtyping with Mavis Beacon. I really enjoyed playing Cryptmaster&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo, so I&#x27;m excited for the full game.

                              <span>It may have taken almost a month but Italian telecoms regulator AGCOM has finally admitted that Cloudflare was wrongfully blocked by its fledgling anti-piracy system, Piracy Shield. There was no apology for the journalists accused of reporting &#x27;fake news&#x27;, or an apology for Cloudflare after disrupting its business. Meanwhile, Cloudflare will draw attention to overblocking by urging customers affected by the blunder to file official complaints.

Nouveau nedávno připadlo podporu pro GSP, což bylo potřeba pro RTX 4000. Nova však bude patrně vhodnější volba pro nové karty.</span>

In my review for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter I wrote about how it was a game I created excuses for myself to keep playing after seeing credits writing, “I didn’t do it out of necessity; I did it because I wanted to stay in Hyper Light Drifter’s world for as long as possible.” I love the color, style, music, and overall vibe of that game, which is why I was so excited to finally go hands-on with its not-quite-a-sequel, Breaker, and finally have an excuse to exist in that world again.


“It’s not a sequel – it is just in the world of Hyper Light. It will have common threads, themes, and shared components,” director Alx Preston says. “If you played Drifter you will see reappearin…</span>

                              <span>Hyper Light Breaker is not a sequel to Hyper Light Drifter in the traditional sense, but it does take place in the same world, which is all we needed to hear to be excited. While this isn&#x27;t gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

                              <span>Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other&#x27;s methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance&#x27;s story consultant, Marc Bernardin.</span>

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Update 1.6 launched on March 19 and brought a long laundry list of bug fixes, changes, and new content to the game. It’s enough to get old and new players to dive in, years after its release.

                              <span>We’ve known that a Marvel game from former Uncharted writer-director Amy Hennig has been in the works for years, learning in 2022 that it will focus on Captain America and Black Panther during World War 2. Thanks to a proper reveal during today’s State of Unreal event, we now know that it’ll be called Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra and we’ll be able to play it sometime in 2025.

                              <span>This article&#x27;s headline is the characterisation of Everdeep Aurora given to me by publisher Ysbryd Games, but bizarrely enough, it reminded me initially of Bloodborne. A 2D platformer from Nautilus Games, Everdeep Aurora begins on the surface, where a ruptured crimson moon fills the sky with blazing meteors. That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. 


I thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however. But there is a frog by a campfire, who tells you that everybody else has sought shelter underground, and hands you a drill so you can follow them.

                              <span>When it launched last year, DLSS 3 support and Radeon-beating ray tracing capabilities propelled the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti to the top of our 1440p graphics card estimations. Only its high price remains an ongoing concern, though the Amazon Spring Deal Days sale (that’s the Amazon Big Spring Sale to US folk) can at least take some of the sting out of upgrading. There are, while they last, cut-price RTX 4060 Ti models up for grabs on both sides of the pond.

                              <span>One of the most controversial and often-cited criticisms of modern AI systems is that they’re built from, and dependent on, the stolen work of other people. It’s far from the only criticism people have of this new technology, which might make us wonder exactly why anyone wants it in the first place. Today, I’d like to talk about some of the brighter futures that might come out of generative AI for us, as well as why the path toward them might be a tricky one to walk cleanly.

                              <span>My time with Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 for review was neat, mainly because it&#x27;s a good video game and an anecdote generator. But it reinforced one thing for me that I&#x27;ve increasingly come to realise about myself: I actually can&#x27;t cope with character creators that let you like, tweak the finest details. I do not want to define the curls of each individual nose hair or adjust the angle of the mole on one&#x27;s forehead. I&#x27;m far too indecisive for any of this! Let me roll the dice, please.

So it is with the Intel Core i5-12400F: this was a great-value midranger when it was new, and now you get it at a true budget-tier price of £108.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is an RPG of many admirable qualities. I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.
DLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.
Improving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.

                              <span>You know when you remember a game really fondly and instead of ageing alongside you, it becomes more modern in memory? The Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 experience is, essentially, how I remember its predecessor Dragon&#x27;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. To me, DD2 feels like a remaster of the first, except it looks nicer, is more expansive, and features some rejigs to things like your AI pals.
Not that any of this is a bad thing! In fact, DD2&#x27;s closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn&#x27;t only grander, it&#x27;s still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it&#x27;s great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian&#x27;s fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I&#x27;m always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn&#x27;t reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.

It’s the 2TB model, sliced down to £86, which is the cheapest this particular drive has been since last year’s Black Friday. Not to mention about the same price as a 1TB WD Black SN850X, while providing twice as much room.

                              <span>In what&#x27;s quite the shake up for Overwatch 2, Blizzard have announced that starting with Season 10, all of its heroes will be unlocked for all players. And this includes all new heroes going forwards, too, so the next hero Venture will unlock immediately for everyone when the latest season drops. Otherwise, there&#x27;s changes to unlocking premium skins, earning premium coins, and some tidbits on what we can expect from Season 11.

                              <span>Amazon’s big sale events, as overfrequent as they are, do at least reliably provide the discerning Steam Deck owner with good opportunities to grab a new microSD card. Case in point, Amazon Spring Deal Days – which launched today – has some alluringly low prices on the me-approved Samsung Evo Select. That’s on both the 256GB and the (also me-approved) 512GB models.

                              <span>It&#x27;s GDC week, and conversations are being had about AI. Ubisoft have blundered into this, in classic Ubi style, by revealing that they&#x27;ve had an R&amp;D team beavering away on a project called NEO NPC. It&#x27;s the usual pitch. &quot;Have you ever dreamed of having a real conversation with an NPC in a video game?&quot;, asks Ubi&#x27;s official post about it. And what all people who make this fail to understand that the answer most normal people give if they think about it is &quot;Erm, probably no, actually?&quot;

Update 1.6 arrived yesterday, with enough changes that the patch notes are 7308 words long. It bumps the farm-o-life sim&#x27;s co-op player limit to eight, adds hundreds of new items, opens up a new progression system for &quot;powerful perks and items&quot;, adds new events, lets you drink mayonnaise, and so much more that. Best of all, it lets you have more pets. New pets. Pets wearing hats.

                              <span>Generative AI is all over the entertainment industries right now, and lots of people in games are making excited noises about finding new ways to integrate it into their products, from game developers and publishers such as Ubisoft and Square Enix to platform holders and hardware firms such as Epic and Nvidia. This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?

                              <span>Just when I thought I was past being surprised by games adding battle royale modes, Blizzard today announced one for World Of Warcraft. Plunderstorm will drop 60 pirates onto the Arathi Highlands to fight monsters, loot chests, level up, acquire abilities, and beat the hell out of each other as a storm closes in. It&#x27;s initially due to run only for several weeks and will use wholly separate characters, though you can unlock cosmetics for your main wizards.

                              <span>Later this week, Payload Studios&#x27; open world vehicular survival builder TerraTech Worlds launches into early access. As the name implies, it&#x27;s a bigger, bolder and more ambitious take on their still very popular sandbox game TerraTech, but according to Payload&#x27;s founder and CEO Russ Clarke, they&#x27;re viewing this new version as more of a successor to TerraTech than a full-bodied sequel. &quot;The overall quality of experience is really a huge leap forward,&quot; Clarke told me during a press presentation last week. &quot;We&#x27;re not calling it a sequel because we felt that making it a sequel would be a bit too constraining.&quot; Rather, it&#x27;s &quot;more of a reimagining&quot; of the original game, says Clarke, with a change in engine and fresh investment from Tencent allowing them to reach the full potential of their original vision.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have any particular expectations for Heart Machine&#x27;s open world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel so... broken-up, I guess. In this sequel to 2016&#x27;s alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.
The aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio&#x27;s last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed&#x27;s review, &quot;has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels&quot;. Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted.

Beyond that, look forward to games including mech-riding farming game Lightyear Frontier and the colossal alien invasion strategy game from the XCOM Long War team, Terra Invicta.

Riven: The Sequel To Myst was the 1997 sequel to Myst, the 1993 pre-rendered adventure game which sold a million CD-ROM drives and launched a thousand specks of spittle from John Walker&#x27;s mouth. The remake previously had a longwinded name of its own, Riven: New Discoveries Of The Lost D&#x27;ni Empire, but now is simply named Riven. They should rebrand again and call it Riven: The Sequel To The Myst Remake.

                              <span>Detective Edward Carnby looks very different these days, and not only because he’s made of a lot more polygons. Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.
Carnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.

There&#x27;s a demo out right now that lets you explore a portion of the sandy map, try out a handful of the characters, and ride some rusty vehicles ahead of its release next month on April 25th.

                              <span>In the run-up to Total War: Pharaoh at the end of last year, a slightly strange question popped into my head: &quot;What if someone made a Total War game that also had the handsome anime looks of Fire Emblem: Three Houses?&quot; Clearly, it was also a question on the minds on Japanese indie developers ThinkGames Inc, who have just announced their debut game Valiant Tactics EX. The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that&#x27;s not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn&#x27;t just an anime Total War-like. It&#x27;s also a whopping great deckbuilding game.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard&#x27;s big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a &quot;massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,&quot; so if you&#x27;ve been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they&#x27;ll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here&#x27;s the rest of the line-up:

                              <span>Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&amp;D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&amp;D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&amp;D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&amp;D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&amp;D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

                              <span>The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It&#x27;s so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it&#x27;s unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.</span>

                              <span>Update, 3/19/24:
The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it&#x27;s a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you&#x27;re marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it&#x27;s a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

                              <span>Balatro, the hit poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder, has hit 1 million sales within its first month of release. Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.
Created by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I&#x27;m so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can&#x27;t grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I&#x27;m so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.</span>

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member&#x27;s library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…</span>

                              <span>Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey&#x27;s Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory&#x27;s Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,&quot; Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you&#x27;re a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game&#x27;s metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there&#x27;s a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

                              <span>SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it&#x27;s due out in &quot;early 2025&quot; as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today&#x27;s, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game&#x27;s new &quot;REV&quot; system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we&#x27;ll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK&#x27;s original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year.

                              <span>Relative quiet over the past few months may have given the impression that Australia has lost interest in site-blocking injunctions. But just like waiting for a bus, suddenly two come along at once. The first aims to block Australians&#x27; view of more than 30 pirate sites, a disproportionate number serving the pirate anime market. A brand-new application sees Apple in a surprise partnership with Hollywood and Netflix, because everyone has exclusives to protect these days.

                              <span>A copyright lawsuit filed by several major publishers puts the future of the Internet Archive&#x27;s scan-and-lend library at risk. In a recent appeal, the non-profit organization argued that its solution is protected by fair use and critical to preserving digital books. The publishers, however, frame it as a radical and unlawful threat to their exclusive right to publish ebooks.

It helps that I&#x27;m hunting Bigfoot. Hefting my magical bow, I peer around a tree trunk at the creature as he wanders down a slope of vivid orange grass sprinkled with pale blue rock.

                              <span>A piracy-related court order obtained by Spanish football league LaLiga should&#x27;ve been relatively easy to explain. Instead, it now sits at the heart of a controversy that began with misinformation and is now being fueled by mischaracterization and misinterpretation. Today we&#x27;ll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

                              <span>Italian telco watchdog AGCOM has taken on the task of rolling out one of the largest piracy-blocking schemes the Internet has ever witnessed. The organization fiercely defends its IP-address blocking efforts and has full confidence in its technical expertise. Curiously, however, AGCOM&#x27;s domain name is only partly functioning, as it explicitly requires a www subdomain.

Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it&#x27;s narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses &quot;The Hero&quot; of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, the &quot;Two Nations,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Monsters&quot; that players will be killing plenty of during their journey.

After that, read about how Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has just one save file.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it&#x27;s great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
&quot;Photo mode returns in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II,&quot; a Ninja Theory tweet reads. &quot;Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week.&quot; 
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024.

                              <span>Update, 03/15/24:
Following the rough launch of Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which is an HD port combo of the original Star Wars: Battlefront and Star Wars: Battlefront II on modern consoles and PC, developer Aspyr Media says it&#x27;s working to address issues and increase network stability. 
Shortly after the game&#x27;s launch on March 14, players across all platforms (but especially PC), experienced server issues preventing them from getting into matches as well as other connectivity issues like disconnects, rubberbanding, and more once actually in a match. The result was a wave of disappointment from players excited to play these classic multiplayer games. Now, a day later, Aspyr has acknowledged the issues and is working to fix them. 
&quot;We&#x27;d like to thank the Battlefront community…</span>

                              <span>Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. It&#x27;s being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an &quot;innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.&quot;
Disney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you&#x27;re a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there&#x27;s a new game to keep an eye on. 
Currently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&amp;D setting Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature &quot;unique cooperative gameplay,&quot; the studio says. 
&quot;Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,&quot; the announcement reads.&quot; 
There&#x27;s no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. 
News of this D&amp;D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&amp;D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&amp;D game released was Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer&#x27;s review of it here.

                              <span>In 2023, Sega Sammy Holdings acquired Rovio, subsequently making the famed Angry Birds developer a subsidiary of Sega Europe. While Sega&#x27;s Japanese social media account shared a photo of a Red statue standing alongside Sega&#x27;s other mascots (see below), we haven&#x27;t seen the acquisition impact the games to this point. That changed today, as Sega and Rovio announced a multi-game crossover event between Sonic and Angry Birds on mobile devices.
The crossover event even comes with its own storyline, which includes a plot to steal the Angry Birds&#x27; eggs that accidentally creates a portal between the world of Angry Birds and Sonic&#x27;s world. Sonic, Red, and their friend groups must work together across five mobile titles to stop Dr. Eggman. The event will include new playable characters, cross-brand c…</span>

However, online play will remain available after the game&#x27;s delisting, and purchased copies of the collection will remain available for re-download from the Steam store.

                              <span>The creators of RuneScape, Andrew and Paul Gower, have revealed Brighter Shores, a new point-and-click fantasy adventure MMORPG. And if you&#x27;re a fan of RuneScape, Brightet Shores looks like a game you&#x27;ll want to keep an eye on. 
After starting Jagex in 1999, the Gower brothers focused their efforts on the studio&#x27;s first big release: RuneScape. The rest is history. RuneScape is still a very popular game today, both in its modern form and as Old School RuneScape. The Gowers left Jagex in 2010 and little was known about what they were up to until now. It turns out Andrew Gower was working as the lead designer on their new game, while Paul Gower was working as the narrative designer for it.

After checking the game out for a few hours alongside some of the leads at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, last month, cover story writer and Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart and I have a pretty good idea about what to expect from No Rest for the Wicked&#x27;s early access release – you can read my preview thoughts here and his cover story here.

                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>
