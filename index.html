Larian&#x27;s epic RPG had people asking: why aren&#x27;t all games like this? But in an angry tone of voice that we feel left some things out of the conversation. Also, Nate challenges a Times columnist to single MMA combat, and we talk about the games we&#x27;ve been playing this week (spoilers: none of them are Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3!).

                              <span>When I wrote up yesterday&#x27;s big dollop of Starfield info I was expecting readers to focus on the stuff about housing, mechs and giant snake cults, in roughly that order. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a slight stir about the inability to complete the game without killing anyone. &quot;Disappointing&quot;, responded Youtuber Mike BurnFire in the QTs. Opined Mama Bedlam: &quot;A fully pacifist run not existing (without mods) is a genuinely worrying sign to do with the flexibility of what the game can do&quot;. Some players took the news as a brazen provocation. As ManyATrueNerd put it: &quot;CHALLENGE. FUCKING. ACCEPTED.&quot;

                              <span>The brutish &quot;X curio is like Y behemoth&quot; logic of mass entertainment nooze requires me to associate Selkie Harbour&#x27;s The Anglerfish Project with Starfield. They do form a pleasant contrast, in fairness. Both are space games but one doesn&#x27;t have a fishing mechanic, whereas the other is all fishing mechanic. One is about visiting strange new worlds, establishing outposts and shooting or romancing the heck out of the locals, while the other maroons you on a single asteroid. The Anglerfish Project deserves better than to serve only as a counterpoint for the Bethesda colossus, however - it&#x27;s a sweet and tidy stargaze &#x27;em up with a dry sense of humour, and you can download it for free on Itch.io.

                              <span>The rest of the RPS Treehouse might be fully engrossed in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 at the moment, but the main thing that&#x27;s been on my mind for the last couple of weeks is stealthy strategy games. Primarily, the exceedingly excellent Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, but also Harebrained Scheme&#x27;s upcoming turn-based tactics &#x27;em up, The Lamplighters League, a game I&#x27;ve been quietly looking forward to ever since it was announced earlier this year.
Specifically, I&#x27;ve been playing through a handful of missions from the middle of The Lamplighters League&#x27;s campaign, getting to grips with its full roster of agents and their unique set of skills. It continues to be just as stylish as the opening mission I played in May, but I&#x27;m not gonna lie. I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of whiplash coming straight from Shadow Gambit into this, but even if I&#x27;d arrived fresh and green, I don&#x27;t think even all my years of tactics playing and XCOM-liker-liking would have been enough to prepare me for just how gosh darn difficult it is.

With divine expedience you must go forth into a world from which all unworthy creatures impart their knowledge with great excitations, entangling their speech with a verbosity comparable only to how the holy miracle does imbue our city with its fearsome illumination. If you think this a questionable affectation then guard thyselves, oh Penitent Ones, for you really are in store for an awful lot of this.  


Beyond that, Blasphemous 2 is a cracking Metroidvania rooted in satisfying combat and rewarding exploration of the ‘ooh, I didn’t realise this bit was connected to that bit’ vein. Neither element is on the same level of Dark Souls, but then what is?

                              <span>Bethesda&#x27;s vaunted space bonanza Starfield is available for preload today on PC Game Pass - if you&#x27;re downloading it on Steam, you&#x27;ll need to wait a little longer (even longer, if you plan on playing Starfield on Steam Deck). The file weighs in at 139.84 GB, so be sure to clear some disc space before you force this galaxy&#x27;s worth of grey rocks, NASApunks and hopefully extensive Event Horizon comparisons into your protesting PC, which has only ever lived to serve you and bring you joy. Might be an idea to double-check those Starfield system specs, too, and make that final call on whether to invest in a new SSD.

They&#x27;re the team behind this May&#x27;s triumphant System Shock remake, which Jeremy Peel described in his review as &quot;a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design&quot;. They&#x27;re also the studio behind last week&#x27;s surprise-released Quake 2 remaster, and a bunch of other classic 90s remasters including the PC version of DOOM 64 and Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It&#x27;s safe to say they know how to pull off a retro (sorry, Kamiya-san) comeback.

The second one was that there was still no way in hell I could recommend it to anyone for a “next-gen” price tag of $50. The graphics are clean and crisp, but otherwise it’s the…

                              <span>The season is about to change, and with it, we have some changes to Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga. The game&#x27;s upcoming Legends DLC will launch in time to join the fall playlist, which Freedom Games has showcased in a new trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uSb8BhMJutY
Developer Dancing Dragon Games (Skyborn, Echoes of Aetheria) first entered the battlefield with Symphony of War in June 2022. The title takes inspiration from series like Fire Emblem and Ogre Battle, which has resonated with retro strategy-RPG fans. The Legends DLC was revealed during the 2023 Guerrilla Collective showcase, just shy of the game&#x27;s one year anniversary. This update promises to deliver eight new chapters for the main story, 13 new unit classes, new characters, and additional game modes like the always-welcome New Game+.

Symphony of War moves beyond focusing on specific troops to building up larger squads of up to nine units, eventually giving players command of a full army. The main heroes come into play when it&#x27;s time to lead those squads into the turn-based battles throughout the campaign. Familiar ground for strategy-RPG aficionados, no doubt.
Legends DLC plans to expand upon this these mechanics with a new army meta that introduces necromancy and the undead. If raising an army of your own sounds like too much hassle, maybe literally raising them from the dead would be a more, um, palatable option?
As for the aforementioned new chapters, the eight added to the lineup are concurrent with the existing main story. They&#x27;ll focus on expanding plots and tying up loose ends instead of starting anew with fresh faces and factions. 
We&#x27;ll get to see how it all expands for ourselves when Symphony of War: The Nephilim Saga goes live with its Legends DLC on August 28, 2023.

                              <span>It&#x27;s officially Call of Duty hype time, as Activision has officially revealed the next chapter in the Modern Warfare series: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The FPS will serve as a direct sequel to last year&#x27;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
This newest entry is being co-developed by Sledgehammer Games and Infinity Ward, which is the same as the 2011 release. The reveal includes some details on the new content coming to Call of Duty including the first-ever Modern Warfare zombies mode. We also got a reveal trailer that shows off some of the campaign:

New Campaign and multiplayer as expected
The new campaign will pick up right where Modern Warfare 2 left off. According to the release, players can expect action-packed cinematic experiences like before as well as …</span>

                              <span>Quantum probably isn’t the first game that comes to mind when you think of the golden years of the arcade. The 1982 vector cabinet, designed by Betty Ryan, has maybe a less exciting concept than Asteroids or Centipede. In fact, the first time I played it was part of the Atari 50 collection.
Atari and Sneakybox’s Recharged line of titles aren’t leaving anything by the side of the road, however, as Quantum: Recharged is the newest release. Surprisingly, it’s low-key one of my favorites. I’ve never been a massive fan of score-chasing arcade titles, and that hasn’t changed with the Recharged games. I prefer games with a bit of progression to them, and there’s more of that in titles like Gravitar: Recharged. However, the simple and fast design of Quantum really sucked me in.

                              <span>We knew that Red Dead Redemption II would be coming to Switch, and now it&#x27;s finally here! Whether it&#x27;s actually worth the (checks notes) $50 Rockstar is charging for it is one thing: but at least it comes with the Undead Nightmare DLC, which is one of the silliest romps the studio has ever created.
In other Switch eShop news, Quake II was surprised-released, and we even reviewed it (on PC)! This classic still holds up, but if you want something newer, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is out on August 18. Here&#x27;s the gist of this extremely Jet Set Radio-looking game: &quot;Red is a graffiti writer who lost his head and instead has an AI robohead.

                              <span>GameMill Entertainment has lifted the lid off of Flu Games The Walking Dead: Destinies. And, uh, they probably should have waited until it cooked for a bit longer before showing it off.
Basing itself off the popular AMC adaptation of The Walking Dead comic book series, The Walking Dead: Destinies promises to be a narrative-focused game that lets you rewrite the events of seasons 1-4 with your actions. I guess a lot of stuff happened in those seasons. I don’t know, I didn’t watch the show. It sounds like if your favorite character died and you want them to stay alive, you might have the option to do so here.
https://youtu.be/ARpGTkOlufQ
I’m not saying the game looks terrible, but this trailer is absolutely awful. One of the first scenes has a pair of gun-toting dudes approach some sort of compound. They look out over the field, and there’s a bunch of watch towers that don’t have any textures. What’s funny is that the same watch tower model is shown later on in the trailer, but on that occasion, it has textures. There’s also compression all over the video that is so heavy that I had to double-check to make sure I didn’t have it set to 480p.
The game itself looks pretty rough. The graphics seem a couple of generations behind, which I don’t usually mind, but it’s not like the art style was adapted to make up for it. It just looks kind of gross. It could be good, it’s just this trailer certainly doesn’t make it look that way. They probably should have, uh… framed it better.
The Walking Dead: Destinies is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. There’s no release date, but they’re already saying it will be $49.99.

                              <span>Sonic the Hedgehog, known as Ogilvie Maurice Hedgehog among true fans, is one of the most famous mascots in video game history. Still, unlike Mario, who&#x27;s yet to appear in a mainline game that&#x27;s not an absolute blast, the blue blur is reminiscent of those once-promising actors who had to start taking roles in C-list movies to maintain their exuberantly decadent lifestyle. It&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow, but we have to accept that Sonic has starred in about as many crappy games as he has in good ones.
Which one is the worst of the worst?

                              <span>Gamescom 2023 will be kicking off next week, featuring some of the biggest names in the industry. One such name is AMD, and the PC hardware giant could announce some new lines in its RDNA 3 range.
That&#x27;s if a recent tweet from AMD&#x27;s own Scott Herkelman is anything to go by. Herkelman says that Team Red will be in attendance at this year&#x27;s Gamescom, bringing with it the company&#x27;s &quot;next major product announcements.&quot;
https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1691864001129443634
What this will be exactly we can&#x27;t say. However, judging from the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;announcements,&quot; it sounds like it&#x27;s going to be more than one thing.
New graphics cards, surely?
Suffice it to say, we would assume that AMD will announce its next line of graphics cards in its latest 7000 series. A report from PC Gamer speculates that it could well be the leaked RX 7800 XT.
That may not be all. Some people commenting under Herkelman&#x27;s tweet are holding out that AMD will announce FSR 3. For those who don&#x27;t know, FSR (or FidelityFX Super Resolution) is the tech giant&#x27;s own take on algorithmic graphical upscaling, similar to Nvidia&#x27;s DLSS and Intel&#x27;s Xe Super Sampling.
AMD seems to be trailing behind Nvidia at the moment. Its biggest rival has already released a number of products in its Ada Lovelace range. We&#x27;ve already seen the likes of the RTX 4090 right through to a 4060 from Team Green.
Conversely, there have pretty much only been two launches in AMD&#x27;s RDNA 3 range: the RX 7900 (XT, XTX, and GRE variants) and the RX 7600. Now would the time for Team Red to start unveiling some more in order to keep up with Nvidia.

Or, at least, that&#x27;s what this particular CoD&#x27;s marketing campaign would have you believe. With a huge new information drop slated to go live in very short order, fans of the franchise have already got a whole slew of things to be looking forward to, not the least of which is the return of the legendary Zombies mode.
Naturally, now&#x27;s also the right time to remember that Modern Warfare 2 launched less than a year ago to reasonable critical acclaim, only for Activision to squander any launch-day goodwill over the course of the next couple of seasons.

                              <span>Capcom&#x27;s Exoprimal is the company&#x27;s first full-fledged live-service offering, and it&#x27;s definitely taken the job to heart. Notably, Exoprimal&#x27;s  Title Update 1 is already available as of August 16, delivering a strong follow-up to the game&#x27;s official July 14 launch date. Players now have access to a surprisingly large roster of new goodies, the highlight of it all being the introduction of Alpha-variant exosuits.
Exoprimal is, of course, still in its early days, being a live-service title and all that. Capcom did successfully deliver a content-rich and feature-complete game on day one, however, which doesn&#x27;t always happen with games that are supposed to last for years at a time. This means that, even though Exoprimal players have had their hands full since the game&#x27;s come out, they will now…</span>

                              <span>Get ready for liftoff. Starfield preloads begin Thursday as the game has just gone gold (which means Bethesda&#x27;s development of Starfield is effectively complete!). Now, players can download the game pre-release on its platforms, but it will be truly ready to play when September 6 (or September 1 for early access players) rolls around. Unfortunately, Steam users will have to wait longer for Starfield preloads to take effect.
Those who own an Xbox Series X|S or a PC with the Xbox app can preload Starfield on August 17. Players on Steam have to wait much longer as preloading on that platform occurs on August 30. If you&#x27;ve bought the Premium Edition or Constellation Edition physically or digitally, you&#x27;ll be able to gain access to Starfield five days early on September 1. To make the wait even more arduous, the Xbox Twitter page says its hand is moving &quot;closer to [the] giant LAUNCH button.&quot;

After delays, Starfield is actually ready
Starfield was originally going to be released on November 11, 2022, but it was pushed back almost an entire year. “We know you’ve waited a long time to play something new from us,&quot; said director Todd Howard after announcing the September 6 release date in a trailer. &quot;Believe it or not, we’re kind of the same.&quot;
He later said, &quot;We really just can&#x27;t wait for you all to play it.&quot; Now we&#x27;re nearing that time. Many games from Bethesda&#x27;s past were criticized for awkward facial animation and bugs across the board, but this new game engine may take Bethesda to the next level. It could lead to impressive showings for upcoming games like The Elder Scrolls VI. As of last year, that fantasy RPG is currently in a design stage of development.

                              <span>In my eyes, Blasphemous 2 is a story of redemption.
Throughout the blighted lands in this sequel, you will find no shortage of denizens hoping to be redeemed. Condemned to often dark, grisly fates by the entity called the Miracle, these people graciously accept their punishments, hoping that their pain will absolve them of sin. Similarly, Blasphemous 2 strikes me as a game that wants to absolve itself from its predecessor’s shortcomings. I briefly played Blasphemous before taking on this review, but I honestly couldn’t get into it. I felt the combat was stiff, the platforming was aggravating, and the story absolutely did not grab me with its ornate, often vague prose.
On two of those counts, Blasphemous 2 marks an inspired improvement. In a world where even Mickey Mouse needs a Metroidvani…</span>

Red Dead Redemption is out on the Switch eShop today — with a physical release coming later in the year. There&#x27;s been controversy around the port&#x27;s price point and concerns over the game&#x27;s quality (given the state of the GTA Trilogy&#x27;s launch...), so what is this port like?
We&#x27;ll have a review of the Switch version of the game out soon here at Nintendo Life, but in the meantime, the venerable Felix over on our YouTube channel pulled a fast draw on the eShop and rode into the Wild West today to check out just how Rockstar&#x27;s critically acclaimed Western runs on the console.

The TMNT range covers costumes, emotes, unique wearables and more, with Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo taking to the game&#x27;s crazy courses. If you are wondering what the Turtles might look like in Fall Guys&#x27; bean form, Nintendo has revealed a trailer showing the heroes in a half shell in action.

Adding to the ever-growing number of tie-in series, games and comics in The Walking Dead universe, GameMill Entertainment and AMC have today announced a brand-new game, The Walking Dead: Destinies, and, yes, it&#x27;s coming to Switch (thanks, IGN).
This is a narrative-based action adventure game that looks set to follow the events of the first four seasons of the popular AMC show... until it doesn&#x27;t. The unique gimmick here is that the show&#x27;s key turning points are in your hands. Didn&#x27;t like one character&#x27;s death in the early seasons? You can choose to keep them alive in the place of another.

The latest Japanese charts are in courtesy of Famitsu (thanks, Gematsu) and it&#x27;s once again Pikmin 4 that takes home the crown with an additional 69,989 in unit sales. This takes the game&#x27;s total sales to a rather ominous-looking 666,377.
Following this, we&#x27;ve got Mario Kart 8 Deluxe taking second place, with Tears of the Kingdom settling for third this week. We&#x27;ve got no new titles to speak of, with the usual suspects making up the remaining seven positions.

Publisher PQube and developer Playstark have today brought the action-packed roguelite shooter Die After Sunset to Switch, with the game available to pick up on the eShop right now.
This one will see you choose between three different characters — April, Rido and Hune — and drop into Earth to help fight off hoards of an alien race called the Murkor. This species grows in strength when hiding in the shadows, so you&#x27;ll want to drag them out into the light before taking them on with your chosen hero&#x27;s arsenal. Kill as many as you can before the sun sets then repeat the cycle the following day — simple, right?

                              <span>A right rollicking resurrection.
We&#x27;re big fans of 2019&#x27;s Blasphemous, The Game Kitchen&#x27;s exquisitely dark and gory action-platformer that saw players assume the role of The Penitent One as he faced off against the eternally damned Denizens of Cvstodia. With top-notch hack-and-slash action, grotesque bosses, an intricately animated pixel art style and some slick platforming to boot, it remains one of our absolute favourite platformers on Nintendo Switch.
With Blasphemous 2, the story picks up directly after the events of The Wounds of Eventide, the first game&#x27;s final slice of DLC. The Miracle has now returned to Cvstodia and The Penitent One has been resurrected from his eternal slumber to set out on another blood-soaked romp that sees him on the trail of three hideous guardians, and that&#x27;s just for starters.

Developer Crema has today released a brand new update for the Pokémon-inspired MMO Temtem, bringing the game up to ver.1.4.2.
While this latest update does tackle some bugs that had been flagged by the community in recent months, the biggest changes this time around appear to be in balancing the &#x27;Tems&#x27; themselves. 59 different in-game creatures have been tweaked in this patch, with attack powers, HP and skills being changed accordingly.

Publisher GameMill Entertainment has today announced that NASCAR Arcade Rush is set to bring some arcade-inspired racing to Switch next month as it zooms our way on 15th September.
The game seems to walk the line between a realistic racer and a more party-oriented one like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Yes, the courses look wacky (each is a twist on an iconic NASCAR track) and there are speed boosts and death-defying jumps, but your not going to find any banana peel power-ups here.

Images for Lenovo&#x27;s upcoming handheld gaming device, dubbed the &#x27;Legion Go&#x27;, have leaked online, showcasing exactly what the system will look like when it eventually launches.
Spoilers: it kinda looks like a cross between the Switch and the Steam Deck. Boasting angular edges, a bulky frame, and an admittedly lovely-looking screen, the Legion Go appears to be aiming to get the best of both worlds. It&#x27;s got removable Joy-Con-inspired controllers as well as its own adjustable kickstand.

Red Dead Redemption isn&#x27;t the only big release arriving on the Switch this week. One other game that&#x27;s well worth a look is the roguelike shoot &#x27;em up Vampire Survivors, which originally made its debut on Windows and Xbox platforms last year.
Now, this indie success story has finally made its way across to Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid platform, so how does this version hold up? Firstly, here&#x27;s a bit from our own review here on Nintendo Life, where we awarded it an &quot;excellent&quot; nine out of ten stars:

                              <span>Like many people that near their eighteenth birthday, the Xbox 360 will soon lose support from its parent company. Today, an announcement on Xbox Wire revealed that the Xbox 360 store will be shutting down on July 29, 2024. This means you will no longer be able to purchase games or DLC on the console, and the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will stop working altogether.
However, the post makes it clear that content bought beforehand will still be playable after the cutoff date, so digital games on the 360 should still work just fine, and you&#x27;ll always be able to re-download them. Games with online multiplayer features will also still be functional, though that exists on more of a game-by-game basis. For example, the servers of many Halo games have already been shut down. And while the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app will no longer work on the 360, your content there transfers to anywhere else you have the app.
Additionally, backwards compatible 360 games will still be available to purchase and play on the Xbox One and Series X/S. While this doesn&#x27;t encompass every game on the 360 store, it does cover most of the platform&#x27;s most popular titles. Xbox linked its full list of backwards compatible games in today&#x27;s announcement post. Here&#x27;s the most recent batch from November 2021:

                              <span>Alan Wake 2 has been a long time coming, but fans will have to wait a little bit longer as the game has been pushed from October 17 to October 27.
In a press release, developer Remedy Entertainment doesn&#x27;t cite a technical reason for the delay, only writing that “October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.”
This likely refers to the fact that Alan Wake 2 was originally going to release just three days before the arrival of heavy hitters Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both launch on October 20. The new date now puts it a full week outside of that blast radius, providing some breathing room for players looking to enjoy some or all of those titles around launch. 
Alan Wake 2 unfolds 13 years after the original game and stars two protagonists: the titular author and FBI agent Saga Anderson. Saga is investigating a murder case in the Pacific Northwest, while Alan has been trapped in the nightmarish realm of The Dark Place since the first game&#x27;s conclusion. Players switch between both characters and can play as much or as little of their stories as they see fit. Remedy has stated that the sequel is a pure survival horror title this time around. To learn more about the game, check out our preview of co-protagonist Saga Anderson’s gameplay chapter from Summer Game Fest. 
Alan Wake 2 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</span>

Steeped in religious themes, the narrative of Blasphemous 2 tells of a land unable to overcome the curse placed on it by a higher power, regardless of how repentant its people are. Playing Blasphemous 2, I sometimes felt the same, as I wondered how I could possibly overcome the challenge before me. But like the denizens of The City of the Blessed Name, I persevered. And though the curses being thrown around my house each time I died were of a different variety than those cast in Blasphemous 2’s story, I loved nearly every minute o…</span>

                              <span>Včera vláda schválila materiál s návrhem „Harmonogram migrace ústředních orgánů státní správy na jednotnou doménu .gov.cz“, který stanovuje jízdní řád pro velké úřady k přechodu na doménu gov.cz. Tato migrace má zvýšit kybernetickou bezpečnost uživatelů služeb českého e-governmentu, zvýšit uživatelskou přívětivost, důvěryhodnost a jednotnou prezentaci webových stránek státu a e-mailových domén úředníků. Stát má zaregistrované jméno domény gov.cz již od roku 2001. A jak to tak bývá, snahy o zavedení jednotné domény a pořádku v e-governmentním doménovém prostoru připomínají pohyb po sinusoidě – jednou jsi nahoře, jednou dole.

Podle něj proběhne další pokus státu převést úřady na jednotnou státní doménu s tím, že tento krok má zvýšit bezpečnost uživatelů služeb českého e-governmentu, uživatelskou přívětivost, důvěryhodnost a jednotnou prezentaci webových stránek státu a e-mailových domén úředníků, informuje CZ.NIC.</span>

                              <span>Tvůrci „komerční implementace Wine“ uvádí u nové verze CrossOver 23 pět hlavních novinek. První je podpora DirectX 12 na macOS, která mimo jiné znamená běh her jako Diablo II Resurrected a Diablo IV na macOS Ventura (jde o první DX12 hry, které na této verzi běží, další tituly máme očekávat). Druhou novinkou je podpora Geometry shaderů a transformací na macOS, díky čemuž opět poběží řada dosud nefunkční her (např. TEKKEN 7, Street Fighter V, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries ad.) – s dodatkem, že nejlepší výsledky jsou při běhu přes wined3d (Wine implementace Direct3D) namísto obvyklého DXVK (mapujícího Direct3D na Vulkan).</span>

Fast forward two years, the StarFive VisionFive 2 has begun to enjoy wide availability and for $100+ this RISC-V development board features a quad-core RISC-V processor via the StarFive JH7110 SoC with integrated GPU, up to 8GB of RAM, HDMI 2.0 output, dual Gigabit Ethernet, dual USB 3.0 ports, and more for around $100 USD.

                              <span>When The Messenger was released in 2018, Thierry Boulanger went into its launch with reasonable expectations. He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...</span>

                              <span>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge&#x27;s big DLC Dimension Shellshock finally has a release date, as well as another new playable character. 
The expansion arrives on August 31 for $7.99, and a new trailer reveals that fan-favorite character Karai is joining the fun. Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.


Dimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character.

Going &quot;gold” basically means the game is complete and ready to be sent to be printed on discs and shipped to stores. Bethesda also revealed when players can pre-load the digital version of the game. Xbox players can do so beginning tomorrow, August 17. Steam users get their turn on August 30.

While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.
It all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn&#x27;t as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots.

Baldur’s Gate 3 is a surprisingly human tale. That may sound strange to say about a game with space lizards and brain worms at its center, but behind the hags and psychic tadpoles, Baldur’s Gate 3 is about a group of very broken people trying to find their way in life and maybe save the world. Or turn it into a smoldering heap of agony and misery. It depends on how you feel that day. Whether you choose peace or something less savory, Baldur’s Gate 3’s intricate writing …</span>

                              <span>Gamescom is on the horizon and kicks off with Opening Night Live next week, the E3-style showcase of upcoming games hosted by Geoff Keighley. Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.
Crimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. 
Next Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.

The game&#x27;s presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.


Crimson Desert doesn&#x27;t have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We&#x27;ll likely find out of that&#x27;s still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.</span>

                              <span>Do you want to last longer in bed? Well, stop trying, because the new path to prestige is finishing as fast as possible. The bar has been set at 7 minutes, 54 seconds, as speedrunner Mae was able to charm the pants off of Lae&#x27;zel in that time. In Baldur’s Gate 3, I mean.
Mae had previously proven that Baldur’s Gate 3 can be completed in around 10 minutes, which is roughly how long I’ve spent in the entire game (that’s not a condemnation, I’ve just been busy with other things). But really, getting is the real goal of CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate 3. Saving the world is just something you do to meet potential partners.
https://youtu.be/C-Rkgdcj5Ds
The video is generally what you’d expect, but fascinating all the same. Mae uses a lot of the normal techniques used to speedrun the game’s opening. They then focus on freeing Lae&#x27;zel and getting on their good side. They then settle down in the romantic light of a campfire, sneak away into the night, and submit to their base urges. Hoo boy. I just love a partner with focus.
Frankly, 7:30 minutes of foreplay can be a bit disappointing. Hopefully, the after-glow and pillow talk aren’t part of the run. I wouldn’t recommend speedrunning intimacy with your partner unless you’re on break at the office or waiting on a bus. However, in this busy world we live in, aren’t we always aiming to be more efficient? We often try to minimize and abbreviate our pleasures so we can get back to what really matters: doomscrolling across the dying remains of social media.
Alright, so now we’ve seen the current Baldur’s Gate world record for copulation. Let’s see you do better. Or worse? I’m not sure anymore.

                              <span>Step into your gi, Digital Eclipse has announced that their interactive documentary, The Making of Karateka, launches on August 29, 2023.
The Making of Karateka is more than just a new port of Jordan Mechner’s legendary 1984 Apple II brawler. It also promises video features, playable prototypes, and design documents providing an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at Mechner’s work. Digital Eclipse has even gone to the work of extrapolating on a prototype to provide it into a full-fledged game called Deathbounce: Rebounded. It’s a dual-stick shooter, which is a pretty great sub-genre.
https://youtu.be/IrS2pipZaH0
Digital Eclipse has last tested the interactive documentary concept with the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. It goes beyond the simple remaster format by going in-depth into the making of the games. Karateka is a great starting point, as Mechner made it years before the more renowned Prince of Persia. It’s a formative game known for its cinematics and rotoscoped animation.
I personally haven’t played Karateka. I’m pretty sure I have a copy of it for my Commodore 64 that I haven’t dug into yet, but I’ll probably just wait for this release to try it. After all, it’s out in just a couple of weeks. The Making of Karateka releases August 29, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. The Switch version is lagging behind those versions, with a planned launch in September.

                              <span>DreadXP has announced that developer LUAL Games’ text adventure [I] Doesn’t Exist will launch on PC September 9, 2023.
Described as “Classic Zork meets existential crisis,” [I] Doesn’t Exist has you awaken in an unfamiliar forest and has you use your noodle to try and escape. However, things promise to not be as they seem, which is great because they already seem weird and unsettling.
Like many text adventures of the early PC days, [I] Doesn’t Exist doesn’t just provide you with walls of descriptive text. It also uses graphics to depict its strange world. Beyond that, there are animations, so you don’t have to rely on your unreliable imagination to paint you a picture.
https://youtu.be/91PdAe-n5VA
[I] Doesn’t Exist also touts the use of &quot;Natural Language Processing&quot; to support its parser and make things more intuitive. While this means the use of AI, the developer is quick to clarify that it isn’t involved in the creation process and is just to make the language parser more natural. In their words:
&quot;Publisher DreadXP and developer LUAL value the authenticity of human-made narratives, and none of the in-game text in [I] doesn’t exist is AI-generated. The Natural Language Processing technology utilized in the game is not affiliated with ChatGPT or other similar AI platforms and utilizes only the player’s input to access pre-written responses by the game’s super-cool writers.&quot;
That’s rather comforting because we all know how well it went when Square Enix tried to make a text adventure using AI.
[I] Doesn’t Exist launches on PC on September 9, 2023. A demo is available to try out right now.

                              <span>Are we sick of hearing about Starfield yet? Unlikely, seeing as it&#x27;s one of the most anticipated games of this year. And the community is already gearing up to unleash some of its own custom mods for the upcoming Bethesda title.
If you head over to Nexus Mods, you&#x27;ll see that the site has now opened up its modding section for the game. Obviously, there&#x27;s nothing there yet (save for some artwork), but it&#x27;s pretty obvious, given the amount of Elder Scrolls and Fallout mods that are forever coming out, that a lot of people are going to be tweaking Starfield the picosecond it comes out.

Just imagine the possibilities. There&#x27;s no end to the potential when it comes to modifying AAA games, and Nexus is one of the most popular places to showcase such projects.
And the winner is...
On top of that, the modding website is also hosting a competition, with a chance to win a copy of Starfield and some other goodies. For example, they&#x27;re giving away a TUF Radeon RX 7900 XT graphics card, a B650-Plus motherboard, some peripherals, and some merchandise.
If you want in on this, you just have to head to the competition page and follow the instructions. The event goes on until August 29, and winners will be selected at random and contacted by Nexus Mods.
It&#x27;s difficult to unbridled the sheer hype for Starfield. Given that it&#x27;s Bethesda&#x27;s first new IP in 25 years, a lot of people are going to be curious about what Todd Howard and his team have been working on. Will it pay off? Only time will tell.

                              <span>But who is the dreamer?
There is no shortage of games that claim Twin Peaks as a primary inspiration, but the legendary TV multimedia experience is yet to take the leap into a full game adaptation. And it&#x27;s not out of a lack of interest in the medium from its creators. Twin Peaks writer and director David Lynch once started to work on a game that would continue the series called Woodcutters From Fiery Ships, and Mark Frost, Twin Peak&#x27;s co-writer, met with the creators of Link&#x27;s Awakening to give them a few ideas.
Then in 2019, both of them signed off on a Twin Peaks VR project, though it&#x27;s more of a collection of interactive sets than a full game. Anything where you get to play as leads Dale Cooper or Laura Palmer, interact with other characters from the show, and work to solve any of it&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Jollypunch Games has announced that the high-flying, toy-robot basketball game, Robodunk, will release on Switch and PC on September 25th, 2023.
I previewed the demo of Robodunk on a distantly long-past Steam Next Fest (it was this past February). It’s an over-the-top basketball game in the vein of NBA Jam. Two robots face a team of two other robots in a match of ups. Beyond just scoring some hoops, your robots are equipped with weapons and can dunk from the edges of space. Also, everything is made of wood for some reason.
https://youtu.be/OP55pjjMSkI
There’s also a roguelite progression where you try to make it as far as you can across various rounds of b-ball. Once you’re inevitably smacked back down to Earth, you can upgrade your robots or hire new ones.
After I wrote my preview for Robodunk, the developer reached out to me to get me to extrapolate on my feedback. At the time, one of my biggest issues was that I felt there was a dearth of personality to the whole affair, despite how over-the-top everything was. He pointed out to me that there are apparently lore entries that get unlocked as you play. What!? In a basketball game? No wonder I didn’t see them. That’s the last place I’d expect to find them.
So, I’m eventually going to play the full version, and I’m definitely going to check out these lore articles that give context to the automated dunks happening in the foreground.
You can check out Robodunk and its lore on September 25th, 2023 on Switch and PC. There’s also a demo available to check out on Steam.

                              <span>Unsurprisingly, the remake of Resident Evil 4 has been doing pretty well for itself since it released in March. Given the months that have elapsed since then, fans have been finding new ways to entertain themselves in what many consider one of Capcom&#x27;s best games.
One such example comes from YouTube user Xenoxygene (as spotted by PCGamesN), in which they challenge themselves to complete the game without firing a single bullet at an enemy.

The idea being to make it all the way to the end with a perfectly abysmal accuracy rating of 0%. However, as you can imagine, there were many tribulations to attempting such a thing in a game known for a lot of gunfire.
How did it go?
The first thing Xenoxygene has to establish is what constitutes …</span>

                              <span>Destiny 2 has had a bit of a rough time after the launch of the Lightfall DLC earlier in 2023. Following a troubled set of releases that came at a higher price than ever before in the history of Destiny, as well as a &quot;disastrous&quot; State of the Game blog post detailing what the developer has in store for the game in the coming months, it hasn&#x27;t been a grand old time for the players.
Destiny 2 Game director Joe Blackburn has, therefore, taken to Twitter/X in an attempt to assuage the community to some extent. In a recent 15-minute video, Blackburn has taken some of the players&#x27; vocal critiques to heart, promising changes and compromises, as well as a renewed focus on PvP.

                              <span>Now here’s a game I didn’t know I needed. Space colony management sims aren’t exactly a rare breed, even after you cross them with survival elements. However, I never realized that the one thing they were missing was the SDF-1.
Jumplight Odyssey bases itself on ‘80s sci-fi anime and does it with such incredible pizzazz and with such elegant depth that I’m absolutely stunned by the result. It feels like a missing Macross game, a title that bases itself not around the war going on but on the survivors aboard the SDF-1 as they cling to hope in the direst of circumstances. It is an exciting development by the team behind Armello.
Now, if only I could play it without getting hindered by bugs.

After what felt like an eternity of Kinetic Games promising that a significant patch was coming, the team finally confirmed it on Discord recently. There&#x27;s also been a public post on Twitter confirming that, yes, the &quot;Ascension&quot; update is inbound and will be going live on August 17 from 10AM UTC onwards.
https://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1691407479119192065
If you want to get in those last few levels before Phasmophobia goes through these changes, now&#x27;s the time.
Everything changes
Over a series of dev posts on Steam, we&#x27;ve learned that a lot of things are going to be different in Phasmo. For one, there&#x27;s some new equipment, which is now going to be tiered. Everyone is also having their levels reset to 0, but it&#x27;s been said that you will be given a badge that indicates where you were before the update. The patch was supposed to be rolling out a little earlier, but the people at Kinetic said they had to delay it a little bit.
Phasmophobia is also coming to consoles, with a projected release date of...well...sometime this month. Who knows, maybe we&#x27;ll get the PS5 and Xbox Series versions on the same day as the big update.
In any case, there&#x27;s a lot to look forward to. So horror fans, mark your calendars for tomorrow, the Progression 2.0 changes are coming!

Already, there are imitators popping up trying to duplicate the game’s special sauce. As with many games that have spurred a sudden explosion of similar titles, it tantalizes developers with its simple but malleable gameplay.
I did play the PC version a few months back and was lucky enough to eventually claw my way from its grips. But with the Switch version dropping, I felt it was time to fall back into its embrace for the sake of the review. Hopefully, I can one day escape again.

                              <span>Hybe, the company behind immensely popular K-pop stars BTS, is getting into video games. The first release from the Korean company’s newfounded games publisher Hybe IM (with IM standing for “Interactive Media”) will be Astra: Knights of Veda, a 2D RPG with more than a touch of Dark Souls and Elden Ring to its heavily-armoured bosses and big scary dog monsters, if its first gameplay trailer is anything to go by.

                              <span>The Alienware AW3423DWF is an outstanding 34-inch OLED ultra-wide that outperforms basically everything else in its category, except for other OLED models. I took a look at it for Digital Foundry last year, and it remains one of my top choices in 2023. Now, with three years of burn-in warranty as standard and a modest price reduction from $1079 to $899, it&#x27;s well worth writing up in a US deals post for Rock Paper Shotgun!

                              <span>Hold onto your warp nacelles and hyperdrives, Starfield aficionados. The game&#x27;s lead designer Emil Pagliarulo and lead quest designer Will Shen have hosted a Discord Q&amp;A about Bethesda&#x27;s forthcoming space colossus. Self-despising fool that I am, I sat up late at the office taking notes throughout - please accept a modest avalanche of new details.


First off, a note on the subject of Starfield and housing. You can own property in &quot;all the major cities in the game&quot;, according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.


Building on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a &quot;Kids Stuff&quot; trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. &quot;No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles,&quot; Pagliarulo added.

Its performance isn&#x27;t quite up there with the fastest options from Samsung or SanDisk, but this memory card still works great on Steam Deck. This Micro SD card normally hovers below the £90 mark, but today it&#x27;s down to a new historic low of just £67, a great value for a Micro SD card of this size!

I&#x27;m going to ask the lads in corporate if we can launch an official RPS funeral plan whereby you can pre-pay to have your skeleton lashed to a wheel and turned loose round the foot of the RPS treehouse. &quot;It&#x27;s what she always wanted,&quot; your assembled family will say, dabbing at a tear gathered in the creases of a bittersweet smile. This week, I ask you to choose between deadly openings and safe closings. What&#x27;s better: mimics, or tactically sealing doors?

You know what’s also a pretty great puzzle game set in successive rooms you need to escape? Portal. You may have heard of it. And now the two are set to collide in an upcoming bit of free DLC that brings Portal’s test chambers to Escape Simulator.

If you wanted some more proof that Netflix is pretty serious about this whole “getting into video games” thing, the movie streaming platform-turned-games publisher is now looking to unite their two fronts by experimenting with game streaming.

                              <span>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.
It seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets.

                              <span>The first game in the Opus series of visual novels (not to be confused with alchemy-themed puzzle machine game Opus Magnum), The Day We Found Earth, begins 14,000 years in the future, on a starship far from our familiar home planet. The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.


Opus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018&#x27;s Rocket Of Whispers and 2021&#x27;s Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. &quot;They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,&quot; is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.

I know there&#x27;s a dungeon master, or DM, who directs proceedings behind a cardboard shield. I know you lob some dice to determine the outcomes of an adventure that&#x27;s contained in the heads of everyone at the roundtable. And that&#x27;s about it.
Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 is based on D&amp;D&#x27;s 5th edition and it&#x27;s meant to honour its rules to the absolute tee. I&#x27;m sure it does! To be honest, though, I haven&#x27;t exactly learned much about D&amp;D by playing it. I don&#x27;t even think of myself as playing D&amp;D, instead I&#x27;m just playing an RPG whose complexity adds a nice mystery to proceedings.

It turns out all those librarians in the 90s were right: using your imagination really is cool and fun! Indeed, our ability to conjure fiction from the ether is fundamental to the ongoing success of D&amp;D. Making up stories with friends is very much a good time, and if you get to kill a goblin or two in the process? Well. That&#x27;s just gravy.


Built upon the foundations of D&amp;D&#x27;s fifth edition ruleset, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 attempts to translate the fundamentals of the game into digital form. But how successful is it at doing so? Can a video game - with all the rigidity that comes with the medium - replicate the freedom of a table-top role playing game?

                              <span>Winding back the clock to rewrite past mistakes is a core stratagem of any Mimimi game. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 might have rekindled the debate about save-scumming over in RPG circles, but in the stealth strategy arena where Mimimi operate, reaching for the F5 and F8 keys to quick load a previous save is as natural as swapping between your party members on 123, or activating their unique abilities to clobber all manner of unsuspecting guards on the back of the head with ASD and F.
In their latest real-time tactics-me-do Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, however, the act of quick saving has been woven directly into the language of the game, presented not as cold, hard button commands, but as &#x27;captured memories&#x27; that your magical ghost ship The Red Marley is able to unleash to make sure your supernatural pirate crew don&#x27;t get caught or die (again) on the job.

                              <span>MiHoYo have released Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s update, adding a new area, story elements, characters, domains and equipment to the gacha-driven free-to-play action RPG, which I remember having a lot of fun with last year. I&#x27;ve since inhaled a vast amount of shonen anime, and have accordingly been looking for a moment to reconnect with Genshin, one of the better anime games on the shop - perhaps this is it.


As Rebecca (RPS in peace, sob) wrote last week, Genshin Impact 4.0&#x27;s big new feature is the the sunken kingdom of Fontaine, which you can dive into after completing prologue mission Act III and unlocking the associated teleport waypoint in Sumeru. That&#x27;s literally dive into: Fontaine - not to be confused with the nice man from the Bronx you encounter in Bioshock - is water-themed, and there&#x27;s a new mechanic, Fontaine&#x27;s Blessing, which allows you to navigate local lakes, together with a Lucin Fountain system that can be levelled up for certain items.

Preliminary figures released by the Japanese Cabinet Officer today report that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may well have helped boost Japan&#x27;s GDP (gross domestic product), Japanese outlet Mainichi Shinbun reports. (via Forbes).
Nintendo&#x27;s highly-anticipated first-party title launched back in May 2023 and broke sales records all across the world, and it seems that those numbers have been reflected in Japan&#x27;s semi-durable goods sales — which include clothes, entertainment, and video games.

The game launches on 29th August on other consoles and PC, with the Switch version coming sometime in September — so it&#x27;s not a long wait, but it&#x27;s a wait nonetheless.

Note: The review text below makes only very brief mention of this game&#x27;s heavy themes without going into detail, but please note that this game contains references to suicide and self-harm.

The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is the latest gem from Deconstructeam (The Red Strings Club) and it’s a spellbinding narrative experience. Fitting into the deckbuilding genre in a very literal sense, this game follows the story of Fortuna, an exiled Witch who has been cast out into the cosmos by her own Coven.

                              <span>LG&#x27;s 27GN950 monitor is one of my all-time favourites, as it&#x27;s the perfect complement to a high-end gaming PC. You get a 4K resolution for pin-sharp graphics and text, a 144Hz refresh rate and Fast IPS panel for excellent motion handling, and a 27-inch span that fits easily onto a desk or monitor arm. After debuting at an eye-watering $800, this monitor has dropped on Amazon.com to a more reasonable $543.

                              <span>Being a reviewer during Big Game Season often feels like being chased through a massive, winding building in a serial killer movie (or possibly Until Dawn). You gallop shrieking and blundering round a corner and are confronted by a series of ominous doors with labels such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;. You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you&#x27;re commissioned to do a, haha, &quot;retrospective&quot; 10 years later.
This summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy 16&quot;, then spent a frantic moment trying to force the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot; door, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I&#x27;m mixing my scenarios - it&#x27;s the end of the day and I&#x27;m tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened. By far the grimmest and grandest of these is, of course, Diablo 4.

                              <span>Paradox have posted a Cities: Skylines 2 developer diary in which the studio discusses the new game&#x27;s rather elaborate-sounding economy simulation. This follows equally knotty breakdowns of its zoning tools, which allow you to mix architectural styles, and its road traffic system, which will hopefully dispense with some of the pathfinding issues from the original Cities: Skylines. In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.

                              <span>There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. 
Still. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.

                              <span>I have, for the past several weeks, been playing Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, the RPG equivalent of paying for ex-special forces lads to kidnap you at an unappointed day when you&#x27;re walking your labradoodle, and put you through a rigorous (pretend) interrogation schedule. Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it&#x27;s over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.
Hammerwatch 2 is out today, and it&#x27;s kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It&#x27;s like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as &quot;adorable&quot;, and it makes everything seem like it&#x27;s a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don&#x27;t want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn&#x27;t quite right and there&#x27;s some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.

                              <span>SPOILER WARNING FOR PEOPLE SENSITIVE TO SPOILERS. SPOILERS. I HAVE WARNED YOU. RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.
I met this really nice bard in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.
Anyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. &quot;Of course, we&#x27;d love to have you,&quot; I replied. What could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>Sclash is gorgeous. That&#x27;s not the reason I&#x27;m writing about it, but it definitely helps. Style can&#x27;t fix a bad game, but it can elevate a decent one about, say, a little hand-drawn 2D samurai running across the world stabbing dudes for peace. Little Jinmu does a lot of running to the right, a lot of slashing, and probably very little parrying and punching once you figure out the power attack.


There is, bluntly, not a lot to it, especially while its online mode is still listed as &quot;coming soon&quot;. But even with remote multiplayer, I see this as more of a diversion for friends to enjoy than a serious competitive fighter and intentionally so.


I enjoyed it though. Actually, I think I enjoyed it more for that, though it does perhaps limit its audience.

                              <span>This week I wrote a little post alerting you, my best friends, to the existence of Murdle. This weekend I went to town and bought a copy of the Murdle book - or, I should say, Volume 1, because you can already pre-order Volume 2. It&#x27;s a chunky enough tome made up of 100 of the puzzles that form Murdle&#x27;s daily little treat, split into sections of escalating difficulty. And, against my expectations, and despite basically being a vehicle for logic grid puzzles, Murdle has an actual plot. Which is more than many video games manage.

                              <span>I used to be into deserts, but ever since Kenshi I have become a swamp fangirl. I also consider nomadic cultures to be woefully under-represented in games. You&#x27;d think, then, that a game about a nomadic Iron Age people larking about in a horrible swamp would be made for me, but unfortunately, Gord is somehow both a game where you can feed a child to a forest-dwelling horror, and a game that&#x27;s kind of dull.
It&#x27;s the only memorable thing that happened, and I did it to save time. The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been itching to play The Lords Of The Fallen since I discovered that it&#x27;s a closet Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver homage (see my bio), with a sorcerous lantern that lets you switch between the living and unliving worlds of Axiom and Umbral. Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you&#x27;ll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.
You&#x27;re also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you&#x27;ll have to restart from one of the game&#x27;s Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I&#x27;m hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game&#x27;s many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.

                              <span>Comedy platformer Orbo&#x27;s Odyssey is a game about being locked in your boss&#x27;s office. Here are some things I might do if I were locked in my boss&#x27;s office (sorry Katharine): approve expense claims, sift their browser history for blackmail material and oh, who am I kidding, what I&#x27;d really do is perch on the desk, quiet as a churchmouse, waiting to be let out. Orbo&#x27;s boss keeps an... atypical office, however. It harbours product portals that take you to alternate worlds, hewn from the same seam of weirdness as Psychonauts.

                              <span>Bethesda have published a timeline detailing events in the Starfield universe from before the player&#x27;s arrival. The scrollable chronology, which runs from 2050 to 2160, charts the origins of the war between the United Colonies and Freestar Collective factions, who sound more and more to me like the Union and the Confederacy in the US Civil War. We&#x27;re also told about the formation of the Constellation organisation, a group of swashbuckling pioneers who are concerned with the origins of certain mystic Artifacts. And we get to read a little about a few key Starfield characters, such as space cowboy Sam Coe, careworn ex-soldier Sarah Morgan and sciencehunk Barrett. But the timeline also leaves plenty of mysteries. Join me, as I make a show of poking around in the collapsing space-museum with my tricorder.

                              <span>Star Wars is no stranger to video game adaptation. In fact, depending on your age, video games may be the primary way you interact with the far away galaxy from a long time ago. Outlaws, however, represent something new for the franchise, even if it isn’t new to video games. We’ve shot from the first-person perspective in Battlefront, explored labyrinthine, Metroid-inspired levels in Respawn’s Jedi games, and even commanded armies in Empire at War, but Outlaws is the first time we will explore an open Star Wars world.
Following a panel on the game at Comic-Con, we spoke with Outlaws&#x27; narrative director, Navid Khavari, over e-mail about a number of topics related to the game, including potential overlap with Shadows of the Empire, what exactly protagonist Kay Vess is going after, the fate o…</span>

The event airs at 9 a.m. Pacific/12 p.m. Eastern with an hour-long pre-show prior and a live post-show roundtable discussion. The Final Shape is a significant expansion for fans as it’s billed as the conclusion to the Light and Darkness Saga. That means everything that has occurred up to this point will culminate with this story. Speaking of which, Bungie released a new video recapping the biggest moments of the Destiny journey.


The showcase will also dive into Season 22, the next reprised raid, among other announcements. For more on Destiny 2, check out our review of its most recent expansion Lightfall, then read about how Keith David has been cast as the new voice of Commander Zavala.

                              <span>Remnant 2 is chugging along, and based on the reception so far, it has a long future ahead of it. Not only is the game a hit commercially and critically, but the development team is also addressing multiple pain points due to player feedback, which you always love to see. A patch was just released on PS5, and like most of the patches before it (on any platform), there&#x27;s a lot to unpack. Here are the big takeaways.
Crashes and trophies are fixed
Trophy/Achievement bugs are some of the most annoying glitches out there, especially if they only impact one or two seemingly small tasks. It&#x27;s not uncommon for AAA games to have a few bugged trophies, which can cause problems with the ever-present chase of Platinum status. Thankfully, this fix is retroactive, so your trophies should &quot;ding&quot; automati…</span>

                              <span>Forklift Interactive has launched Stage Games Inc’s production strategy game, Desynced, into Steam Early Access today.
Desynced is part automation game, part base-builder, and part RTS. You find yourself stranded on an unknown world and need to manufacture parts to repair your ship. You take command of a horde of drones that you use to extract resources and take them to various facilities to be processed. It bills itself as an “automation game without belts.” There’s a detailed system for programming your drones to work more autonomously, and you can also bring in other players for multiplayer.

Meanwhile, there is also an RTS aspect to Desynced, where you have to protect your factory. That seems like a worthwhile wrinkle to me since being able to diagnose and repair damage to your automated systems sounds pretty fantastic.
While the automated production genre has been seeing a lot of growth in the indie sphere over the last few years, I haven’t taken the dive yet. I’m not entirely sure why. For one thing, it’s a genre that can only really flourish outside of mainstream gaming, which is something I love. I also enjoy management games. I think I’m afraid of getting sucked in and finding myself having difficulty uncoupling when it comes time to play a game for work. That’s a pretty good problem to have.
Desynced is available for PC through Steam Early Access starting today. Stage Games is estimating that it will stay in Early Access for a year before reaching completion.

                              <span>HoYoverse announced via social media channels that two new characters will be coming to Genshin Impact: Wriothesley and Neuvillette.
What do we know about Wriothesley and Neuvillette?
Wriothesley (apparently pronounced “rizz-ly” or “rise-ly”) has a Cryo Vision and is the Lord of the Fortress of Meropide, which is some sort of prison at the bottom of the sea. He is Ousia-aligned; although his previous character art showed him with a Pneuma Vision shape, this was swiftly corrected. Aside from this, we know nothing about his weapon or kit, and will have to wait for further announcements to see how he plays.
Neuvillette is much more mysterious, with some of his information censored with triple question marks. We do know that he is the Chief Justice of Fontaine and some kind of father figure to the Melusines. He is likely very important to the main story in Genshin Impact, which would give a reason for all the secrecy. Neuvillette uses Hydro, but not through a Vision. What exactly he is and how he uses his powers are a great mystery, possibly with answers in upcoming Archon Quests.

When are Wriothesley and Neuvillette coming to Genshin Impact?
Drip marketing like this usually comes in two versions before the characters are released. This means we can expect Wriothesley and Neuvillette sometime in Version 4.1 of Genshin Impact. Whether they will be in the first half or second remains to be seen, along with who will accompany their banners. 
If you are interested in either of these characters, you may want to start saving Primogems now.

                              <span>We all remember the Adoring Fan from The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. He was – let&#x27;s not mince words here – a monstrously irritating NPC, and now someone taken that monstrosity and actualized it in physical form.
Over on Nexus Mods, user theocddragon simply asks &quot;good heavens what have I done&quot; with a modification for Oblivion that turns everyone&#x27;s favorite Wood Elf to hate into an unholy sight. Seriously, it&#x27;s like if the Adoring Fan was rejected from Tim Burton&#x27;s Beetlejuice for being too odd.

Editing the character model, the modder has reconstructing the NPC&#x27;s face using a dragging tool that has resulted in the severely morphed image of this once annoying–though wholly innocent–citizen of Cyrodiil.
Kill it with three fires
Describing it as an &quot;eldritch abomination with one singular eye,&quot; theocddragon has unleashed a nightmare unto the Oblivion community and those who witness it. They even question why someone would be able to wield such power in editing software.
It kind of reminds me of the pre-menu screen in Super Mario 64, in which – perhaps in a bid to show the power of the N64 console – you could stretch and morph Mario&#x27;s face. It, too, produced some horrifying images that are not of this world.
That aside, it does show just how beloved Oblivion in the community, even after 17 years. The Bethesda RPG has definitely aged as time has gone by, but that&#x27;s where Skyblivion comes into the picture.
This is a fan-made project that will be a complete remake of TES4 done in Skyrim&#x27;s engine. As such, we&#x27;ll get a much prettier (though perhaps not visually up-to-date) version of Oblivion. Let&#x27;s just hope the Adoring Fan will not be the facial atrocity he is in theocddrago&#x27;s mod.

                              <span>To put everything I’m about to say into context, I don’t know if anyone has anticipated Hammerwatch 2 as much as I have.
The original Hammerwatch, released in 2013 by Crackshell, was the co-op indie game I played for months. It was a Gauntlet-style dungeon crawler with distinct character classes, lite RPG elements, and neat mod support. It’s a short game that you can clear in under four hours, but I got so much replay value out of it in part thanks to Crackshell’s ongoing support. Heck, it got an entirely new campaign, Temple of the Sun, as free DLC. Steam says I put over 40 hours into this one.
Meanwhile, 2018&#x27;s Heroes of Hammerwatch remixed the original game’s assets into a Roguelite structure. Man did I put hours into this one. Heroes took that arcadey co-op fun from the original and ga…</span>

                              <span>Many of us horror fans are giddy about the fact that Silent Hill is making a comeback. However, the loss of P.T. (the SH project that was being developed by Hideo Kojima and Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro) will always be a sore point. Not just for fans, either, as even those involved still feel the pain.
Recently, people on Twitter have acknowledged the nine years that have elapsed since P.T. was released. Many have been reminiscing about what could have been before the game was canceled in 2015. One such person is del Toro himself, who reached out to Konami, seemingly in a bid to see if the studio is interested in reviving the dead project.

There&#x27;s not much that&#x27;s been said by the director other than asking Konami, &quot;What sayeth thou?&quot; This was followed by the phrase &quot;Irrumabo Konamitus&quot; which, when translated from Latin to English, says &quot;I will visit Konami.&quot;
Don&#x27;t let your P.T.s be dreams
It sounds like del Toro is very much interested in reviving P.T. 
Given that Silent Hill is making a triumphant return, hopes will remain that Kojima&#x27;s take on the series will one day count itself among the many other upcoming SH games. It&#x27;s hard to say. Konami pretty much turned its back on the franchise (and on Hideo Kojima) several years ago. Whether the studio will ever return to this one particular project cannot be said.
It&#x27;s also hard to imagine it&#x27;s been nearly ten years since P.T. dropped on PS4 with nary a word. Its photorealistic visuals, Kojima-esque puzzles, and terrifying atmosphere made it stand out. The fact that it was eventually revealed to be a teaser for the now-defunct Silent Hills was even more thrilling.
Such a shame it never came to be. Perhaps del Toro&#x27;s words will open up a new dialogue of possibilities. Ah, to dream.

                              <span>With just a few weeks left, everyone and their dog is talking about Starfield (if &quot;woof&quot; is canine-speak for &quot;I&#x27;m really looking forward to Starfield&quot;). Before then, we&#x27;re still being drip-fed bite-sized bits of information, including the story prior to the game itself.
Over on the developer&#x27;s website, you can scroll down to a timeline of the major political events that take place before we join things. It begins in the year 2050, when humans take their first steps on Mars.
Just 50 years later, we begin living in space. Then, after just a few more years, we reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to Earth (about 4.3 light years away from us).
https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1691105607712202752
After that, the timeline gives a brief rundown of the main events that occur before Starfield kicks off. For example, there&#x27;s a little bit of information about the United Colonies, the settling of some of the major cities, some wars. All that good stuff.
We&#x27;ve truly left Earth behind
The timeline ends when Starfield begins. At this point, we can&#x27;t really say what will happen in the story. All we can safely say is that we&#x27;ll likely be playing a big part in it. It&#x27;s also quite optimistic of Bethesda to say that humanity will be able to step on our nearest planet in less than 30 years. I mean, it is possible, but who knows what the future of real-life space travel will be?
That&#x27;s why we have science fiction. At least this way we can jump into the moon boots of those who will be exploring faraway galaxies while, back here on Earth, many of us are still wondering what the hell Threads even is.
Starfield launches on September 6 for PC and Xbox Series X|S. It&#x27;ll also be available on Game Pass from day one.

                              <span>Another Japan-exclusive Famicom game has received new life thanks to fans. 1990’s Dai Kaiju Deburas has received a fan translation patch, turning it into the Anglophonic Giant Monster Flaburas.
Video games have a history of not treating kaiju very well. That’s partially because Japan kept most of the good ones and left us with games like Godzilla for NES or Godzilla for PS4. Dai Kaiju Deburas is a unique take on the genre by focusing more on strategy. You don’t play as the monster itself. Instead, you’re the military, and you’re trying to defend an egg while it’s transported across Japan.
It’s kind of like 1991’s Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters for NES. However, Dai Kaiju Deburas is less of a chore to play.
I actually own this game for Famicom, so I’m happy to see it finally get a translation. There’s a decent amount of text that makes it hard to play if you don’t speak English. My Japanese reading skill got me through a few missions, but I wound up putting it aside and never getting back to it. I had planned on playing it for my old Famicom Friday column, but it kind of fell by the wayside. I’ve even got a picture of it on my Mickey TV. Here you go:
[caption id&#x3D;&quot;attachment_396649&quot; align&#x3D;&quot;alignnone&quot; width&#x3D;&quot;640&quot;] Image by Destructoid[/caption]
Whether you love kaiju, are looking for something new, or just like a decent turn-based strategy game, Dai Kaiju Deburas is worth a look. You can find the patch for it right over here.

Nejedná se o klasický formát meetupu, jako dříve, ale jde spíše o neformální diskuzi mezi účastníky. Tématem jsou „screw-ups“, můžete tedy povědět to co se vám úplně nezdařilo a chcete o tom diskutovat s dalšími účastníky.</span>

Don&#x27;t worry - you can pick up Arctic&#x27;s popular MX-4 compound thermal paste for $5.56 today and it comes with a tiny spatula, perfect for ensuring full coverage even on modern extra-large processors like Intel&#x27;s 12th/13th-gen chips, AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 chips and even workstation-class products like ThreadRipper.

                              <span>IO Interactive have found such success with Hitman over the past decade that it&#x27;s hard to imagine the developer making anything else, but I have many vivid memories of its non-Agent-47-centric outings. 2010&#x27;s Kane &amp; Lynch 2 was a very special breed of spiritual ugliness, while 2003&#x27;s Freedom Fighters wowed youngling me with its chunky urban squad tactics. I also have a soft spot for Mini Ninjas, one of IO&#x27;s few jaunts into the realm of family-friendliness, if only because as somebody familiar with IO&#x27;s other work, I could smell the blood beneath its bloodless Nickleodeon visuals.
I&#x27;m keen to hear more of the studio&#x27;s forthcoming James Bond adaptation, unveiled in 2020 - surely a marriage made in franchising heaven, though I struggle to imagine an IO protagonist quipping like 007. But I&#x27;m especially eager to lay eyes on its currently untitled Project Fantasy, an online RPG inspired by &quot;the togetherness, camaraderie, agony, and delight&quot; of table-top gaming and more specifically, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone&#x27;s Fighting Fantasy books.

That&#x27;s a surprisingly awesome deal and would make the perfect beginnings of a high-end rig, with just a GPU, CPU cooler, SSD, PSU and case needed for a complete build - many of which you may want to bring over from your existing PC.

                              <span>If you can believe it, we first wrote about Small Saga, the retro-flavoured turn-based RPG filled with penknife-wielding rodents and fireballs cast from cigarette lighters, a little over four years ago. Clearly inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy - albeit crossed with the ‘small animals on a big adventure’ feel of Brian Jacques&#x27; Redwall novels - it looked absolutely brilliant. That sentiment was only solidified by its Steam Next Fest demo last year, which left Katharine impressed by its compelling combat and rodent fantasy setting. It’s been quite the journey for the indie RPG, but we won’t have to wait much longer to see what Small Saga has to offer in full, as it finally has a release date.

                              <span>For all the big-budget GeForce graphics cards, it’s the firmly mainstream XX60 models that must surely keep the lights on at Nvidia HQ. A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.
The RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.

                              <span>In the picturesque Regency town of Leamington Spa, a debutante has entered the local high society of AAA game developers. Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”


One of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.

If you&#x27;re new to the much-imitated Vampire Survivors format, the idea is to steer an auto-attacking character around a map that is slowly invaded by increasingly hazardous waves of foes, levelling up as you go. Think of it as a bullet hell shooter, but set to the tune of a walking sim. At first, anyway: at higher levels, Vampire Survivors is a perfectly withering experience, for all its initial glacial pace.

                              <span>Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you&#x27;re unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski&#x27;s first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don&#x27;t half move around in this industry.
I never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski&#x27;s follow-up remark that he&#x27;d like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.

                              <span>Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic&#x27;s highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM&#x27;s Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they&#x27;re both on 97, but I&#x27;m guessing the &quot;score distillation&quot; arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian&#x27;s new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.


It&#x27;s a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&amp;D adaptations ever set to code. It&#x27;s also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you&#x27;ve likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today&#x27;s &quot;triple-A games&quot;, aka &quot;biggest/shiniest&quot;. Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall &quot;quality&quot;. A few people go into specifics: I&#x27;ve read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.

A Michigan district court found Sven Hansche liable for 748 violations of copyright law and was guided on damages awarded in lawsuits against IPTV providers Nitro TV and Area 51.

                              <span>BREIN is systematically taking down pirate IPTV services, especially those that cater to Dutch consumers. The anti-piracy group recently closed the books on a multi-year case against the once-largest IPTV service in the Netherlands. While the matter had a successful outcome, it took multiple trips to court to wrap things up neatly.

Nicméně stejný autor Boris Petkov přišel s tím, že původní oprava není dostatečná. Nestačí přidávat dělení nulou jen při obsluze výjimky, protože kvůli spekulaci mohou stejně data utéci.</span>

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage is one of the most anticipated games of 2023, and after years of rumors and delays, its release date is still just out of reach. However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they&#x27;re done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.

The game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020&#x27;s Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.
In an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it&#x27;s a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with &quot;other RPGs,&quot; which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage&#x27;s new date doesn&#x27;t seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.

                              <span>To The Core is, to borrow its Steam description, &quot;an incremental game about extracting and using resources from planets to buy upgrades.&quot; That&#x27;s pretty much it. I&#x27;ve played it for eight hours since buying it yesterday, hooked by a progression curve that takes you from an ineffectual mining ship chipping at a single planet&#x27;s rocky surface until you explode, to the leader of a swarm of bomb-dropping drones and aerial bombardment lasers that can travel a solar system and devour any planet to its core in seconds.

It&#x27;s part idle game, part Vampire Survivors, and it&#x27;s out now.

So far, so Opus Magnum. The twist is that your only resource is a sans-serif letter &quot;I&quot;, which you&#x27;re manipulating and combining to make every other letter in the alphabet - and, in turn, to construct whole words to complete each level. It&#x27;s out now.

The newly announced South Park: Snow Day is taking a different approach, rendering Cartman and its world in 3D for a four-player co-op action game. It&#x27;s also being developed by first-person indie darlings Question. You&#x27;ll find the trailer below.

                              <span>In a turn up for the big embossed fantasy tomes, this week while we&#x27;re all still sort of kicking about Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, we&#x27;re also starting to return to the real world a bit.

                              <span>In 2022, rightsholders obtained permission in Austria to block several pirate site domains and a list of IP addresses that actually belonged to Cloudflare. ISPs had no choice but to comply with the court&#x27;s instructions which took out countless Cloudflare customers in Austria. According to reviews conducted by local telecoms regulator TKK, the IP address blocking violated net neutrality regulations and will no longer be allowed.

                              <span>During today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, we learned about a new game starring everyone&#x27;s favorite raunchy Colorado kids. South Park: Snow Day looks to carry on the series&#x27; legacy of over-the-top and mature-rated humor while still viewing life through the eyes of children. 
Starring the core group of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, players take part in celebrations surrounding the magical occasion of a snow day. Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.


We don&#x27;t have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia. In the past, the studio has worked on The Blackout Club and The Magic Circle. South Park: Snow Day! is set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC in 2024.</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven&#x27;t heard much since then, today&#x27;s THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.
In the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. &quot;Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.&quot;


According to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn&#x27;t currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Super Replay returns, and we&#x27;re checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts!  Released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008, the third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare&#x27;s beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will we land on it? Let&#x27;s find out. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore one of the Xbox 360&#x27;s biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 is off to a pretty great start in terms of its, thus far, glowing reception and player engagement. Developer Larian Studios has released a fun infographic accumulating player data gathered from the game’s first weekend, and the results are a mix of surprising, amusing, and flat-out staggering.
Last weekend, you played 1225 years of Baldur’s Gate 3. As we head into the second weekend of launch, we’ve compiled some tasty stats for you to sink your teeth into.

August 11, 2023
You can view the fun infographic in the embedded tweet above, but we’ve summarized each bullet point below:
368 players finished the game during the opening weekend.
Over 93% of players rolled a custom character
Players spent a combined 88 years in character creation
Nearly 10% of characters spent at least one hour in character creation
Gale was the most popular Origin character selected at 27,784 players
Gale was the 7th cause of death for players
Paladin was the most popular class choice at over 200K players
Half-Elf was the most popular race choice at over 250K players (barely edging out Human at 2nd and Elf at 3rd)
Almost 100,000 players have been rejected by Astarion (Shadowheart was the most popular romance option, followed by Gale)
One NPC was shoved into a chasm for every concurrent player during peak engagement on Sunday (815,000 players)
12% of player deaths were caused by friendly fire
65.1% of players saved Emerald Grove
Scratch has been petted over 750,000 times
Players spoke to over 1,400,000 corpses and over 2,400,000 animals
Players have played at least 10,000,000 hours (over 1,225 years)
Needless to say, a lot of players appear to be having a great time with Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, and we look forward to seeing how these stats evolve over time, especially once the PlayStation 5 version launches next month. Stay tuned to Game Informer for our impending review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and let us know what you think of the game in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, the mobile RPG retelling the FFVII saga, finally has a release date. The game was first announced in February 2021. 
Ever Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.


This will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.</span>

                              <span>Airhead is one of those platformers I really want to like. Freshly announced at tonight&#x27;s THQ Nordic Showcase, I&#x27;ve been playing an early, hour-long demo build of it this week, and while there are certainly things to admire here, I&#x27;m not overly convinced it&#x27;s going to be one for the ages. Its colourful visuals and contrasting colour palette cast its deep caverns and sun-drenched mountains in a beautiful, but eerie kind of light, and its strange, scuttling creatures put me in the mind of the night horrors from Dredge and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet. But its central premise of you being a headless body carting round an inflatable head to presumably escape to goodness knows where isn&#x27;t quite the breath of fresh air I hoped it would be.

You don&#x27;t have long to give it a pop - it will disappear on August 28th - but this base-building RTS harks back to the C&amp;C days of yore with its diverse set of units and industrial metal soundtrack. I played a version of this demo earlier in the year and had a great time with it, so it&#x27;s worth seeking out over the weekend if you get a spare moment.

                              <span>THQ Nordic have announced Titan Quest 2, a sequel to Iron Lore Entertainment&#x27;s action RPG of 2006, which was kind of a classical variation on Diablo with players touring Ancient Greece, Egypt and China in search of chthonic beasts to slay. The new game is the work of Grimlore Games, creator of Spellforce III and one of THQ Nordic&#x27;s first internal development studios. It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.

                              <span>THQ Nordic and Appeal Studios have semi-re-announced Outcast 2: A New Beginning as plain old Outcast: A New Beginning, having sensibly decided that positioning it as a sequel to a 24-year-old game might turn younger audiences away. In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.
In Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You&#x27;re here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can&#x27;t argue with the verticality and agility on display.

                              <span>Way back in the dingy darkness of 1997 I played a property management sim called Constructor, in which you could do things like bury rivals in their own cement, and have your foreman take down the other guy&#x27;s hooligans with a shotgun. I&#x27;ve never played any property sim that&#x27;s quite as nasty, but I do get a similar vibe from Mirage Game Studios&#x27; Space For Sale, published by THQ Nordic, in which one or two players throw together budget rentals for aliens on a decidedly unfriendly planet. We caught a glimpse of it at a presentation a few days ago, and despite my better nature I am keen to dig in.

Specifically, pastures that have had the letters and numbers VG247 mown into them, as Rebecca is beginning a new guides journey at our dear sister site starting next week. We wish her all the best in her new adventures, follicking in the fields of Animal Crossing and other console-based delights, although I&#x27;ll personally be very sad to lose my fellow Zero Escape and Danganronpa liker (the placement of these games in next year&#x27;s RPS 100 is now in serious trouble, folks, I&#x27;m telling ya now). But before we get too deep in the doom and gloom, come and bid her farewell in the comments below.

It will tell you how fast it runs games, how hot it gets, how it compares to Nvidia’s RTX 4060 and suchlike. What I can’t explain with it, admittedly, is why the RX 7600 exists.

I met another player who likes rolling rangers at a D&amp;D table earlier this week, and I actually high-fived her because I was so excited at my one-woman ranger defense squad doubling its membership. Making your character a ranger in BG3 (which has some very slight differences) is even better; you can essentially brew a rogue that is better at taking damage, but can still do most other things you traditionally use a rogue for. Let me explain.

                              <span>One thing I never tire of ranting about is the brilliance of the original Homeworld Mothership - both for its elegant crescent-moon design, and for its more practical function as a giant compass needle shoved into Homeworld&#x27;s then-unprecedented 3D volumes, so that players can orient themselves and strategise. I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3&#x27;s redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s. But I&#x27;ve come round to the new Mothership after reading Blackbird Interactive art director Karl Gryc&#x27;s thoughts on its creation.

Imagine my shock when searching for Murdle on the site this morning returned no results. This is the RPS dep ed version of saying you can&#x27;t find the big scissors without looking in the kitchen drawer first.
Murdle is a free daily logic puzzle game that you can play in-browser at murdle.com. They&#x27;re like luxury versions of those ones you&#x27;d get in thick, half-sized paperbacks from WH Smiths, next to the books of sudoku, where you have to figure out who lives in which house and what colour their car is with clues like &#x27;Peter does not not have a four-wheeled drive. Murdle is better, though, because the puzzles are themed around being a detective - or, technically, a Deductive - called Logico solving a murder. You get a new one every day, and it&#x27;s neat-o.

                              <span>AMD and Bethesda have unveiled a limited-edition Starfield-themed Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU and Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU at Quakecon 2023. Both are decorated according to the forthcoming open world space-me-do&#x27;s &quot;NASApunk&quot; aesthetic, a blend of cool whites, blues and yellows which I will admit to finding rather attractive, as somebody who generally finds gaming hardware aesthetics an absolute turn-off. It&#x27;s certainly better-looking than Nvidia&#x27;s lurid Cyberpunk 2077 GPU from 2020, but if you&#x27;re similarly beguiled, there&#x27;s an unfortunate catch: only 500 of these GPU/CPU sets are being made, and they&#x27;re exclusively available as part of a Quakecon giveaway.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who&#x27;ve already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an &quot;Overwhelmingly Negative&quot; rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game&#x27;s direction and faults.


Many players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2&#x27;s switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2&#x27;s story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard&#x27;s recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard&#x27;s alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch&#x27;s emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.

According to his attorney, the operator ran out of money so is unable to fund a legal battle in a foreign court. As a result, the $83 million DMCA circumvention verdict stands.

After concluding that DISH has no standing to sue, DataCamp revealed details of private settlement talks and the prospect of a &quot;scam judgment.&quot; Interestingly, settlement negotiations are suddenly back on.

Still, these freebies are on top of the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for the fastest gaming CPU on the market, making this a deal that&#x27;s well worth your time if you&#x27;re considering a new gaming rig.

                              <span>Asus has some of the best industrial designers in the PC space, and that&#x27;s normally best appreciated on their laptops and motherboards. However, the Taiwanese company also produces some great PC cases, such as the subject of today&#x27;s deals post: the ROG Z11 Mini ITX. This small form factor case comes in a beautiful tower style with impressive front I/O and a tilted motherboard tray that enhances airflow. It&#x27;s a cool, funky little case and well worth considering at its reduced price of £99.98, down from its original UK RRP of £240.

It&#x27;s very good. But if you&#x27;re one of the many who haven&#x27;t, the premise is thus: an ancient evil has, as ancient evil is wont to do, arisen once more to threaten the great walled city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate, and by extension the surrounds, and by further extension the world and all the deep gnomes, elves and sexy demon wizards therein. Through happenstance and literal brainworms, you and the band of strange adventurers you meet in the first act are the only ones who can save the day. Don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t need to remember or have played Baldur&#x27;s Gate 1 or 2. So. Off you go, then.

                              <span>Surprising few but delighting many, id Software and Bethesda have released a Quake 2 remaster to inaugurate this year&#x27;s Quakecon. An enhanced edition of the 1997 game, it includes the mission packs The Reckoning and Ground Zero alongside a PC version of Quake 2 on N64. All that for £8 or $10, plus a brand new expansion titled Call of the Machine, developed by Wolfenstein: The New Order studio MachineGames.
While not as beloved or enduring as its predecessor or successor, Quake 2 is one of the Grand Old Shooters. I recall being introduced to it at a covert LAN party in a school IT room, plonking myself down at a monitor and instantly being reduced to a fine red mist (and in the game, etc). The singleplayer campaign had you scrapping across a muddy alien world with shotgun and hyperblaster, with larger levels than in the original Quake, and missions where you&#x27;d use heads as keys.

                              <span>Had you asked me yesterday about the best Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 class, I might have picked Bard - versatile, swish, a solid support both in and out of combat - but that was before I discovered the ancient and honourable Larian discipline of barrelmancy. As the name suggests, it&#x27;s all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.
A straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it&#x27;s possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur&#x27;s Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they&#x27;re perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.

We&#x27;re discussing current things about old things this week, as Bayonetta man Hideki Kamiya reveals he&#x27;s not super fond of the term &#x27;retro&#x27; when applied to games. We discuss his comments, and what retro even means anyway, as well as what kind of games count as retro. Who even knows? Definitions are a jail, man.

In this full release, there are now three episodes in total, all with new guns, enemies and the like. There&#x27;s also a multiplayer mode and mod support to round things off. All of this begs the question: does its 1.0 release cling onto its Bestest Best badge?

                              <span>I can feel all my Cool Culture Critic points dribbling out of my ears as I type this, but I&#x27;ve never actually watched Twin Peaks, David Lynch&#x27;s acclaimed paranormal smalltown TV show. The nearest I&#x27;ve come to doing so is that one episode of the Simpsons. The major things I am given to understand about it are that it is very confusing, sexy in a ghoulish way, and 100% comprised of memes in the same way that Hamlet has retrospectively become a book&#x27;s worth of quotations.
I have, however, played a surprising number of very decent games that are influenced by Twin Peaks - Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening, Silent Hill and the amazing Lone Survivor, to pick a few that I know about for sure. So who knows, perhaps I won&#x27;t be utterly bamfoodled and confluzzled by Twin Peaks: Into The Night, an unofficial PS1-style adaptation of the game that has just surfaced on Itch.

                              <span>Lords Of The Fallen is a curious sequel/reboot of the 2014 Lords Of The Fallen. It takes the Soulslike credentials of the original, gives them a grittier makeover, a much bigger world, and a magical lantern that reveals a gnarlier version of the universe you can actually step into.
Having spent roughly 90-minutes with the game, I&#x27;d say it has strong Dark Souls 2 energy mixed with a realm-hopping gimmick that&#x27;s surprisingly impressive. While it&#x27;s definitely too early to make big claims, I could see LOTF as a genuine competitor in the saturated Soulslike arena.

All that changes with Modern Warfare 3, however, which brings across a &quot;vast amount&quot; of content from Modern Warfare 2, including guns, attachments and cosmetics.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game&#x27;s handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren&#x27;t fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. 


Starfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda&#x27;s Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between &quot;local time&quot;, corresponding to where you land on a planet&#x27;s surface, and &quot;UT&quot;, which sounds like an abbreviation of &quot;universal time&quot;, and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There&#x27;s footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there&#x27;s the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.

                              <span>Earlier this year, Destiny 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn (among many other roles) actor Lance Reddick passed away unexpectedly. In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.
Today, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).
He has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint&#x27;s Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.
In the post on Bungie&#x27;s site announcing the casting, David said, &quot;I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character&#x27;s sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.&quot;</span>

                              <span>To say that Overwatch 2 has had a rough start to its lifecycle would be an understatement. After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game&#x27;s lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game&#x27;s structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions. However, with Season 6, titled Invasion, the Overwatch 2 development team is making huge strides to release a content drop absolutely jam-packed with new modes, new maps, and even a new support hero. Following my exclusive look at Overwatch 2&#x27;s Toronto Story Mission back in June, I was once again invited to go hands-on with Overwatch 2: Invasion – this time, with the entire Invasion update.

The first Lords of the Fallen released in 2014, a time when From Software’s Dark Souls series consisted of two games. Bloodborne wasn’t out, and Elden Ring hadn’t yet redefined what the action-RPG genre can be. Lords of the Fallen was among the first Soulslikes to appear on my radar. It didn’t hit for me and I put it down after a few hours. It was slow, clunky, and allowed for little wiggle room in gameplay style. I yearned for the flexibility of Dark Souls’ various classes and the speed some of them allowed.

                              <span>Záplaty zmírňující dopad chyby Downfall na výkon procesorů Intel je obvykle ve vyšších jednotkách procent, někdy překročí 10% hranici výrazněji. Alespoň tolik vyplývá z prvotních testů webu Phoronix, který stav před a po záplatách otestoval na platformě se dvěma 40jádrovými Xeon Platinum 8380 (generace Ice Lake z roku 2021) a Xeon Gold 6226R (16jádrový Cascade Lake z roku 2020).</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s not just me - NVMe SSD prices have gotten absolutely wild recently, right? Today we spotted a deal on the 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus, formerly one of the very fastest SSDs on the market. It normally retails for $100, but today it&#x27;s down to an even more incredible $74 at Amazon - not bad for a drive that originally retailed at $500 and cost $100 more in January!

                              <span>If I could distill Atlas Fallen I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s like going to a video game store, rifling through the pre-owned shelves, and selecting a purchase based purely off what&#x27;s most likely to deliver an average-to-good time. Bulky pauldrons and a glowy blue gauntlet? Perfect. Set your expectations low and you&#x27;ve got a game with genuinely great fights against dusty crabs, mixed with acceptable open world-ish fetch quests. Just don&#x27;t ever let your expectations rise, otherwise frustrations with some of its jank might tip you over the edge... and you might realise there&#x27;s plenty else you could play.

Created in collaboration with Keiko Pope, the resulting browser-based LCD, Please &quot;runs&quot; on a mocked-up LCD console, akin to Nintendo&#x27;s Game &amp; Watch. Pope is also celebrating the anniversary by donating $100,000 to the International Rescue Committee.
The demake gives you the simplified strokes of the celebrated 2013 game: you&#x27;re a border control officer, approving or denying entry to the fictional country of Arstotzka, which boils down to checking mugshots and bios against faces that, in this rendition, call to mind Rorschach blots. The representation of an LCD screen with &quot;baked-in&quot; graphics is impressive - I had to fight the urge to tilt my computer to catch the sunlight while playing.

                              <span>As a liker, consumer and person who used to work in print media, I always get a thrill out of seeing things like books in games, DVD shelves, magazines, you name it. If it&#x27;s a bit of video game set dressing that has a legible spine with words on it, I will absolutely scrutinise it to the nth degree. Videoverse, the excellent homage to early 00s internet forums and Nintendo&#x27;s Miiverse that came out earlier this week, doesn&#x27;t have spine-filled book shelves, per se, but throughout the game you will see a collection of game magazines piling up on Emmett&#x27;s desk, and readers, let me tell you, they are a delight.

                              <span>Scan the cast list for Stray Gods and you may notice a fair bit of overlap with that of The Last Of Us. Both Troy Baker (Joel) and Ashley Johnson (Ellie) appear in key supporting roles here, while star billing goes to Laura Bailey, aka Abby from Naughty Dog’s sequel. Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this &#x27;roleplaying musical&#x27; is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode &#x27;Once More With Feeling&#x27;, you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.
Thankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.

                              <span>I&#x27;m still stupidly early on in my Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 journey - I did, after all, spend several hours replaying the start to see how different origin characters worked - but last night I had my first real run-in up at the chapel near where you crash land in the big nautiloid. I&#x27;d played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.
Sensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn&#x27;t bear to part with everything I&#x27;d picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn&#x27;t move. And in my early hours of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone&#x27;s swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be...

                              <span>The latest Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch is out, and all anybody will talk about are the buggy invisible gnome underpants and the penises clipping through clothing. Larian themselves highlighted it in their patch notes, and the socials have predictably gone wild with talk of girthy githyankis. Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I&#x27;d like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.


Tear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you&#x27;ll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They&#x27;ve also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they&#x27;re on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping. See, this is the stuff video game news is rightly made of. None of your adolescent leering, thanks.

                              <span>You might already know that first-person fantasy RPG Avowed began life as Obsidian&#x27;s take on Skyrim, but did you know that it was originally pushed as a multiplayer game, prior to being acquired by Microsoft? That&#x27;s according to studio head and founder Feargus Urquhart, speaking in the latest and final episode of the Obsidian 20th Anniversary documentary, which is chock-a-block with intriguing factoids from throughout the studio&#x27;s history.


&quot;One of the things I really pushed was that Avowed was going to be multiplayer,&quot; Urquhart said. &quot;And I kept on that for a long time. And I think in the end - not &#x27;I think&#x27;, I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you&#x27;re asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting. It was this idea of sort of the peanut butter and chocolate, putting it together - it must be something that&#x27;s good.&quot;

                              <span>Rockstar&#x27;s original Red Dead Redemption can seem rather humble next to the rootin&#x27; tootin&#x27; excellence of Red Dead Redemption 2, but it looms larger in my memory, albeit not for the best reasons. The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. 
I saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.

While that never happened, action against Sdarot has now reached boiling point; international raids, server seizures, and a full-blown lawsuit in Israel targeting 14 people. And a site that remains up and taunting its rivals.

                              <span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III was recently announced to launch in November, and a new trailer teases its antagonist: Makarov. The final big bad from the original Modern Warfare trilogy is back in full force, which means bad news for Task Force 141. 
Older fans know him as Vladimir Makarov, the side antagonist in 2009&#x27;s Modern Warfare 2 and the primary threat in 2011’s MW3. He’s set to take that head villain mantle once again in the third entry of the rebooted trilogy, and a trailer appropriately paints him as the boogeyman set to make Captain Price and Co.’s lives a living hell. The trailer also teases a full reveal of the game on August 17.


Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III is set to release on November 10.</span>

I&#x27;m a fan of musicals of all kinds. From Hamilton to La La Land to Bob&#x27;s Burgers, if the characters in your story burst into song, I&#x27;m more than likely on board. For this exact reason, Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical caught my eye, exciting both my inner fan of musicals and my inner fan of games. Despite some complaints about glitches and awkward songwriting in a few places, developer Summerfall Studios harmonizes these concepts well, putting on a show I can&#x27;t help but applaud.

                              <span>In 2022, MindGeek subsidiary MG Premium prevailed in its legal battle against the operator of Daftsex and several other pirate sites. MG was awarded $32m in damages and permission to seize domain names but to date, nothing has been paid, and the sites are still in business. Mindful that his injunction is being ignored, a U.S. judge has just held the persistent pirate in contempt of court and declared MG Premium the new owner of his pirate domains.

                              <span>Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. 
I&#x27;ve been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction&#x27;s reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There&#x27;s only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.

                              <span>I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur&#x27;s Gate 2 playthrough). I&#x27;ve just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they&#x27;re standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&amp;D player handbook. 
These feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to &quot;alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires&quot;, up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it&#x27;s far from certain that they&#x27;ll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There&#x27;s a good reason for this: higher level D&amp;D spells and abilities are so potent it&#x27;s hard to include them without turning Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 characters into gods.

                              <span>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&amp;D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There&#x27;s one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.

                              <span>The curious journey of Ironmace&#x27;s medieval extraction sim Dark And Darker continues with the launch of an early access build. You won&#x27;t find it in one of the usual places, however. As Kaan reported in April, Dark And Darker was pulled from Steam following accusations of copyright theft from publisher Nexon (Ironmace&#x27;s founder Terence Park and a developer Ju-Hyun Choi are Nexon alumni who worked on a similar fantasy game, codenamed P3, in 2020-2021). With legal proceedings on-going, Ironmace have released this tense first-person dungeon crawler via their own Blacksmith launcher and third-party store Chaf Games. It&#x27;s a bit more ceremonial than letting people torrent the test builds, at least.

                              <span>For composer Austin Wintory, Stray Gods started with a rejected pitch.
Five years ago, when he was invited to a pre-GDC meeting to pitch game ideas to an unnamed friend, Wintory had one that really excited him. It was a musical game – not just a game with musical numbers distributed throughout, but where the player has control over the music itself. Wintory&#x27;s friend was less than enthusiastic.
&quot;He said very graciously, but in no uncertain terms, &#x27;I hate that idea, and I want nothing to do with that,&#x27;&quot; Wintory recalls. He smiles as he tells the story, finding humor in the irony that this rejected pitch eventually became the game I&#x27;m currently interviewing him about.
While his unnamed friend wasn&#x27;t interested, he did point Wintory towards Liam Esler, a developer with similar ambitions for fi…</span>

                              <span>Today&#x27;s Pokémon Presents gave us lots of updates on upcoming Pokémon titles, like Detective Pikachu Returns, the classic games coming to Switch Online, and even new raids for Mewtwo in Scarlet and Violet. However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here&#x27;s everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.


We knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you&#x27;ll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…</span>

                              <span>If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.
Developer Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,
“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”
While it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they&#x27;ll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. 
WrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.
WresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.</span>

                              <span>Detective Pikachu Returns got a new trailer during this morning’s Pokemon Presents, running down the cast of characters and pocket monsters you’ll encounter during your investigations.
Our chatty electric rodent is, of course, joined by his human partner Tim Goodman. The trailer also reacquaints us with Tim’s family, his friend Rachel and her major father, along with some of the Pokémon lending a helpful hand like the clue-sniffing Growlithe. The trailer also shows off some of the investigative gameplay.


Detective Pikachu Returns arrives on Switch on October 6. For our thoughts on the first game, check out our review here.</span>

                              <span>Two of the most popular Pokémon arrive in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#x27;s Paldea region through limited-time events. Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.
Beginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password &quot;GETYOURMEW&quot; before September 18. Each Mew&#x27;s Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon&#x27;s flexible capabilities. You&#x27;ll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.
The second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you&#x27;re able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect &quot;something special.&quot;
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.


During the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions.

                              <span>Two classic Pokémon games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today in the form of Pokémon Trading Card Game and Pokémon Stadium 2. Both will be available later today.
Pokémon Trading Card Game was released for the GameBoy in 1998 and has a similar format to the traditional RPG series, except you&#x27;re battling with cards instead of actual monsters. Pokémon Stadium 2 arrived in the U.S. for the Nintendo 64 in 2001 and is, obviously, the sequel to the first Stadium, which is already available on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. 
While these aren&#x27;t the much-requested Red/Blue/Yellow games (or any RPG, for that matter), this is a step in the right direction. Be sure to check out our complete list of every game available on Nintendo Switch Online to keep up with each addition.</span>

                              <span>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.
The teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it&#x27;ll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it&#x27;s still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer&#x27;s last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. 


In the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.</span>

                              <span>Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.
The video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. 


The last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

                              <span>Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a &quot;Devolver Delayed Showcase&quot; to tell players all about the games they won&#x27;t be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.
&quot;We have some exciting news about next year,&quot; one host says. &quot;This year&#x27;s delays,&quot; the other host follows up. &quot;Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!&quot;
The Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. 
You can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.


Devolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today&#x27;s delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it&#x27;s better to delay a game than to launch it before it&#x27;s ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.</span>

                              <span>Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, and it hasn’t migrated from those platforms since it arrived in 2010. After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.
Rockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it&#x27;s unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. 


Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.</span>

                              <span>Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend&#x27;s Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn&#x27;t stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.
Described as &quot;a manaical poison aficionado,&quot; A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.


While we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method.

Beginning tomorrow, August 8, TMNT-themed costumes, cosmetic items, and emotes will let players transform their Street Fighter 6 avatars into Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The event also includes TMNT stamps and titles, plus wallpapers for camera mode. Even the Battle Hub is getting in on the spirit by decking it out with Turtles banners, signs, and trailers. In the trailer below, it looks as silly as you would expect. 


Street FFighter6 had a big showing at EVO this past weekend, as a new fighter A.K.I. was also announced. For more on Street Fighter 6, check out our review.</span>

                              <span>Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.
The lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  
Fans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. 


       

Mortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Be sure to check out the previous roster reveal trailers for Geras, Smoke, and Rain.</span>

                              <span>Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. 
Set in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there&#x27;s no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today&#x27;s Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won&#x27;t go down without a fight. 
Check out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they&#x27;ll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a &quot;Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.&quot; Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. 
Binding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party&#x27;s power into a devastating blow. 

&quot;The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.&quot; 
Deathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.</span>

                              <span>In 2017, Sonic Mania brought the series back to its 2D roots in a way not seen in decades. While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.
&quot;During Sonic Mania&#x27;s development, I didn&#x27;t expect this level of fan reaction or success,&quot; Iizuka says. &quot;That success created the opportunity to think a…</span>

                              <span>Somerville is bringing its mysterious alien invasion to PlayStation consoles on August 31. The game comes from Jumpship, a studio formed by former Playdead (Limbo, Inside) CEO Dino Patti.
It centers on a small family rocked by a sudden alien invasion of Earth, who must now survive by running and hiding. The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.


Somerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.
For more on Somerville, you can read Game Informer&#x27;s Somerville review and editor Kyle Hilliard&#x27;s opinion piece on why it&#x27;s the best alien invasion game since Half-Life 2.</span>

                              <span>Immortals of Aveum is an upcoming action game that mixes a fantasy world and its magic with first-person shooting. We&#x27;ve played a chunk of it and enjoyed it – read our full hands-on preview thoughts here – but now, we&#x27;ve heard a track from the game&#x27;s score. And you can too because we can exclusively reveal that track today. 
It&#x27;s big, robust, and heroic, fitting if the full game is anything like what we&#x27;ve gone hands-on with. After listening to this track, we interviewed the game&#x27;s audio director Aubrey Hodges, composer Jamie K, and media composer Tom Hawk about the game&#x27;s score, how the team created a soundtrack that blends hip-hop with orchestral arrangements, and so much more.

                              <span>The Pokémon Company has announced that a Pokémon Presents presentation is happening next week, on Tuesday, August 8.
It will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET and run for roughly 35 minutes. The company announced this with a short teaser clip on the official Pokémon Twitter account, and you can watch that for yourself below:

As you can see, the teaser doesn&#x27;t reveal too much beyond details of when the Pokémon Presents is happening. However, near its start, there&#x27;s an interesting use of purple-pink and neon lighting. Perhaps it&#x27;s alluding to Mewtwo or Mew, or maybe to Ryme City from Pokémon Detective Pikachu, which features plenty of neon lighting in the movie. It could be an allu…</span>

Additionally, Marcus clues the crew in on his time spent solving puzzles in Viewfinder and his preview impressions of Palia, an MMO-like life sim currently in closed beta.

                              <span>Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.
It’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. 
A spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: 
“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”
Striking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. 
The Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.

                              <span>Activision is teasing a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare-related reveal next week. 
This lighthearted tease, which you can see below, hints that the next Call of Duty is another Modern Warfare, even though 2022’s Call of Duty was Modern Warfare II. However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). 
Jokes on you, real key art here.

As you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” 
It seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. 
In the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that.

                              <span>Nintendo just had one of its best first quarters since the launch of the Switch in 2017, thanks in part to sales of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
The company’s latest financial report reveals that Tears of the Kingdom sold 18.51 million units from its release to June 30. This led to Nintendo having the highest “global sell-through of first-party” for a first quarter since the launch of the Switch. It says sales of Tears of the Kingdom also drove hardware sales, as Nintendo sold 3.91 million units in this quarter, which ran from April 1 to June 30, 2023. 


Nintendo says those 3.91 million units sold translates to unit sales for the entire Switch family of systems rising by 13.9% year-on-year, led primarily by the Switch OLED Model, which contributed 2.83 million of those sales…</span>

With Charizard serving as the figurehead Pokémon for this expansion, it&#x27;s sure to be a popular release given that particular Pocket Monster&#x27;s history with the TCG. 
This expansion continues building on the Scarlet and Violet games with even more Paldean species but also adds type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex. This mechanic recalls the Delta Species mechanic from the early 2000s, where the strongest form of a Pokémon could be of a different type than its evolutionary chain. However, type-shifted Tera Pokémon ex actually make sense within the context of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, as Tera Pokémon often change types when they Terastallize.

                              <span>Ne každý chce utratit stovky dolarů za softwarové upgrady počítačů. To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 překonává Microsoft ořezáním nákladů za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, a tím činí celý proces updatu značně dostuupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz a ušetřit mnohem více peněz. Zde tedy je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.
We have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:
Added ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.
Fixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.
Added multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.
We also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 &amp; Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).
For the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.
If you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.
Thank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!
