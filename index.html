A week ago, a GameStop listing suggested the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak amiibo could be arriving in the US at the end of August or early in September.
It now appears to have locked in the release date for next week, on August 26th. Pre-orders aren&#x27;t being taken just yet. When they are made available, Monster Hunter fans will be able to add Canyne Malzeno Palamute, Malzeno and Felyne Malzeno Palico to their amiibo collection.

Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of Splatoon 3 on September 9th, and if you&#x27;re eager to see more footage ahead of the third game&#x27;s release, you&#x27;re in luck.
The company has uploaded a new video on YouTube, and although it&#x27;s entirely in Japanese, it&#x27;s pretty easy to follow along if you&#x27;re already familiar with the way of the Inklings.

                              <span>The PvPvE survival battle arena game won&#x27;t be stuck on PlayStation
Like its predecessor, Deathverse: Let It Die will be playable on PC. The wacky multiplayer survival action game led with PS4 and PS5 as its only platforms, but GungHo Online and Supertrick Games confirmed a PC version in a live developer stream with Uncle Death.
A couple of weeks ago, Deathverse committed to a fall 2022 release window, after previously eying a spring launch. The delay came about in the wake of an open beta test.
&quot;We got a lot of data from the beta,&quot; explained game director Hideyuki Shin, &quot;and we&#x27;re planning to make as many adjustments as we can.&quot;
Some of the world-building vibes and close-up combat antics will feel familiar to Let It Die fans, but Deathverse has carved out a different path with 16-player Death Jamboree matches, in which participants try to stay alive long enough to duke it out in the Showdown Zone. All the while, powerful hunters can join the fray, and cryptids — including the chupacabra and jackalope — mingle with the hyperviolent contestants.

The goal is to be bold enough to earn GP (Good Points) and power up, but not be so bold that you bite off more than you can chew and get taken out. Classic battle royale strats.
Let It Die surprisingly ended up having the right stuff — it accumulated millions of players. Whether Deathverse: Let It Die can capture lightning in a bottle again, I&#x27;m not so sure, but anything&#x27;s possible. Having the game accessible on not just PS4/PS5, but also Steam, where free-to-play audiences have a chance to really snowball, feels crucial.
If nothing else, it warms my heart to know that Uncle Death&#x27;s still a jokester.

We haven&#x27;t heard a ton about Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed lately, but the new slime-shooting, trap-laying multiplayer game will be released on October 18, 2022.
Pre-orders are opening up at retailers like Amazon — how much is it? $40 for the standard edition on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, and $70 for the collector&#x27;s. The game will launch on the Epic Games Store for PC, and it will also be playable on PS4 and Xbox One.
In case you missed it, this is the latest asymmetric multiplayer title from IllFonic, the folks behind Friday the 13th: The Game and Predator: Hunting Grounds (which is back in the spotlight, if only for a bit, thanks to the new curiosity-grabbing movie Prey).

Last week, we got a massive info-dump on the next entry in Nintendo&#x27;s squid-shooter, Splatoon 3. It was a ton, ranging from a new hub and idol group to lockers, practice mode, and a catalog system. It was exciting, and because of that, I thought it might be time to return to its predecessor.
So I re-downloaded Splatoon 2, booted it up, and ventured out into the plaza. And within minutes I was reminded that yes, Splatoon is still quite good.

Of all the Marvel heroes, Iron Man has to be one of the most well-loved, thanks to Robert Downey Jr.&#x27;s portrayal of the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark. There have been a few Iron Man games over the years, including a 2008 release from SEGA in conjunction with the film (and a sequel in 2010), as well as a well-received VR game in 2020. Even with those titles, it still feels like Iron Man needs a big, bombastic game a la Insomniac&#x27;s Spider-Man.

                              <span>A new interview sheds light on Just Cause developer Avalanche Studio&#x27;s canceled open-world Iron Man game, rumored to be in the works a decade ago before getting axed in 2012. 
MinnMax&#x27;s Ben Hanson interviewed Christofer Sundberg, co-founder of Avalance, who has since left the studio to start a new company, Liquid Sword. During the interview, Hansen asked Sundberg about the fate of the Iron Man project, which Sundberg revealed as being in development for a year and a half to two years before being canceled due to what he describes as &quot;company politics.&quot;


Sundberg reveals that Disney wanted Avalanche to rapidly expand its staff to finish the game under a shortened development timeline. However, he refused, explaining that doing so would have put a massive strain on the studio.

                              <span>Join host Wesley LeBlanc as he takes you through a demo of Betrayal At Club Low, an upcoming indie with a unique aesthetic and an even more unique gameplay loop. Wesley&#x27;s enjoyed what he&#x27;s played of the game so far, and he&#x27;ll tell you why in today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today.
Betrayal At Club Low is exclusive to PC and will launch on September 9 on Steam and Itch.io. Cosmo D Studios is the developer who is actually just one game designer: Cosmo D. He&#x27;s the designer behind games like Off-Peak, The Norwood Suite, and Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1. In today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today, Wesley shows off roughly 20 minutes of Betrayal At Club Low, explaining how its unique dice-rolling mechanic works while highlighting what&#x27;s so interesting about this strange world and its accompanying aesthetic.

                              <span>Another one bites the dust. If you haven&#x27;t noticed, a number of high-profile delays have occurred in recent weeks, with many upcoming games pushed into next year. Unfortunately, the promising sci-fi platformer Planet of Lana joins that growing hit list.
Planet of Lana was first announced at E3 2021 with a 2022 launch window. The game stars Lana, a young girl, and her adorable cat-like companion Mui on a combat-free mission to preserve a serene planet occupied by robots and other creatures from corruption. Developer Wishfully Studios wants this cinematic puzzle platformer to make a big splash, announcing it’s pushing the release to spring 2023 to do so. 
Planet of Lana will be playable at Gamescom next week, so attendees have the opportunity to see how the game is shaping up first-hand. The title is slated to launch on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.
If you&#x27;re losing track of every big game to slip into 2023, this handy list should serve as a nice reminder.</span>

In Inkbound, the team has held onto the roguelike formula, but almost everything else is going in a new direction.
Players each control a character making their way through a magical world called Atheneum, a place from which countless stories emerge and come to life. Players enter realms defined by books and help to shape and define the worlds and narratives within.

                              <span>Gamescom kicks off next week with Opening Night Live, the annual showcase of trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley. The presentation is generally on par with E3 or Summer Game Fest when it comes to delivering significant news, and we now know a few of the major titles that will appear.
The Summer Game Fest Twitter account revealed that ONL will feature world premieres for Sonic Frontiers, Hogwarts Legacy, The Callisto Protocol, and Return to Monkey Island. That usually means we’ll get new trailers for each game, whether they be gameplay, story, or both. Of course, other titles will be shown as well including Dying Light 2’s Bloody Ties DLC and Telltale Games&#x27; The Expanse. 
Next Tuesday, @geoffkeighley hosts @gamescom Opening Night Live from Germany.

Hogwarts Legacy was recently delayed to February, and this will be our first look at it since its gameplay reveal in March. Sonic Frontiers and The Callisto Protocol both graced Game Informer’s cover the last couple of months, and this may be one of the last big marketing pushes before they arrive later this year. Return to Monkey Island, also slated to launch this year, may get a firm release date as well.  
Gamescom Opening Night Live will be streamed on August 23. The two-hour event begins at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.</span>

However, that content so far has been related to cosmetics, in-game parkour races, or other gameplay mechanics. Techland has yet to release anything new that pushes the story of Dying Light 2 forward. 
That could change soon as Dying Light 2&#x27;s first story DLC, Bloody Ties, will get the full worldwide premiere treatment at Gamescom&#x27;s Opening Night Live, which is hosted by Geoff Keighley and airs August 23. To tide fans over until then, the studio has released a teaser trailer that you can watch below: 


&quot;What dangers await?&quot; a press release reads. &quot;How can you beat them? What will you get in return? One thing is certain...it will be brutal.&quot; 
As you can see, the DLC seems to hint at a brutal faction within the City, perhaps one interested in gladiator-style arena combat. Only time will tell what Bloody Ties entails, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now.

                              <span>Death Stranding is one of 2019’s best games (in my personal opinion), and it’s one I hope everyone gets the chance to try. Sure, you might not like it, but if it hits, it hits hard. 
PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players know that, as the game was PlayStation exclusive at launch. It hit PC in 2020, but you had to buy it outright like any other PC game. Now, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members might get the chance to try this Norman Reedus-led adventure across America with their subscription if a new, somewhat cryptic tweet from the official PC Game Pass account is anything to go by.

sometimes we just like a good landscape picture #NewProfilePic
August 16, 2022
As you can see, PC Game Pass draws attention to the fact that it’s changed its profile pic to that of a familiar landscape. If you look at the profile pic, you’ll see what appears to be a landscape shot from Death Stranding. Now, it could be a different game but like, come on, that’s Death Stranding, right? 
All of this is to say that it seems like a formerly PlayStation-exclusive game – mind you, one developed by independent studio Kojima Productions that was funded by Sony Interactive Entertainment – is coming to PC Game Pass, a subscription service that’s a part of the Xbox ecosystem.

                              <span>Kilter Films, Bethesda Game Studios, and Amazon Studios announced in 2020 that a Fallout television series was on the way.
Not much has been revealed about it since then, other than a report from 2021 that detailed the show as a “gonzo, crazy, funny adventure.” However, images from the production’s set have begun to leak online, as reported by Eurogamer, and the show looks true and accurate to the famed video game series.

The level of detail on this Amazon Fallout series 🔥 pic.twitter.com/fou1UL1vhs
August 17, 2022
As you can see, the vault looks pretty spot-on, as do other details like the Vault-Tec logo. Even the vault suits look amazing, although, as the person who snapped that image mentioned, they are a little different from what we’re used to in the games. Nonetheless, my excitement for this series has grown considerably since seeing these images. Hopefully, this same attention to detail has been put into the writing. 
There is no release date for this series.

                              <span>Evil West, the upcoming third-person wild west action game developed by Flying Wild Hog, has been delayed. 
Originally due out this September, the game has now been delayed to November 22, 2022. Fortunately for those excited about the rootin’ tootin’ action of slaying vampires and killing other various (terrifying) creatures, this delay only pushes the game back by about two months. As for why, publisher Focus Entertainment released a statement on Twitter explaining that it’s the result of the team wanting the game to be the best it can be at launch. 
Here’s the studio’s statement, in full:

Evil West first premiered at The Game Awards 2020, and it immediately caught my attention. It gave me big Darkwatch vibes, a game I loved on PlayStation 2, and the first gameplay we saw at The Game Awards 2021 last December confirmed those vibes. If you’re looking for more of the game, you’re in luck because, in June, the studio released more than 10 minutes of new gameplay. 
Are you excited about Evil West? Let me know in the comments below! Also, if you played Darkwatch, that game was dope, right?</span>

As soon as I heard that the escape-room puzzle adventure game Escape Academy had split-screen co-op, I was in. And even as someone who&#x27;s not exactly &quot;into&quot; real-world escape rooms, it ended up being a fun, not-too-frustrating time with memorable scenarios like a room with rising water, or a scramble to find an antidote after being poisoned.

If you&#x27;re just here for the field-of-view slider, you can now crank the FOV from 60 all the way up to 120. That also goes for the console versions of Escape Academy — I tested it out on my PlayStation 5 copy this morning. I&#x27;ll probably settle somewhere in the middle. You…</span>

Sometimes I&#x27;m so immersed in my little narrative bubble in the games industry, I forget that there are some people who have never played a story-centric game in their lives! Considering the industry is more flooded with titles to choose from than ever before, it can be difficult to branch outside of the comfort zones of our favorite genres because there&#x27;s so much to play. No judgment — it honestly just gets me more enthused that I could have the opportunity to introduce someone to some of my favorite games of all time. That&#x27;s exactly what happened this weekend when I got to chatting to a friend who works in esports (something I know equally little about as she does narrative games).

                              <span>The never-ending story
Shiny Shoe, the studio behind deckbuilding locomotive defense game Monster Train, has already made its mark with one roguelite. Now it looks to make another in Inkbound, an isometric turn-based battler with some pretty interesting ideas.
We had a chance to get a hands-off look at the current state of Inkbound. It&#x27;s going to look pretty Diablo at first. The camera takes an isometric angle on the action, following our two presenters creative director Andrew Krausnick and community manager Cami Baumann-Jaeger as they venture into the world of stories.
Right away, there are notable differences from Monster Train. While there is the allure of better runs and rewards on the horizon, there&#x27;s also a quest system, where NPCs can give players tasks to complete. They&#x27;re built i…</span>

Gamescom Opening Night Live is less than a week away, which means we&#x27;re steadily seeing which games are pre-announcing their show appearance. Today, showrunner Geoff Keighley and Telltale Games confirm that the latter&#x27;s The Expanse series will show off a first look at gameplay during the showcase.
The Opening Night Live stream is airing on Twitch and YouTube, on August 23 at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT. The show&#x27;s expected to run for two hours, with over 30 games on stage to show.

The new Telltale series is from the reformed Telltale Games, which was bought and revived after the first Telltale Games had to shut its doors. This new Telltale, under LCG Entertainment, is the one working on The Expanse: A Telltale…</span>

KeokeN Interactive has shared the news that its epic sci-fi adventure Deliver Us Mars will no longer meet its previously expected September 2022 release date. Speaking on Twitter, the Dutch studio rescheduled the launch of its passion project to February 2, 2023, when it will finally arrive on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
&quot;It is important to us that this experience is the best it can be at launch. With this in mind, we’ve collectively made the difficult decision to move the release date to February 2, 2023 in order to ensure that we are able to live up to that ambition,&quot; wrote KeokeN in yesterday&#x27;s statement.
&quot;Whilst we understand this news might be disappointing, we are excited for you all to face the challenges of Mars, traverse its hostile environments, and discover the mystery of the ARKS. Your patience will allow us to deliver the best experience we can.&quot;
Those looking forward to the ethereal jaunt to The Red Planet can at least take heart in the additional news that a brand new trailer is set to premiere during the Future Games Show, which is scheduled for August 24 as part of next week&#x27;s Gamescom festivities. While the last-minute delay is unfortunate, the acclaim afforded 2018 predecessor Deliver Us The Moon suggests that KeokeN will have something special to offer interstellar explorers come launch day.
Deliver Us Mars launches February 2 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store).

thatgamecompany&#x27;s dramatic and evocative adventure Sky: Children of the Light is now getting set to enchant a whole new community of players, following the news that a PlayStation port is currently in the works.
Originally released on mobile platforms back in 2019, with a Nintendo Switch port following in 2021, Sky: Children of the Light is a fantasy open-world adventure with a heavy emphasis on social connection and cooperative interaction. Players explore a large, abstract kingdom made up of multiple realms. Through engagement with other players and various spirits, the player evolves their flight ability, slowly allowing them to progress further and further beyond the borders of the hub world, &quot;Home.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;aBQRCHusYyU
Much like thatgamecompany&#x27;s award-winning titles Journey and Flower, Sky: Children of the Light eschews combat and heavy antagonism in favor of exploration, mystery, and puzzle-solving. A slant on cosmetic items allows players to trade the in-game currency, candles, for various customization items including emotes, accessories, and musical instruments. Sky is currently engaged in its 14th season, with thatgamecompany continuing to build upon the universe it has created with additional lore, characters, and activities.
In a brief statement, the developer expressed its excitement and desire to &quot;extend the circle of light even further&quot; with the new PlayStation port. Though no further details nor a release window were announced, it was noted that the port will feature full crossplay functionality with the Switch and mobile editions. Fans should keep a watchful eye on the official Sky social media channels for more info.

Genda GiGO Entertainment is preparing to roll down the shutters on another Tokyo arcade center. On September 25, at the close of business, the GiGO Akihabara Arcade Building 4, will wish its final players a fond farewell.
As is the case with many of Japan&#x27;s dwindling arcade centers, the GiGO center has reached the end of its current lease with the building owners, with GiGO choosing to close down the arcade rather than renew its contract. Any of Center 4&#x27;s remaining roles, such as its hosting of the Ichiban Kuji lottery, will instead be relocated to Arcade Center 5, which is located in the northern Akihabara district. (Thanks to PR Times for the statement and Siliconera for the translation.)
https://twitter.com/GiGO_Akihabara4/status/1557972695379476481?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;pZWSJhZT5gm6-ZK6PuxyEw
The GiGO arcade centers — all of which bore the Sega name until the start of 2022 — have stood as some of the longest-running and most iconic arcade centers in Tokyo. Back in 2020, Sega closed what was considered the most popular of its arcades, Sega Building 2, after a 17-year occupation. This was followed by the closure (and ultimately, relocation) of Sega&#x27;s 28-year-old Ikebukuro arcade center.
Since then, the continuing consolidation and/or closure of Sega/GiGO&#x27;s arcade centers seems an unfortunate inevitability. As of September 26, Akihabara will play host to three remaining GiGO centers.

Futurama: Hit &amp; Run never existed officially (that was Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run), but this fan made video is just a good job of convincing me it did!
From the mind of Slurm Team, this project is actually a total conversion mod with &quot;all fully from scratch 3D models,&quot; with the intention of crafting it like it was an expansion for the original Hit &amp; Run. Right now it&#x27;s slated to be released in demo form at the end of August or the beginning of September, but the crew is looking for folks to contribute in multiple arenas, including texture art and mission scripters. You can see how it&#x27;s progressing below.
The Hit &amp; Run universe is making a comeback thanks to fans
Not only is this project on the horizon, but someone is also taking it upon themselves to remaster Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run, with custom cutscene animations, no less! For years, various folks who have been involved with the original Simpsons game have talked in whispers about bringing the series back to some degree, but often speak of the pile of rights issues they&#x27;d have to wade through.
Perhaps the popularity of these fan creations could grease the wheels a bit.

I wasn’t sure what to expect with We Are OFK. Based on the trailer, I thought it was going to be the usual fare we get with episodic, choice-based narratives (which I love). When I started playing, I was surprised to find that We Are OFK is less of a game and more of an animated miniseries with interactive elements, including music videos. It made a lot more sense that it was recommended to me to play on “whatever [my] preferred TV watching setup is.” We Are OFK is also considered a biopic by its creators, and while I&#x27;d more categorize it as a memoir, the point is that the project is a fictional telling of the forming of a real virtual band, which sounds more confusing than it is.

The Switch practically begs for custom storage solutions given how unique the hardware is (and its software carts!), and there&#x27;s plenty available. But these mini Nintendo Switch game cases, found by Rakueru on Twitter, are something else.
If you recall, some folks came up with homebrew creations roughly four years ago, but weren&#x27;t selling them directly. So these are actually from the Etsy seller Kustom3DGermany, but they&#x27;re currently sold out, so make sure you favorite the store if you want them.
Here&#x27;s the full list of games that you can get mini Switch game cases for:
Animal Crossing
Crash Bandicoot
Diablo
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze
Doom
Final Fantasy VII
Final Fantasy X|X-2
Final Fantasy IX
Lego City Undercover
Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

Note that for some people, the &quot;similar items on Etsy&quot; listings below the aforementioned link have very strange recommendations that might be NSFW. You&#x27;ve been warned!
They also make mini 3DS cases if you&#x27;re interested, as well as Switch mini case holders.

Koei Tecmo has proudly announced that its hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash epic Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has passed one million sales and shipments since its launch on Nintendo Switch back in June.
A joint production of Koei Tecmo, Nintendo, and developer Omega Force, Three Hopes sees new hero Shez brought under the wing of the Garreg Mach Monastery. Choosing tutelage under the banner of one of Fire Emblem&#x27;s &quot;Three Houses&quot; — The Black Eagles, The Golden Deer, or The Blue Lions — Shez and their newfound allies against the might of the Empire. Three Hopes, as the name denotes, offers three distinct but interconnected tales depending on the player&#x27;s school of choice.

Once out on the battlefield, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes features the typical hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash action that one would associate with Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Warriors titles. Considered a major improvement on 2017&#x27;s Fire Emblem Warriors, Three Hopes has won acclaim from both critics and the Fire Emblem fan community for its wide roster of playable characters and engaging combat, though it has also been criticized for its repetition and lack of technical growth over its Warriors brethren. For the most part, however, Three Hopes is considered a success, and an absolute must-play for Fire Emblem fans.
Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is available now on Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>That horizontal Switch dock setup has everyone asking questions
Masahiro Sakurai isn&#x27;t doing Smash Ultimate DLC streams at the moment or working on another entry (that we know of), but he&#x27;s still taking to Twitter constantly to talk about the hobby. His latest set of tweets involves his updated Sakurai gaming setup, which has decidedly gone vertical.
In a series of photos, he shows off his made-to-order shelves, which house numerous gaming consoles. Visibly, we can see an Xbox Series X, PS5, Switch, PS4, PS3, Wii U (!), Famicom (NES), Genesis, and SNES. The top plate and back are removed to push out heat, and he leaves the door open when playing. Adorably, he has a few controllers labeled with tiny little stickers, like &quot;Xbox X&quot; or &quot;2&quot; (presumably for player two). Those same labels adorn the power cables that plug into the wall (and the power supplies can be turned off individually).
An updated look at the Masahiro Sakurai gaming setup:
https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1559806360329392128
The most curious element is easily the horizontally-docked Switch. He even had to post a response tweet because of it! Here&#x27;s what he said: &quot;There was a reaction to the Switch dock horizontal placement...it&#x27;s not recommended by the manufacturer, so do it at your own risk. This is just my personal experience, but I had no problems using it until I cleared Xenoblade Chronicles 3.&quot; Well, if Sakurai says it&#x27;s okay! To be frank I never even really considered it, but it looks awesome on certain shelves.
If you&#x27;re curious, PushDustIn chronicled Sakurai&#x27;s previous setup in 2019 here. You can compare and contrast!

Mere weeks from the Loyal Samoyed controversy, Activision Blizzard is at the center of another plagiarism controversy pertaining to its military shooter franchise, Call of Duty. And once again, the accusations are pointing toward a brand new, but familiar-looking, character skin.
As reported by Polygon, the new plagiarism allegations are aimed at Call of Duty: Vanguard DLC skin &quot;Doomsayer,&quot; a frighteningly imposing figure bedecked in black, full-body tactical armor, a grim reaper-style hood, and one of those wanky digital facemasks then were popular for a hot minute at comic-book conventions. The programmable faceplate sports a grimacing skull, a common design for the billion-dollar franchise.

One god game is leaving Xbox Game Pass at the end of August, but a few &quot;immortal&quot; games are stepping up to take its place. As Supergiant&#x27;s Hades leaves at the end of the month, Xbox Game Pass picks up Immortals Fenyx Rising, Immortality, and several other new games for the service.
The selection for this month is a solid selection of indie gems, both new and old. Coffee Talk arrives today, letting you play barista to a host of creatures in alt-Seattle. Opus: Echo of Starsong arrives later on, bringing a vibrant art style and deep narrative to the service.
A notable arrival this month on Game Pass is Immortality, the new FMV adventure from Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid. It was pretty impressive when I previewed it, and seems like it…</span>

                              <span>You only need one button
Ninja or Die is a peculiar name for a game, but I took a look at the ninja-slaying roguelite on Steam and I&#x27;m intrigued by... all of this. It&#x27;s so fast and flashy, I can hardly keep up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;94IVbgfT0p0
I&#x27;ve watched the trailer for Ninja or Die a few times now, and I&#x27;m still piecing it together; slow-mo helps, but I doubt it will fully click until we&#x27;ve tried playing it.
Nao Games and Marvelous Europe are hoping to blend &quot;hardcore action&quot; with &quot;simple controls,&quot; and I&#x27;m curious to see how that will pan out once the training wheels are off. Specifically, Ninja or Die uses one-button controls. &quot;Jump to where you point, eviscerate the enemy by dashing through them, and hold to attack with greater power.&quot;
The setup is that you&#x27;re a secret agent in a &quot;ninja-eat-ninja world&quot; with bosses to bring down and hordes of smaller creeps to cut through. As a roguelite experience, death is a part of the deal and you&#x27;ll accumulate perma-upgrades as well as alternate characters.

As opposed to some recent roguelites, Ninja or Die seems to emphasize high scores and replayability over a loop-based format that&#x27;s servicing a larger story. On that note, levels are &quot;a mix&quot; of procedural and hand-crafted, and there&#x27;s an Infinite Watchtower to run.
The pieces might not all add up in the end, but the strangeness appeals to me. I just hope that when I&#x27;m the one leaping around Japan like a madman, I have a better sense of my busy surroundings. From the outside looking in, readability is a concern.
As luck would have it, there&#x27;s a browser-based demo to get a feel for it.
Another one for the wait-and-see wishlist? I think so.

                              <span>Thunderbolt graphics card enclosures are one of the coolest bits of kit you can get, I think. Open up this metal box, put a graphics card inside, and suddenly any PC or laptop you connect to it via Thunderbolt gets a substantial upgrade in gaming prowess. These docks used to cost around £200 or £300, but recently we&#x27;ve started to see radically more affordable options - and today we&#x27;ve reached a new low-water mark. 
The Lenovo Legion BoostStation can handle GPUs up to 300W (think an Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti or AMD RX 6800 XT), and is available for just £93 when you use the code BANK15 to knock 15% off the price at Ebay.

Use code BANK15 to drop the price of a cheap and cheerful Adata SU630 SSD from £35 to £29.78, and marvel at the speed and responsiveness improvement you&#x27;ll see on machines that were previously running on mechanical hard drives. I performed an upgrade using a similar drive on my brother&#x27;s old laptop, and it breathed new life into a machine almost ten years old.

It&#x27;s called Videoverse, and is described as a narrative adventure above love and friendship, inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s now defunct social network, Miiverse (which all Wii U and 3DS owners know is the single, most wholesome thing to have ever existed in video games). Have a watch of the teaser trailer below.

From what I&#x27;ve seen, it looks like it has potential.

                              <span>Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.
We Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game&#x27;s initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member&#x27;s point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.

                              <span>New set images have leaked from the production of Amazon’s Fallout TV show, and they appear to show the inside of Vault 32. There’s also a nice bit of propaganda that reads “The outside world can never hurt you” and shows a superheroic Vault Boy deflecting nukes with a shield. How very Fallout. Read on to take a look at some of the images below.

That should pick you up.&quot; Man bursts into tears. Says, &quot;But doctor... I am Neon White. No, wait. What did you say? Did you say white or blight? Oh, white, oh, okay.&quot;

                              <span>Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn&#x27;t involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE&#x27;s story would come later, in the 2014 Director&#x27;s Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games&#x27; puzzler a bit more, well, shape.
Even with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director&#x27;s Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I&#x27;m telling you: please don&#x27;t write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.

It’s in development at Spitfire Interactive, a freshly founded studio made up of former Hand Of Fate devs. None of the characters in the trailer seem to be wearing their blankets around their shoulders, but it’s worth a watch all the same.

                              <span>Tower Of Fantasy is a free-to-play MMO gacha game, the sort of game that implores you to spend in-game currency on lootboxes in the hopes you&#x27;ll build a particularly powerful collection of anime people. Genshin Impact wrapped this business model up in a surprisingly excellent open world RPG, that Graham called one of the best games of 2020. Tower Of Fantasy pulls from a neighbouring gacha vending machine, except that its mixture of MMO, realtime combat, and lootboxing isn&#x27;t wrapped up in as consistent a package.

                              <span>Valve have launched the SteamVR 1.23 update, and to mark the occasion, they’re letting you… look at high-quality scanned models of genuinely deceased insects? That they found? I guess???


Key technical improvements to SteamVR include multiple crash fixes, smoother controller animations and new extension support for the OpenXR platform; the full patch notes are on Steam. But the update also adds a new SteamVR Home setting that – and I quote, with emphasis Valve’s - &quot;showcases CT scans of actual dead bugs we found lying on the ground outside our office.&quot; See? The Valve Index isn’t just for playing Half-Life Alyx, eh.

If you’re familiar with the Game Pass Twitter accounts, they like to do the flippant social media thing and tease followers. Well, this latest attempt has people speculating that the Sony-trademarked Death Stranding is about to hit PC Game Pass.

                              <span>Tony the Tiger – the neckerchiefed mascot of Kellogg’s Frosties – is becoming a VTuber, with some kind of heavily sponsored Twitch stream scheduled for this Friday in which “he” will play “a popular battle royale game” with some other livestreamers. I’m not very interested in this, to be honest, but I am curious about the “milk-coolant PC” that Tony’s avatar will be using to get the W’s and build creepy parasocial relationships with viewers. Could such a PC, liquid-cooled by a dairy product, actually function?

                              <span>Recently launched sci-fantasy gacha MMO Tower Of Fantasy is trying to tackle server queues and cheats, the developers have promised. In a message posted to the official site, Tower Of Fantasy’s devs Hotta Studio say they’ve now implemented increased server caps and improved server recommendation logic for PC. There’s also a queue timer, if you find your feet tapping while you’re waiting to join. You can watch the game’s launch trailer below if you missed it last week.

It&#x27;s a Kirbapalooza this week, as the gorgeous Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet — which is sort of Mario Party, sort of Fall Guys, sort of Monkey Ball, and very Kirby — sees its global release on Nintendo Switch, kicking off another ripple of Kirby celebrations for the pink puffball&#x27;s 30th anniversary.
Alongside the Kirby Café in Japan launching a new Dream Buffet dessert, Kirby and the Forgotten Land will also be offering a new Present Code from today until the 17th September.

2022 is shaping up to be a pretty darn good year for Kirby. First there was the release of Kirby and the Forgotten Land back in March - which we described as &#x27;an absolute delight&#x27; in our review - then there were the recent 30th anniversary celebrations, and now the release of the chompy couch co-op game, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet.
In celebration of this latest game release, the Kirby Café in Japan has taken to Twitter to announce that both their Tokyo and Hakata branches will start selling a Dream Buffet-inspired dessert from September 1st.

The pop-up Pokémon Center was always going to be one of the biggest attractions at this week&#x27;s Pokémon World Championships, yet despite a seemingly organised pre-booking system, it seems that the store has already succumbed to huge queues.
London last hosted a Pokémon Center in 2019, producing a similar result of queues around the block; however, the attention gained by the World Championships had us suspecting that a firmer level of organisation would be in place this time around.

The June release of Dotemu and Tribute Games&#x27; excellent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge fired up our passion for the heroes in a half-shell in a way we haven&#x27;t felt for a long time. With the upcoming release of Konami&#x27;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection — and with news that port wizards Digital Eclipse are at the helm of this compilation of classics — we&#x27;re getting ready to drown in another wave of excitement and nostalgia come 30th August.
With so many Turtles games having come to Nintendo consoles over the years (which Stuart Gipp dutifully chronicled for us), it&#x27;s tough to know exactly where to begin, especially if — shocker! — you weren&#x27;t even born when the first TMNT titles many of us glued to our TV sets and arguing passionately over the relative merits of one Ninja Turtle (or Hero Turtle in the UK) over the other.

Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out now for the Switch eShop and is, by all accounts, a pretty good time! We posted our review of the game earlier and gave it a pretty healthy score of 8/10, stating that it&#x27;s &quot;an easy, breezy game to jump into, perfect for beginners and young gamers, with plenty of courses, lots of unlockable goodies, and a budget price point to boot&quot;.
We&#x27;ve got good news for long time fans of the Kirby franchise, too. If you&#x27;re an owner of previous Kirby titles on the Switch, then you&#x27;ll be entitled to some bonus race music in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet. All for free, no less! This includes Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Kirby Fighters 2, Super Kirby Clash, and Kirby Star Allies, with three bonus tracks awarded for each game.

                              <span>Comparing the courses to the base game and Tour.
We&#x27;re all pretty happy to have more Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to play, right? Over the past few months, we&#x27;ve got two brand new waves of courses thanks to the Booster Course Pass, which kicked off with Wave 1 in March and just recently followed up with Wave 2 earlier this month. But if there&#x27;s been one common complaint among fans, it&#x27;s to do with how the courses look compared to the base game.
Digital Foundry has now shared its thoughts on the 16 new tracks that we currently have access to, comparing them to both the main game&#x27;s 48 courses and their Mario Kart Tour originals. So far, all of the Booster Course Pass additions have either been available in Mario Kart Tour or added at a later date (Sky-High Sundae), and this is what Digital Foundry thinks is &quot;the heart of the issue&quot;.

At the end of every classic Kaiju film, the titular plods back into the sea, safe in the knowledge that their foe is vanquished. They return to their underwater homes, pour themselves a coffee and watch their day&#x27;s highlights on TV. It&#x27;s not a bad day&#x27;s work; but they are alone, stuck in a cycle of people asking &quot;where is the monster?&quot; and never &quot;how is the monster?&quot; Without local bars, mutual friends, community events or even Tinder, the kaiju dating scene is a tough world. If only there was some way that we mortal humans could help...
We imagine that a thought process similar to this went through the minds of Squiddershins when it was deciding on the topic for its latest game. The product of that process is Kaichu: The Kaiju Dating Sim, a game which encourages those tired of the dating race in the real world to imagine how tough it would be if they were 300 feet tall.

2D meets 3D meets cyberpunk in ANNO: Mutationem, an action-adventure game with RPG elements, 2D platforming elements, and detectivey bits that&#x27;s making its way to the Nintendo Switch very soon, alongside a free demo and a pre-order discount. The game was previously released on PC, PS4, and PS5 in March, 2022.
In ANNO: Mutationem, players are cast as Ann Flores, a highly-skilled combat extraordinaire who&#x27;s on a personal mission to kick ass and take names in order to find her brother. She&#x27;s accompanied by equally-talented hacker side-kick Ayane, who will help her to hone her skills, unravel conspiracies, and interrogate cyborg corgis (among other witnesses and suspects, of course).

We&#x27;re all sad about the death of Miiverse, and even Splatoon 3&#x27;s attempt to sort-of bring it back won&#x27;t soothe the pain of not being able to sample the delights of one-bit art from across the world. But One Night Stand developer Kinmoku announced today that their next game, Videoverse, is directly inspired by Miiverse — and now we just hope that, unlike actual Miiverse, it will come to the Switch.
Videoverse is set in the days of the early internet, and anyone who remembers old-timey technology like Teletext, MSN Messenger, and the chaotic &#x27;90s internet that was pastiched in Hypnospace Outlaw will find themselves catapulted into Nostalgia Town by the game&#x27;s design:

What do you get when you take a generous helping of Fall Guys, add a pinch of Super Monkey Ball and then mix in a lovely big dollop of Kirby? Well, a great big dream buffet, that&#x27;s what.
Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is a bright and breezy party game that sees a whole field full of Kirby characters roll at speed down sweet treat-laden tracks where the only objective is to get to the bottom first and lay claim to the largest mountain of strawberries when you get there.

Kirby has one of the most simple and recognisable designs out of any video game character. He&#x27;s just a pink round boy with big eyes and an irresistible face! We want to cuddle and squeeze him. But for today&#x27;s brand new Kirby game, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, it seems like Kirby needed to be even rounder!
@ObscureKirby has looked into Kirby&#x27;s character model in the party game, which sees Kirby roll around in various food-themed minigames and challenges, and has found out that Kirby&#x27;s model is more round than it was in his previous game, Kirby and the Forgotten Land. (Thanks, NintendoSoup!)

Publisher Secret Mode has announced that its side-scrolling adventure title Little Orpheus will launch on the Switch next month on September 13th.
The launch comes after the game was delayed indefinitely back in March of this year due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. At the time, the publisher stated that &quot;some of the themes and content may be upsetting to players&quot; due to potentially offensive references to the Soviet Union. However, after scouring through the game in the months since, it has determined that the game — developed by The Chinese Room of Dear Esther and Everybody&#x27;s Gone To The Rapture fame — can launch without any changes to its content.

Devolver Digital has always had an eye for some delightfully odd gaming experiences. Play as an ape escaping its captors while freeform jazz blasts in the background. Rob pretentious rich people as a con man in 18th century France. Eviscerate houses full of goons as a drug-addicted ninja with PTSD. The latest in this long line of the publisher&#x27;s memorable releases, Cult of the Lamb, places you in the role of an adorable fluffy lamb harboring the soul of a sinister ageless deity. It’s intense, it’s cute, it’s stressful, and it’s absolutely something that you need to try out.
You begin your journey by being sacrificed by a woodland cult which is killing the poor creature because a prophecy stated that a lamb would be the vessel by which The One Who Waits would make its glorious return. The four resident Old Ones really weren’t fans of The One Who Waits, so they imprisoned it in another dimension to consolidate their power over the woodland creatures.

The Pokémon World Championships kick off tomorrow in London and the city has truly thrown itself into the celebrations. If you are lucky enough to be attending the Championships or are attending the Pokémon Center Pop-Up over the next few days and are looking for a way to arrive in true Trainer style, then look no further than the TFL cable cars which have undergone a Pokémon makeover.
Many are heading to the event today, either to prep for the Championships, settle themselves in London for the night, or to spend lots of money at the Pop-Up store, and they&#x27;ve been taking pictures of the Pokémon-themed sights. Each car has been branded with a different Pokémon type and features unique creature displays depending on which one you get to ride in. Even TfL has got into the spirit and is celebrating the makeover on Twitter!

The Pokémon World Championships are almost upon us and The Pokémon Company has revealed a healthy amount of in-game merchandise that viewers will be able to get their hands on for free.
These limited-time offers (brought to our attention by Go Nintendo) will be available to anyone watching the championships via the official Twitch streams, during which various codes will be posted that will allow you to unlock several cool new items in Pokémon Unite, Pokémon GO and the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It looks like these codes are not going to hang around for long after the Championships end on August 22nd, so be sure to have your Switch and mobile at the ready while tuning in!

It&#x27;s been announced that Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes has now surpassed 1 million units shipped worldwide, marking a significant milestone for the latest entry from developers Omega Force and Team Ninja.
The achievement encompasses sales across physical and digital formats, though it&#x27;s currently not known what the sales split is across the various territories. What&#x27;s noteworthy, however, is the milestone has seemingly been reached much quicker than the game&#x27;s predessecor, Fire Emblem Warriors, which reached 1 million units shipped roughly 7 months after its launch in September 2017. Three Hopes, on the other hand, launched a little less than 2 months ago in June 2022 (with no 3DS version, either!).

Inti Creates, the developer behind Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 — the long-awaited third mainline game in the series — has acknowledged that there&#x27;s a save data-corrupting bug in the Switch version of the game.
Sharing the information on Twitter, the bug can occur when you delete a save file and then change the settings or language options on the title screen. This will then cause the last played save file to get corrupted. The issue only appears to have happened since the game was updated to ver. 1.0.2.

Výsledky jsou poměrně zajímavé, v průměru lze říci, že Ryzeny (konkrétně Ryzen 9 5900HX a Ryzen 7 Pro 6850U) jsou stále nejlepší, Intel je v závěsu (model Core i7 1280P), ale Apple M2 už k dotažení moc nechybí (M1 pak není o moc horší). Bavíme se přitom o linuxových testech, kde podpora čipů rodin M1 a M2 je teprve vyvíjena, přičemž Apple spíše linuxové podpoře naházel klacky pod nohy, kterými se vývojáři z Asahi Linuxu už více než rok a půl postupně prokousávají.</span>

Thus far the result is a slew of reskin mods which let you replace Spidey with other characters and play while looking like Kingpin, Miles Morales, Mary Jane, or - as pictured above - Stan Lee.

                              <span>Earlier today we looked at a deal on AMD&#x27;s top graphics card, the RX 6950 XT, and now it&#x27;s time to look at the opposite end of the market: one of Nvidia&#x27;s cheapest RTX graphics cards. Ebay is running a promotion today that knocks 15% off the price of brand-new items when you use the code BANK15 at the checkout, and you can use this to pick an RTX 3060 12GB for just £279. 
This is a great price for this mid-range GPU, and it&#x27;s especially rare to see features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and DLSS image reconstruction at this price point.

                              <span>Excellent roguelikelike dungeon crawler Backpack Hero launched into early access this week, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth a go if you enjoy shuffle items around your inventory grid. Backpack Hero is all about arranging weapons and items inside your massive sack to develop powerful synergies, see. Some items buff items touching them, while others benefit from empty spaces, or some insist upon being in a certain grid row, and some even move around by themselves. The buildcrafting gets fiendishly fun as your critter delves deeper into dungeons in search of a giant hunk of cheese.

Unity’s board of directors unanimously cast aside the AppLovin offer, which hadn’t been sought by the game engine company, after a “thorough financial and strategic evaluation”. The board has recommended that shareholders vote against AppLovin’s offer.

                              <span>Guild Wars 2 celebrates its 10th anniversary this month, and ArenaNet is celebrating by introducing the MMORPG to a new audience on Steam. 
On Tuesday, August 23, Guild Wars 2 will be available on a third-party platform for the first time ever. Since its launch in August 2012, the game has only been accessible through ArenaNet’s proprietary launcher. Guild Wars 2 on Steam will retain its subscription-less, free-to-play model. Additionally, Steam players and those on the original client will play together on the same servers. If you’re a newcomer wanting to catch up on a decade’s worth of content, a $99.97 Complete Edition of the game for Steam bundles Guild Wars 2’s three expansions and all five seasons.
ArenaNet is introducing Twitch Drops. Now you can earn exclusive in-game character outfits, experience boosters, and a special Glowing Purple Mask cosmetic by watching streamers play the game from August 23-28. 


“Guild Wars 2 has delighted over 16 million players for a decade with its subscription-free business model, epic collaborative open-world boss encounters, and revolutionary mount system,” said Kendall Boyd, Senior Vice President of Marketing at NCSOFT West. “By launching on Steam, a whole new audience of players who have never had the chance to adventure with us will be able to experience one of the greatest fantasy worlds in gaming. Everyone at NCSOFT and ArenaNet is excited to welcome them into our amazing community.”
Guild Wars 2 has been hailed as one of the best MMOs of its time. ArenaNet has supported the title with seasonal updates and expansion packs, the latest being February’s End of Dragons.

                              <span>The Knights of the Old Republic remake sounds like it may be running into some trouble, but fans of the original classic BioWare game have reason to celebrate. Celebrated collectibles maker Gentle Giant is prepping a new statue depicting one of the central characters of the original game. Jedi Knight Bastila Shan has never looked better.
The action-posed figure depicts Bastila Shan in battle with a Guardian Droid in the ruins of Dantooine, one of the early sites players visited in the game. The statue is made of PVC, and looks to feature some impressive sculpting and paint work. The yellow-hued double-bladed lightsaber in mid-swing is a particular highlight.

If it’s been a few years since you ventured into the classic Star Wars RPG, Bastila Shan was a Jedi Master many thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga. Among other gifts provided by the Force, she had the rare capability known as battle meditation, which could be used to boost her allies and demoralize her enemies. At one point, she was tortured and turned to the dark side by Darth Malak, and the player is given a choice of how to interact with her – including options to redeem or kill her.
The new statue is steering toward launch in spring of 2023, but pre-orders open in just a few days, on 8/19 over at Gentle Giant’s official site. Suggested retail price is 80 republic credits, or $80 if you prefer your local currency.</span>

                              <span>Blizzard announced that cross-progression is coming to Overwatch 2, and starting today, you can merge multiple accounts onto a single profile. 
With Overwatch 2 set to release on Oct. 4, which is also when the game will replace the original Overwatch, now’s a great time to get all your cosmetics, loot boxes, and more in order. It’s also a great time to merge some accounts so that you can, for example, jump between playing on PC and PlayStation freely. Fortunately, Blizzard made that possible today because you now merge multiple accounts. 
“With the launch of cross-progression, players can merge multiple Overwatch accounts to carry progression and in-game cosmetics into Overwatch 2 on a single profile,” a press release reads. “Starting Aug. 16, every player with a linked console account will be prompted at login to identify, select, and confirm the accounts you want to merge. Once you approve, we will prepare you accounts to be merged during the release of Overwatch 2.
“All players will need a battle.net account to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Progress from linked console accounts will be stored on your battle.net accounts, which will share in-game cosmetics and progress across the linked accounts.”

                              <span>Last week, a Fortnite tweet announced an incoming Dragon Ball crossover event, with the mythical wish-fulfilling dragon, Shenron, adorning the shared screenshot. At the time, details about content and features were still a mystery. However, a short gameplay trailer released today revealed several collectible items and a Dragon Ball-themed map. You can watch the zany footage below.


According to Gamespot, two bundles touting skins inspired by popular characters will be available for purchase. The cosmetics include Goku, Vegeta, and Bulma with alternate styles, Beerus, and back bling items like Seer Fish, Power Pole, Kamesennin’s Shill, and two new Pickaxes. Nimbus and Space Pod gliders also appear with an anime-themed Kamehameha attack to decimate foes the Saiyan way. Finally, creative maps contain cool locations like Kami’s Palace, Goku’s House, the Room of Spirit and Time, and more. 
The description of the event reads as follows:
The Fortnite Dragon Ball Crossover awaits die-hard fans today.

More specifically, OverBorder Studio&#x27;s take on the action formula popularized by From Software hits consoles and PC on Aug. 18. If you&#x27;re the type of person who loves a good Souls-like, or if you&#x27;ve been curious about Thymesia for a while now, you&#x27;re going to want to check out today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Not only does it feature more than 10 minutes of new gameplay, but Marcus, who&#x27;s reviewing the game for Game Informer, walks Wesley through what works in the game, what doesn&#x27;t, and how it&#x27;s different from the countless others like it in the genre.

                              <span>Yesterday, Half-Life fans came together as part of a community-created online event. The goal? To get as many people as possible playing the original 1998 Half-Life on Steam in an effort to set a new record for concurrent players. And not only did they accomplish that, but they also had a fun time remembering a game…

                              <span>Focus Entertainment announced the news this morning
A game set in the Wild West that also lets me fight vampires? Sounds like a blast to me, and it&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re getting from Flying Wild Hog&#x27;s newest title Evil West. The game was originally set to release next month on September 20, but per publisher Focus Entertainment&#x27;s official Twitter page, they just announced that Evil West will be delayed an extra two months to November 22, 2022, to achieve the level of polish they need for the game&#x27;s five-platform release.

Flying Wild Hog&#x27;s letter was understandable apologetic, thanking fans for the &quot;continued support and patience for Evil West.&quot;

                              <span>How to make sure all those fancy skins transfer over
Overwatch 2 is just a few months away. We&#x27;ve known that Overwatch 2 will have cross-progression for a while, and today Blizzard is explaining just how all of it will work.
Cross-progression means that all progression and in-game cosmetics in Overwatch 2 will span across different systems. While previously having, say, a fancy Tracer skin on PlayStation 4 didn&#x27;t mean you could access it on PC, the new system will merge and allow you to use the skin on both.
Starting today on August 16, players with a linked console account will be allowed to identify and confirm the accounts they want to merge. Once approved, the accounts will be prepared to merge on Overwatch 2&#x27;s release. You&#x27;ll need a Battle.net account no matter what, and all progress from the linked accounts will be stored on the Battle.net account.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6aB-H8QFXA0
As Blizzard notes with red text and emphasis, there is just one opportunity to merge accounts. Make sure you check which accounts are being merged when you do so.
The Blizzard explainer goes into further detail, including addressing a few specific circumstances some players might run into during the merge process. All of this should serve to provide a central platform, similar to games like Fortnite, where cosmetics purchased in one place will be available on the others as well.
One giant closet of cosmetics
As Overwatch 2 moves the game from loot boxes to passes and a shop, having that access is a good thing. It&#x27;s doubly so, since Overwatch 2 will also be taking the place of Overwatch on its launch; like a massive title update for the multiplayer side. The single-player part of Overwatch 2, meanwhile, is expected to arrive sometime later on in the future.
Overwatch 2 will go live and free-to-play on October 4 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.

The shrunken backyard antics of Grounded shine bright in co-op, as it&#x27;s fun to build a base together that everyone can enjoy, and, y&#x27;know, spiders are just less intimidating when you&#x27;ve got backup. In the home stretch before the 1.0 release of Grounded on September 27, Obsidian announced a Shared Worlds feature to make multiplayer less of a hassle.
Here&#x27;s the idea: You&#x27;ll be able to create a Shared World that lives in the cloud and lets other players hop in even when you aren&#x27;t around to host it. In other words, less time getting everyone&#x27;s schedule on the same page, and more time smashing bugs.
In a forum post this week, Obsidian walked through the work-in-progress Shared Worlds feature and its benefits, som…</span>

                              <span>The studio is ramping up even more
Team Asobi seems to have big plans on the horizon. In the wake of launching its latest game, Astro&#x27;s Playroom, as a PlayStation 5 pack-in title, its next project will be its biggest one yet.
In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, creative and studio director Nicolas Doucet talks about some of what Asobi&#x27;s been up to post-Playroom. Team Asobi is looking to keep tooling around with the DualSense, a key part of Astro&#x27;s Playroom. And it&#x27;s also looking to expand in scope, too.
Doucet says Asobi&#x27;s next game will follow in the footsteps of its previous games, will be a full-blown commercial title, and will be the &quot;biggest to date&quot; for the studio.
The team at Asobi has been steadily expanding, going from 35 to 60 members. Doucet expects that number to reach around 100. And the makeup is largely Japanese, which Doucet says the team wants to reflect in the games they make.
&quot;We want to make sure that when people play our games that there is a feeling, and you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on it, that it&#x27;s made in Japan,&quot; said Doucet. You can find the full interview with GIbiz here.

Astro&#x27;s evolution
Team Asobi has been on a steady rise for some time. Astro Bot Rescue Mission was considered one of the better PlayStation VR games around. And Astro&#x27;s Playroom was a delightful pack-in console launch game. The platformer harbored tons of nostalgia for the history of PlayStation and its hardware.
Doucet and the team at Asobi have a clear penchant for working with the nuances of Sony&#x27;s hardware. The studio lead says there&#x27;s an extra team on the side at Asobi, always working on the technology and R&amp;D. Where Asobi goes with the DualSense and its next big project, its biggest yet, will be exciting to see.

MultiVersus season one is now officially underway, and over the coming weeks, a steady drop of brand new content will go live in Warner Bros.&#x27; super-popular platform brawler. And, as leaked by the Xbox dash yesterday, two new characters joining the star-studded roster are DC Comics anti-hero Black Adam, and the mischievous-to-the-point-of-deadly gremlin, Stripe.
As is the modus operandi of sneaky PC types, dataminers wasted zero time digging into the files of MultiVersus&#x27; season one update — hoping to find any and all evidence of some unannounced DLC characters. And it seems that their search was a smashing success, after the discovery of a huge batch of voice lines spouted by the irrepressible Beetlejuice, the unpredictable and darkly witty &quot;bio-exorcist&quot; from Tim Burton&#x27;s class…</span>

In a new horror-themed management sim from Unfold Games, you&#x27;ll play as a vampire fresh out of hibernation with a dusty estate to renovate and deck out. One of my favorite parts of games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the early stages — the clean-up process before you settle into your daily business-as-usual routine. And from our first playfully animated look at Bloody Hell Hotel, there&#x27;s much to do.
The announcement trailer debuted on IGN today, and it moves fast.

The vampire protagonist practically wields force powers in the footage, which I kind of love. How the minute-to-minute experience of Bloody Hell Hotel holds up remains to be seen, but as a foot-in-the-door pi…</span>

[Update: Literal minutes after this story went live, Saber Interactive officially revealed that Mia Allen will arrive in Evil Dead: The Game next month as part of the season one DLC pass.]
Very exciting news for fans of Evil Dead: The Game, as developer Saber Interactive appears to be teasing the arrival of a brand new DLC character. And it appears to be none of than Mia Allen, the gore-covered, deadite-smashing, skin-peeling star of the stellar 2013 reboot of Sam Raimi&#x27;s 1981 horror classic.
Helmed and co-written by Fede Álvarez in his directorial debut, Evil Dead reimagines the unholy tale of the absolute nightmare that besieges a group of friends staying at an isolated log cabin. With the goal of supporting Mia as she attempts to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; on her heroi…</span>

[Update: Unity&#x27;s board of directors has unanimously voted to reject AppLovin&#x27;s $17.5 billion merger proposal. Calling the deal &quot;not in the best interests of Unity shareholders,&quot; Unity is now expected to continue with its previous plans to merge with mobile software firm IronSource. As noted in the original article below, backing out of the IronSource deal was a key condition of the AppLovin proposal.
&quot;We remain committed to and enthusiastic about Unity’s agreement with IronSource and the substantial benefits it will create for our shareholders and Unity creators,&quot; said Unity CEO John Riccitiello of the decision. &quot;The board continues to believe that the IronSource transaction is compelling and will deliver an opportunity to generate long-term value.&quot; — Reuters]

VSFighting, perhaps the UK&#x27;s most prestigious fighting game tournament, will make its grand return this week for the first time in three years. Players from across the UK, Europe, and wider international communities will gather together once again in a bid to lay claim to bragging rights in some of today&#x27;s (and even some of yesterday&#x27;s) hottest scrappers.
The annual throwdown, which has run yearly since its inception in 2010, has been on hiatus since 2019 — impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown rulings. The coming weekend will see the 10th iteration of the tournament, once again hosted by West Midlands FGC Electronic Dojo, return to the Millennium Point complex in Birmingham for three days of sweet &#x27;n&#x27; salty action.

Well, the teaser was sent out, and now the time has come: Dragon Ball is entering Fortnite. Here&#x27;s how the Dragon Ball x Fortnite event works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;XiOn8wQmiAk
Currently, Epic has implemented two big items into the mix:
Nimbus Cloud (an on-demand glider that lets you shoot into the air to glide with a cooldown timer, similar to other past items)
Kamehameha (an ability that&#x27;s essentially an explosive beam, governed by a maximum of three charges)
You can find these items either through special vendors (Bulma at Kame House on the far east of the map in the island formation), &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; vending machines (marked on the map), or through capsules, which appear on the map like supply drops.

The verdict centers around roughly 2,000 infringing videos that were uploaded to the platform. The Court affirms that Vimeo plays an “active role” and can&#x27;t hide behind a safe harbor defense.

                              <span>The RTX 3090 Ti is the fastest consumer graphics card Nvidia has ever made - but the rumoured imminent arrival of their RTX 4090 graphics card means that it&#x27;s now going for nearly £700 below its original £1879 UK RRP. In fact, you can now pick up one of these graphics cards for less than £1200, just £100 more than the launch price of the RTX 2080 Ti for around 75% more performance.

                              <span>The Razer Huntsman Mini Analog is one of a vanishingly small number of keyboards with analogue switches, meaning each key knows exactly how far down it&#x27;s being pressed. That unlocks the door to some unique capabilities, from adjusting the sensitivity of the keyboard on the fly to using the WASD keys as a thumbstick replacement in racing games. It&#x27;s also just a damn fine mechanical keyboard, with a comfortable 60% size, bright RGB lighting and premium PBT keycaps. 
You normally pay a lot for this kind of quality and functionality - £150, in fact - but today the keyboard has dropped to its lowest ever price of £97.94 over at Amazon UK.

If you’re escaping a dystopian prison system where you can pay to upgrade to invisible handcuffs, your escape may as well have a jamming soundtrack. But you&#x27;ll have to bring your own, because the world in Keylocker hates that stuff. Like in Footloose, music is an illegal activity.

The tractor computer was hacked by Sick Codes, who’s trying to draw attention to farming equipment manufacturers who lock down their products to prevent owners from repairing them.

Your reputation precedes you: before the accused can even sit down, they call out your unusual ability to hack into the minds of people to ‘patch’ their flaws, turning their nefarious intentions into fields of flowers. But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.


So, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the &#x27;bug&#x27; in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?

                              <span>Instead of commanding a group of rugged, blood-soaked mercenaries on a turn-based death crawl through unimaginable horrors, how about a neo-Victorian circus troupe brawling with biomechatronic Londoners? That&#x27;s Circus Electrique, a turn-based RPG that&#x27;s much more lighthearted than its Darkest Dungeon counterpart (and seemingly main inspiration). But after playing a preview of the game’s first mission, there&#x27;s more than meets the eye in this part steampunk RPG, part circus tycoon management sim.
You play as Amelia, a young, bold journalist returning to London to cover the grand re-opening of the Circus Electrique. A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.

                              <span>MarkMonitor has asked a Florida federal court to destroy or permanently seal documents discussing its anti-piracy systems. The information could be beneficial to &quot;pro-piracy&quot; forces, MarkMonitor fears. The documents are part of a now-settled lawsuit between record labels and ISP Bright House. Interestingly, the destruction request piqued the interest of another ISP: Cox.

A local online store managed to get some Steam activation keys but sold out, despite selling them for close to the most expensive price in the world. Right now, Russians can either wait for new stock or take advantage of the game being cracked on day one.

                              <span>Developer KeokeN Interactive has delayed its upcoming adventure game Deliver Us Mars to next year. 
More specifically, the Red Planet sequel to Deliver Us The Moon will no longer be released on September 27 and will instead hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 2, 2023. That&#x27;s a delay of roughly four-ish months. As for why, KeokeN Interactive released a statement alongside the news, citing that the game needs more time to be the best it can possibly be.

More specifically, the showcase will begin at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 9, and will be hosted by Kinda Funny&#x27;s Blessing Adeoye Jr. It is set to feature &quot;incredible new content&quot; from Disney &amp; Pixar Games, Marvel Games, Lucasfilm Games, and 20th Century Games. This includes titles like Disney Dreamlight Valley, Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and even a &quot;sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media.&quot;

You might recognize Skydance New Media as the studio where former Uncharted series director Amy Hennig works as president. Connecting those dots means the sneak peek at the upcoming ensemble game from Skydance New Media is the first sneak peek of Hennig&#x27;s new game, which she revealed as a narrative-driven, action-adventure game last year. 
Considering it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be any number of famous Marvel squads or families. However, it&#x27;s probably a safe bet to assume it won&#x27;t be the Avengers since Crystal Dynamic&#x27;s Avengers is only two years old and still getting updates. We also know it won&#x27;t be the Midnight Suns, as XCOM developer Firaxis is developing that. I&#x27;m hoping Hennig&#x27;s game is based on the X-Men, but since it&#x27;s an ensemble game, it could be something like the Inhumans, the Fantastic Four, or even the New Avengers, too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we have less than a month of waiting to go because the Disney and Marvel Games Showcase airs on Sept. 9.

                              <span>Private Division, a publishing arm under the Take-Two Interactive umbrella, has signed a publishing agreement with Wētā Workshop to publish the studio’s new Lord of the Rings game. 
Wētā Workshop is the VFX studio behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and in 2014, it founded a video game division. That team is now developing a “new game set in the Middle-earth universe of J.R.R. Tolkien,” according to a press release. Middle-earth Enterprises has licensed the literary works of the series to Wētā Workshop, too, giving the studio “the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books.” 
“We are thrilled to partner with Wētā Workshop to publish a game set in such an extraordinary and celebrated universe,” Private Division head Michael Worosz writes in a press release. “The Lord of the Rings IP is home to so many remarkable stories, and no entity is better equipped than the team at Wētā Workshop to create a distinctive, new Middle-earth gaming experience.” 
Wētā Workshop’s gaming lead, Amie Wolken, says it&#x27;s a privilege to create a new game set in Middle-earth, especially one that’s going to be “so different from what fans have played previously.” 
“As a fan ourselves, we’re excited for gamers to explore Middle-earth in a way they never have before, and introduce new fans to the magic of The Lord of the Rings,” Wolken writes in the press release. 
This new Lord of the Rings game does not yet have a title and is early in development. It doesn’t have a release date either, but it’s expected to launch sometime during Take-Two’s Fiscal Year 2024 (April 2023 - March 2024). 
While waiting to learn more about this game, check out the latest gameplay from The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, which was recently delayed out of its Sept. 1 release date by a few months. Watch this teaser from the upcoming Amazon Middle-earth TV show, The Lord of the Rings:​ The Rings of Power, after that.

The movie seems to be early in development, although it did land Takashi Doscher as its writer earlier this year, but we might have some new information about it straight from a recent interview with Stehelski. 
More specifically, Stehelski revealed to Collider that the movie might feature an entirely Japanese cast and that the film could be in Japanese. Plus, he says Sony is on board with the idea. Here’s what he had to say:
This sounds awesome, but with the project being so early in development, anything could change. It’s great to hear that Sony’s on board with the idea, though!

However, we do know that Morty from Rick and Morty will join the roster next week on Aug. 23.

                              <span>As a non-player, the trailer for Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s Patch 6.2, Buried Memory, is indistinguishable from every other patch trailer. There&#x27;s enormous boss monsters, several types of void, an incongruous cat creature, Death maybe... Where it differs is that there are also a few glimpses of the Island Sanctuary, FFXIV&#x27;s new solo farming content. 

Watch it below ahead of the newly announced release date: August 23rd.

                              <span>Gothic was one of those PC games I dismissed as being for nerds. Me? I was too busy making Half-Life levels and reading Championship Manager fanfic to be interested in some game about mages in a hole. 

I&#x27;ve since realised the errors of my ways, and I quite fancy the chance to correct my previous wrongs via the Gothic 1 remake. There&#x27;s a new trailer for it and its big modern hole below.

                              <span>Bungie has been permitted to seek overseas cooperation under the Hague Convention to obtain evidence on a Destiny 2 cheat seller. The developer filed a copyright lawsuit against the alleged operator of Lavicheats in 2021 but almost a year later progress is slow. In addition to conducting discovery in the US, Bungie has an eye on the UK but whether that will bear fruit is another question.

                              <span>The more time I spend with Valve’s Steam Deck, the more I’m fascinated by it. While it’s obviously rad for the incredibly rich selection of games it plays, I’ve found it’s actually a really solid mini-PC for work, creation, and just everyday PC-related tasks, so today I’ll show you how to get started using your Deck…

                              <span>Let’s rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise, and this episode takes aim at the lauded yet somewhat polarizing Devil May Cry 4. 
Devil May Cry 4 took the series to a new generation of hardware, including Xbox for the first time. That&#x27;s only one of the many firsts for this entry. Capcom moved Dante aside to place newcomer Nero in the starring role, who brought his demon arm Devil Bringer as the new centerpiece mechanic. Dante wasn&#x27;t completely shunned, however; players control him during the adventure&#x27;s questionably designed back half. In this episode, we&#x27;ll discuss DMC 4&#x27;s bizarre 2005 reveal, Capcom&#x27;s reasoning behind Nero&#x27;s conception, the fan reaction to the Xbox launch, and what it&#x27;s really like to visit Fortuna&#x27;s inspiration, Vatican City. 
Join hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7) and the returning host of The Great Game Debate podcast Wes Bates (@GreatGameDeb8), as we unpack Nero&#x27;s big debut.

                              <span>Arguing over which Halo game is the best is an exercise in futility. Fact: They’re all amazing! For the past two decades, first under Bungie, then under 343 Industries, Halo has put on a master class of tone, pacing, and raw, punchy first-person gameplay. But perfection is non-existent; just as most every Halo game…

Dozens of targeted subscribers, who are seen as the most prolific pirates, have filed objections at the Colorado federal court. While privacy concerns are understandable, the subscribers themselves don&#x27;t appear to be at risk.

                              <span>Software sold by market leaders tend to be primary purchases for regular consumers. Brand comfort is important but so too is affordability, especially when pirate copies are available for free. Some find a middle ground with purchases of discounted activation keys but, as a new Microsoft lawsuit shows, that can amount to copyright infringement for buyers and sellers alike.

Gathered after a tragedy befalls our group, I attempt to calm down and plea that we should trust one another. Blood’s been spilled, and tensions are at an all-time high for this lost party of teens trapped in a dangerous land. That’s not quite the scene I had imagined going into Digimon Survive, a tactical RPG by way of a visual novel based on the sometimes-kid-friendly monster franchise. The dramatic dynamics at play are gripping, but the grid-based battles left me snoozing, souring what could have been a compelling, complete package.

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 3 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 
Watch on Twitch!
Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!</span>

                              <span>Developer Avalanche and publisher Warner Bros. Interactive have delayed Hogwarts Legacy to next year. 
More specifically, Hogwarts Legacy, originally due out sometime this year, will now hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 10, 2023. The game will make its way to Switch, too, but today&#x27;s announcement also came with the news that the Switch version will launch at a later date.

                              <span>Infinity Ward has released a TikTok (it’s a new world) that shows some of its developers discussing a new map in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 called Farm 18, as reported by Eurogamer. 
The map will probably fall into the medium-sized range of Call of Duty maps, and that’s because it’s one part a level set in an abandoned and overgrown cement factory and another part, Shoothouse, the popular level from 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Of course, it’s not a 1-to-1 recreation, but Infinity Ward says Farm 18’s center, which is a large shoot house, was inspired by Modern Warfare’s Shoothouse.
Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, the map looks like it’s going to be a great time. Players looking to play it safe can stick to the outside, using the overgrown brush to conceal them while stalking the level’s perimeter. Those looking for a riskier fight can head into the central warehouse, where they’ll find themselves in the Shoothouse-inspired part of Farm 18.

                              <span>If you’ve drooled over the OLED panel in your phone or TV and decided you’d like the same tech for your PC games, you basically have the choice of a single model each from Gigabyte and Alienware. Asus, then, are about to increase the number of OLED gaming monitors on the market by 100%, with the ROG Swift PG48UQ and ROG Swift PG42UQ. And I’ve just had a brief, but generally impressive, play around with them.

                              <span>Of the many games announced during THQ Nordic&#x27;s Showcase this evening, Space For Sale is the one that caught my eye the most, primarily because it looks a bit like Animal Crossing with aliens. In it, you play a small stubby astronaut who dreams of hitting it big as an intergalactic property developer. Man, they really took the phrase &#x27;colony sim&#x27; to its literal extreme, didn&#x27;t they? Are we sure that isn&#x27;t Tom Nook under the helmet there? The proportions defintiely seem right, is all I&#x27;m saying. I just hope the rent you end up charging isn&#x27;t... astronommical. Sorry. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

This time it&#x27;s a reimagining of the original 1992 game, where you&#x27;ll delve into Derceto Manor as returning characters Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby in an attempt to figure out what&#x27;s happened to Hartwood&#x27;s missing uncle. As you&#x27;d expect, it does not go terribly well. But hey, it looks like it makes for a pretty good time.

It&#x27;s called Wreckreation (you know, like &#x27;recreation&#x27;, not Wreck-reaction, or Wreck–eation) and its reveal trailer looks a bit like if Burnout and Hot Wheels went for a joyride together.

Well, Ghostrunner and Graven devs Slipgate Ironworks hope to provide an answer with their latest real-time tactics base-building game, Tempest Rising. Revealed earlier this evening during THQ Nordic&#x27;s summer showcase, Tempest Rising is a retro-inspired strategy game where you&#x27;ll take control of three factions fighting for a rare mineral. And yep, that mineral is called &#x27;Tempest&#x27;. Here&#x27;s the reveal trailer.

                              <span>As many of you well know, I rather enjoyed cat adventure Stray recently. As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, it was right up my alley. I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven&#x27;t shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat&#x27;s in-game meow. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.
However, I&#x27;m beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they&#x27;ll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it&#x27;s like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.

                              <span>&quot;Metroidvania&quot; is a terrible phrase that gets in the way of its own definition and I hate it.


It does, however, still apply to Zapling Bygone. Describing it in less mechanical terms could make it sound creepy. You&#x27;re a spore of an all-consuming hivemind, dropped on an unfamiliar planet to assimilate it. You move by skittering about on wobbly green tentacles, leaping and climbing and clinging and lashing out at living things with them, then absorbing the green muck that bursts out, and periodically consuming a creature powerful enough to be worth assimilating. And wearing its skull in the centre of your tentacle mass, because why not.

                              <span>This is a bit different from what we normally cover, but I was going to order this for myself and thought it might be of interest to you, dear reader, as well. Anyway, you can get ten years&#x27; worth of AA batteries - 100 in total! - for just £13 at Amazon right now. This normally costs £18, so that&#x27;s a nice little savings - and of course it&#x27;s far cheaper per item than buying batteries in smaller packs.

                              <span>The Crucial X8 is our favourite portable SSD, thanks to its compact protective frame, convenient USB-A or USB-C connection and excellent performance. It&#x27;s capable of transfer speeds up to 1050MB/s, minimising the time it takes to copy files to and from the drive, and offers low enough access times that you can easily run games from it too. It normally costs around £85, but today it&#x27;s dropped to a historic low price of £77 - a great value for a portable NVMe SSD offering this level of performance.

You can&#x27;t deal with losing it now. Oh god, let it stay there. Not now. Please, not now. But it happened (of course it did!). And you know what? You&#x27;re okay. It wasn&#x27;t the end of the world.

Co-developers Insomniac Games and Nixxes, who spoke to me this week about the port&#x27;s development, have also taken the care to festoon this version of the open-world crim-puncher with various Windows-exclusive features. These span enhanced ray traced reflections and ultrawide monitor support to both Nvidia DLSS and (surprisingly, given it wasn’t in the initial PC features trailer) AMD FSR 2.0, adding to a list of visual options that already stretches into the sky like a Manhattan high rise. Let’s take a look, then, at how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered performs on PC – as well as the best settings to keep it swingin’ real smooth like.

As a counterpoint to the episode on the nicest blokes to hang out with in games, we&#x27;ve decided to talk about our most hated NPCs (a bonus prize to anyone who can guess which is the one we all say first). It&#x27;s an interesting one to discuss, because the line between intentionally annoying and unintentionally annoying can be very thin. Plus everyone tends to find different things annoying. Disclaimer: you are not annoying, any similarities you have to characters we find annoying are coincidental.

                              <span>In a year riddled with delays, Metal Slug Tactics is the latest game to slip into next year. Publisher Dotemu has announced that the tactical spin-off of the popular shoot &#x27;em up needs more time to come together and will launch in 2023.
The tweet, embedded below, doesn’t elaborate more than that. We haven&#x27;t heard much of a peep about the game since its reveal last summer, making us wonder if a delay was on the horizon.
Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma are tinkering away to make #MetalSlugTactics as explosive as possible on release, but the squad needs a bit more time in the shop to prepare for the battles ahead. See you in 2023! @LeikirStudio x @Dotemu

Metal Slug Tactics was one of the pleasant surprises of E3 2021. The game, developed by Leikir Studio, transforms the series’ explosive run-and-gun action into a tile-based tactics experience that retains Metal Slug’s signature style and tone. Although turn-based, units still wield classic Metal Slug weapons and can be improved by unlocking abilities and perks on a skill tree.
We’ll have to wait a while longer to see how well Metal Slug translates to this new template. When it does arrive, it will be available on Switch and PC.</span>

It seems cool, so I&#x27;ll play it with former Associate Editor John Carson today!
We&#x27;re going live at 2:00 p.m. Central on our Twitch page, and then I&#x27;ll upload it to the Game Informer YouTube channel afterward. See you soon.</span>

Your followers’ faith in your cult drives everything in Cult of the Lamb. If you fail to keep them fed and happy, or if you decline their sub-quests too much, or even simply neglect to clean up their poop, their faith will drop. Any kind of wrongdoing, neglect, or slight against them, can cause them to lose faith in y…</span>

                              <span>Nightingale, the Victorian first-person survival action game, has had its early access launch pushed to the first half of 2023. The game is the debut by Inflexion Games, a team consisting of former Bioware developers, including ex-general manager Aaron Flynn. 
In a message posted to Twitter, Inflexion explains it delayed the launch for two reasons. One, it’s migrating the game to Unreal Engine 5. Two, it needs the extra time to ensure it&#x27;s polished and packed with content before players can begin testing it out. You can read Inflexion&#x27;s full message below (click the image to enlarge). 
Nightingale debuted during The Game Awards 2021 and is a PvE crafting and survival game that can be played alone or in co-op. Players find themselves stranded in a Victorian Gaslamp fantasy world connected by a network of portals. To survive, they’ll have to harvest materials such as wood and ore to construct weapons, equipment, and buildings. Jumping through portals transports players to new biomes such as deserts, swamps, and jungles. Nightingale’s appearance during this year’s Summer Game Fest introduced Realm Cards used to unlock new areas and influence the type of content, such as enemies and resources, they contain. 
So far, Nightingale is only confirmed to launch for PC via Steam.</span>

                              <span>Developer PanicBarn and publisher No More Robots are working on a &quot;comedy open-world RPG&quot; where you save the world with a magic soccer ball. Soccer Story is slated to release later this year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and Stadia.
Your role in Soccer Story begins one year after an event called The Calamity, which apparently has made soccer illegal. A magic soccer ball chooses you to be the so-called Savior of Soccer, a role that will also help heal the world.
No More Robots states Soccer Story delivers over 15 hours of gameplay unfolding through story-based missions and side activities. You&#x27;ll apparently square off against sharks, toddlers, old-age pensioners, and ninjas as you complete these tasks and solve puzzles using the ball.
In addition to the single-player campaign, Soccer Story features a four-player local multiplayer mode, with each team led by an animal captain.
Soccer Story is not developed by SideBar Games, the team behind the wonderful Golf Story title, but it does appear to draw plenty of inspiration from it, including the name.

                              <span>For weeks now, leaks and rumors have pointed to a Dragon Ball Z collaboration happening with Epic Games&#x27; battle royale, Fortnite. Now, such a crossover has been officially confirmed. 
Today, the official Fortnite Twitter account tweeted out an image of Shenron floating high above the battle island with a caption that says, &quot;Speak. Name your wish...8.16.2022.&quot; Check it out for yourself below:

As you can see, it seems Epic Games will finally unveil the Dragon Ball Z content coming to Fortnite next Tuesday. As for what to expect, that remains officially unknown, but leaks (and, let&#x27;s be honest, a solid guess) point to skins of popular Dragon Ball Z characters such as Goku and Vegeta and DBZ-specific pickups too. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now. 
Prepare your wallets.

                              <span>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet that showcases many of the minigames we&#x27;ll be partaking in when the game hits Switch. 
And speaking of Switch, today&#x27;s overview trailer reveals that Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is out next week, on Wednesday, Aug. 17. That&#x27;s exciting, especially considering this game was only just announced last month. The trailer details the main progression of games in Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, as well as important ways to strategize using Kirby&#x27;s different copy abilities. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet is shaping up to be an adorably cute time (not to mention, a hunger-inducing one too).

Warner Bros. has given new studio Player First Games some of its most popular characters to carve out space in the Smash Bros.-dominated IP-crossover-fighter genre. MultiVersus succeeds where others have failed, but it still has some growing to do.

Documents obtained by TorrentFreak suggest another incoming credibility boost - via HBO&#x27;s lawyers in California.

                              <span>How much gaming monitor can you get for £100? Not much, it turns out - but I did spot something unexpected for £10 more: a genuine ultra-wide monitor. Now, it&#x27;s not a stunner as far as looks go, and it&#x27;s not got the latest specs either. But what it has got is an expansive 25-inch span, a 2560x1080 resolution and a blistering refresh rate of... 75Hz. OK, so it&#x27;s far from the best gaming monitor on the planet, but getting an IPS monitor of this size is honestly not bad going - especially as it&#x27;s been reduced from a UK RRP of £170.

                              <span>I was a bit sad when Square Enix announced last month that PC players would be missing out on the first demo for their upcoming strategy game The DioField Chronicle, but happily the RPG giant has reconsidered their tactical options and released it on Steam after all. The move coincides with pre-orders also going live, but the good news is that your save data, progress and character levels from the demo will all transfer over to the final game should you decide to take the plunge in full when the game comes out on September 22nd.

Cameras won by only eight votes, so you&#x27;d better join in if you feel strongly about this week&#x27;s face-off. And this one might involve taking a face... off.

It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I&#x27;m standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.

You know Spider-Man. He&#x27;s a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that&#x27;s its spin-off/sequel Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that&#x27;s not on PC yet. This means Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn&#x27;t a bad consolation prize.

                              <span>When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn&#x27;t an unrealistic thing to expect?
After spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I&#x27;m thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve&#x27;s handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.

                              <span>A bright sun heralds the start of day 37 for CultPaperShotgun. Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night&#x27;s revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult&#x27;s garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.
Where am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I&#x27;m kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.
This, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.

First published in Japan last year, Swery took to Twitter yesterday to announce its English translation by Dan Luffey is now available digitally. You might want to sit down for the synopsis, though. It sounds wild.

                              <span>Some of the early trailers for Forspoken, a Squeenix action-adventure/RPG epic coming in January, suggested portentious world-saving stuff. This is a different vibe to a clip shared on Forspoken&#x27;s offical Twitter this week, which featured main character Frey Holland doing a &quot;Yup, that&#x27;s me!&quot; kind of elevator pitch for the game. A lot of people on the birdsite took an instant, vehement dislike to Frey&#x27;s dialogue, and were just as instantly sure who to blame for the peachy keen quiplashing, even if by proxy. Yes, Joss Whedon strikes again.

                              <span>You know when a game instantly charms the socks off you the moment you first clap eyes on it? Point and click puzzler Lost In Play is one of those games for me. Its vibrant cartoon visuals immediately caught my attention when I first sampled its Steam Next Fest demo earlier in the year, and I&#x27;m happy to report that the full game, out today, is just as captivating as it was back then. 
It tells the tale of Toto and Gal, a pair of rambunctious siblings who end up far from home after getting lost inside a fantasy world of their own imagining. If they don&#x27;t find a way back before nightfall, though, they&#x27;ll be stuck there forever. A classic kids adventure story, in other words, but one that really relishes in its own sense of playfulness. Over the course of their four-odd hour adventure, they&#x27;ll meet monster fighting frogs in a dark forest, board game-playing seagulls on the high seas, orc mechanics in a vast desert and even a heavy-metal loving sheep on a floating island in the sky as they make their way home  to their messy childhood bedroom. It all makes for some memorable puzzling backdrops, but be warned: if you&#x27;re planning to play this with little ones, then you&#x27;ll definitely need a puzzle savvy adult in the mix, as some of its brainteasers aren&#x27;t quite as child-friendly as you might expect.

As of today, Farthest Frontier is now in early access.

                              <span>Snow Blind, the next installment in the Mortal Kombat Legends animated film series, got its first trailer today ahead of its October release. The new movie tells the origin story of Kenshi, who tags up with Sub-Zero to kombat Outworld&#x27;s usual suspects and keep the peace (or as peaceful as this universe can get). 
The film explores how Kenshi loses his eyesight and trains to become the master swordfighter that fans have loved since his debut in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Kenshi’s goal: take down a fully cybernetic Kano and his Black Dragon clan. Kenshi has another ace up his sleeve in the form of a powerful ally (?) in Sub-Zero. Some of the characters that appear include Shang Tsung and Kabal and even lesser seen faces like Tremor and Kira. 


Snow Blind is the third Mortal Kombat Legends film following 2021’s Battle of the Realms and 2020’s Scorpion’s Revenge. It will be available on digital storefronts on October 9 and on Blu-ray October 11. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to see where it winds up landing on my ranking of every Mortal Kombat on-screen adaptation.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m recovering from my recent trip to Las Vegas for EVO – the long-standing fighting game championship that invites competitors worldwide. The event is home to vendors, artists, demos for upcoming fighting games, and massive stages where only the best compete in front of thousands of fighting game fans. While on-site for the event, former Game Informer editor John Carson and I traveled to the top floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort with a camera to meet the Arcade1Up folks and play the recently announced Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 cabinet for ourselves. 
Here&#x27;s the video: 


If you&#x27;re looking for more information on the Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 Arcade1Up cabinet, read our news story about the announcement. Here&#x27;s a snippet:
One of the most beloved fighting games of all time is finally getting the Arcade1Up treatment. Marvel vs. Capcom 2, the legendary crossover extravaganza from 2000, is the latest game featured by the replica arcade cabinet company. 
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 gathers 56 playable heroes and villains from both Marvel and Capcom&#x27;s robust catalogs of characters in an over-the-top 3v3 fighting game. In addition to giving you something approximating the original arcade experience through this replica cabinet, the Arcade1Up release also features online play via Wi-Fi.</span>

I loved Animal Crossing: New Horizons back in 2020, but its premise wasn’t enough to keep me engaged over time. Designing my island and keeping all of the villagers on it happy was thoroughly enjoyable, but after a few dozen hours, I craved a new type of gameplay to coincide with what I was doing each day. Cult of the Lamb, a mish-mash of adorably cute animals, critters, and creatures and macabre cult-isms, remedies that issue with an expansive action-combat dungeon system. I only wish its base building provided …</span>

To this point, Splatoon 3 has drip-fed players with new information about new weapons, music, and even a special Switch OLED model and Pro Controller themed after the highly anticipated family-friendly shooter. However, now that Splatoon 3 is the next major release on the Switch&#x27;s release calendar, Nintendo officially opened the flood gates this morning with a wealth of information through a special Nintendo Direct all about the ink-covered shooter. 
Splatoon 3 leaves behind Inkopolis in favor of Splatsville, which is out in the heart of the Splatlands. Splatsville is a growing city that has rece…</span>

                              <span>After weeks of videos individually showcasing Gotham Knights’ Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl, it’s Jason Todd’s turn in the spotlight. A new trailer shows off Red Hood’s brutal, more supernatural approach to battling the Court of Owls.
The in-engine footage showed off the former Robin’s deadly competency with firearms as well his Lazarus Pit-induced powers, such as his spectral leaping ability. We also get a look at a unique cosmetic skin featuring a horned helmet that gives off serious Darth Maul vibes. 


We&#x27;ll see how the Bat family manages on its own when Gotham Knights swoops in on October 25 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>We learned in June during the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase that Persona 5 Royal would be coming to Xbox consoles alongside Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable. 
With an official Xbox Series X/S version of the game coming out on Oct. 21, and the remastered version set to hit other consoles then too, we’re just a few months away from seeing what the full JRPG looks like running on a new-gen console. Now we have our best look yet, featuring Persona 5 Royal running at 60 FPS on an Xbox Series X, thanks to Faz on YouTube, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


As you can see, Persona 5 Royal looks wildly different running at 60 FPS. Personally, and this is shocking for me to say, I think I prefer it running at 30 FPS. I was chatting with a friend about this last night, but the animation of the game and its general art style lend themselves well to 30 FPS. This remastered 60 FPS look almost takes away some of the shine from the game, giving characters and enemies a matte-like finish. Perhaps it will look better in the final release, but right now, I think I will stick to my PlayStation 4 version.

                              <span>Two Point Campus opened its door today, and we think it’s pretty darn good. But what does a real college professor think? Sega answers this burning question by releasing a video of a qualified educator putting the simulator through its paces. 
Sega enlisted Tracy Fullerton, professor, and director of the game innovation lab at the Univerity of Southern California Games, to enroll in Two Point Campus and react to its zany brand of higher education. Besides providing a nice look at the moment-to-moment gameplay for those curious about the title, it&#x27;s fun to listen to Fullerton&#x27;s takes as both a game maker and a college professor. Check it out below. 


You can judge Two Point Campus for yourself on PlayStation and Xbox (including Game Pass), Switch, and PC.</span>

The biggest of the changes are to how summoning works, but there are also tweaks to quests, attack speeds, and bug fixes that&#x27;ll maybe not make you die less, but will at least make your deaths fairer.

                              <span>Update: the Iskur XL appears to be out of stock at Amazon and now back at a more regular price of £490. Original article follows below: 
The XL version of the Razer Iskur gaming chair is down to £287, nearly half the price it is on Razer&#x27;s official website and an all-time historic low price. Curiously, it&#x27;s also nearly £230 cheaper than the regular size version! Katharine reviewed that Iskur previously and rated it highly, so if this size fits you then this is a nice chance to pick it up at a very fair price.

                              <span>Unknown Worlds, the creators of Subnautica, and Krafton, the studio behind PUBG, have announced that they&#x27;ll be showing something at Gamescom later this month. What exactly? That I couldn&#x27;t tell you, but it&#x27;s apparently a turn-based game and an entirely new IP.

                              <span>Peter is a guy with his head in the clouds. Literally. Well, sort of. A climate science lecturer at Cambridge University, Peter&#x27;s great passion in life is cloud research. All he wants to do is study clouds: their different formations, their flight paths, their properties, everything. He finds them so fascinating that they&#x27;re the subject of his 100-page PhD thesis. It’s a poetic subject and one that matches his temperament as a boyish and awkward researcher. But around him the world is spiralling from the political tensions of the Cold War, and as much as Peter wishes to escape to in the clouds, current events are keeping him firmly tethered to the realities of an impending war. 
It’s this tension that makes South Of The Circle such an engrossing story. With player choices that subtly tug the game’s narrative needle in ways you might not expect, it&#x27;s clear skies and fair winds for the game’s three-hour journey. But with an abrupt ending after a calculated slow-burn drama, it&#x27;s a rough landing.

                              <span>Embark Studios, a young team of former DICE employees led by ex-EA head Patrick Söderlund, has delayed its upcoming shooter, Arc Raiders. The title was initially slated to arrive this year but will now launch in 2023. 
The reason is that the team has decided to pivot and focus on launching another team-based shooter codenamed Project Discovery. A blog post written by Söderlund explains that Embark has several projects in development and that Discovery progressed so quickly that it seemingly caught up to Arc Raiders, presenting the team with the possibility of shipping two games within the same timeframe. However, doing would&#x27;ve been more than the small team can handle. 
“For a young, relatively small studio like ours, releasing two games in short succession would have strained our teams and resources, many of which are shared between the two projects.” Söderlund explains. 
“As such, we decided to let Project Discovery be our studio’s first game to market, pushing Arc Raiders to a 2023 release. It’s a decision that will also allow us to expand and refine the Arc Raiders experience.”
Outside of being a team-based first-person shooter, little is known about Project Discovery. The concept art posted above hints that it&#x27;s set in the current day or perhaps the near future. Söderlund promises to reveal more details “very soon.” 
Arc Raiders made its debut during the 2021 Game Awards and will be a free-to-play cooperative shooter where players work together to battle mechanical creatures from space. It will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Nyní se většinou nastavuje hostname až v user-space, případně při překladu jádra ( CONFIG_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME). Jsou ale některé případy, kdy je potřeba hostname ještě před přimoutováním /. Například mdadm potřebuje hostname a porovnává ho se záznamem homehost pro rozlišení lokálního pole a dočasně připojeného cizího pole.</span>

                              <span>Obsidian, the first supported game of the mTropolis engine, is ready for public testing!
Created in 1996 by Rocket Science Games and published in early 1997, this ambitious 3D-rendered first-person adventure has you journey through 4 surreal, dream-like worlds in search of your lost colleague.
ScummVM currently supports the English and German versions.  It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it. Please contact us if you have a copy of the Japanese version or some other language version that we haven&#x27;t discovered yet.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!

                              <span>Free your mind for yet another ScummVM release!
Nine newly supported games on 6 engines will plunge you into a variety of different settings. Are you able to escape from an alien-infested planet? What about challenging the Lord of the Dead in the Underworld? And have you ever explored the deepest depth of your psyche to see if you really know yourself?
Find out in one of the following titles:
Sanitarium
Hades Challenge
Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six
The 11th Hour
Clandestiny
Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)
Uncle Henry&#x27;s Playhouse
Wetlands
Chewy: Esc from F5
Besides adding new games, we are always focused on improving already supported games. Once again, we managed to squash quite a few bugs from various engines. It is always impressive to see bugs getting fixed in engines that are more than 20 years old!
One of the main new features of ScummVM 2.6.0 is a completely new way to view your games in an amazing icon grid overview via our launcher. Accompanied by some very shiny artwork provided by our graphics artists, you are now able to show off your collection like never before. It almost looks and feels like a virtual shelf!
Check out the full Release Notes for a comprehensive summary of how our developers managed to make ScummVM even more amazing!
You can find all of this goodness available for a number of platforms on our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS or the Ubuntu Snap package, the autoupdater will assist you in updating to ScummVM 2.6.0.
As always, thank you for your continuous support — happy adventuring!
