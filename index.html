                              <span>Update, 4/9/24:
Yesterday, players celebrated what they thought was the complete eradication of the Automaton Legion in Helldivers 2. The official Helldivers 2 X (formerly Twitter) account even tweeted about players&#x27; success in the galaxy. Now, roughly a day later, the Automatons have returned. 
&quot;Somehow, the Automatons returned. As suspected all along, the previous Bot force was merely a vanguard. A massive fleet how now begun an assault on Cyberstan and the surrounding planets. Helldivers, hold back this unprovoked invasion. The fight continues!&quot;
Somehow, the Automatons returned.

If you play Helldivers 2, you know this is probably going to be really, really bad. Have fun! Save democracy!

                              <span>Amazon Studios&#x27; Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. 
Walton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. 
If you haven&#x27;t yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: 


&quot;Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there&#x27;s almost nothing left to have,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.&quot; 
Amazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. 
Fallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. 
For more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer&#x27;s reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.

After checking the game out for a few hours and speaking to some of the lead developers at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, both myself and cover story writer Marcus Stewart are excited about No Rest for the Wicked – you can read more of our preview thoughts here, and you can read the cover story here. 
But, excitement for No Rest for the Wicked aside, both Marcus and I are big fans of the team&#x27;s Ori series, which began with Ori and the Blind Forest in 2015 and continued in the 2020 sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps. That&#x27;s why we couldn&#x27;t talk to Moon Studios about No Rest for the Wicked without asking how the team deci…</span>

While I&#x27;d argue climbing the ranked ladder with my housemates were some of the best game moments I&#x27;ve ever had, I&#x27;d also argue giving up League was necessary. I became too involved, too close to the toxicity. But now League&#x27;s threatening to drag me back in with something I hadn&#x27;t seen coming - a Vampire Survivors-like PVE mode. No! I must resist (I will be on it immediately when it arrives).

                              <span>Noita! A wizardly 2D dungeon crawler without compare, in both good and deranging ways. Man, it feels like only yesterday I equipped something without looking and suddenly everything that damaged me caused me to teleport at random. I flew through entire levels this way like a Tardis set to shuffle, bumbling into one enemy posse after another, granted a few seconds at a time to assess my surroundings before the sorcery swept me deeper. 
Behind me, meanwhile, whole layouts exploded as lakes of pixelated lava, acid and other substances which I’d nudged in passing overflowed and combined and transformed. Noita! Heaven help us all, they’ve released a big new update, after all these years.

                              <span>Fortnite&#x27;s big Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover is finally here, adding the entire Gaang to the battle royale... except for Sokka.


For context, the v29.20 patch for Fortnite includes skins for Katara, Toph, and Zuko, with Aang getting two skins as part of his own battle pass. Sokka, however, is completely absent despite being one of The Last Airbender&#x27;s main characters. He debuted in the very first episode and became one of Aang&#x27;s travelling companions long before Toph and Zuko joined them yet he&#x27;s nowhere to be seen in Fortnite. Not even his iconic boomerang made it in, though you can use his cool meteorite sword as a pickaxe.


Admittedly, there is something oddly fitting about Sokka not making it into Fortnite. He was typically the butt of jokes and was often overshadowed by his f…</span>

                              <span>The 29.1 update for PUBG: Battlegrounds has gone live, at least on PC, and it&#x27;s added destructible terrain, a new pickaxe weapon, and a Ducati crossover.


Destructible terrain is the most noteworthy inclusion since it opens up new strategies. One example publisher Krafton has given is making trenches you can use to avoid enemy fire. You can alter the terrain with some throwable items, like the Frag Grenade, and vehicle explosions, but also a new pickaxe weapon, which I&#x27;m sure will elicit some Fortnite comparisons. Any terrain made from concrete, cement, rock, or stone, though, can&#x27;t be destroyed, so you can&#x27;t go ham and blow everything up.




These new additions are also exclusive to the Rondo map, which was recently added to PUBG: Battlegrounds this past December. The 2024 roadmap Kraft…</span>

                              <span>Avatar: The Last Airbender&#x27;s crossover with Fortnite kicked into high gear on April 9, but Aang is missing. Here&#x27;s when you can get your hands on his skins, and everything you need to know about the Elements Pass.


When you boot up the game after the Fortnite v29.20 update, you&#x27;ll see Zuko, Katara, and Toph all available to purchase in the game&#x27;s Item Shop. Aang, the Avatar and main character of The Last Airbender, however, is nowhere to be seen, leaving fans who hoped to play as him disappointed. 


Don&#x27;t fear though, as he is coming to the battle royale, and we&#x27;ve got all the details.

When is Aang&#x27;s skin coming to Fortnite?


Aang is scheduled to arrive in Fortnite on Friday, April 12, 2024. He won&#x27;t be added to the Item Shop, however, as he will receive his own mini Battle Pass, aptly titled the Elements Pass.


How to unlock Aang skin in Fortnite


To unlock the skin, Avatar: The Last Airbender fans will need to purchase the Elements Pass, and then rank it up to eventually unlock the skins. This can be done by playing matches or completing challenges to earn XP rewards. 


What&#x27;s included in Fortnite&#x27;s Elements Pass?


There are nine items included in Fortnite&#x27;s Avatar: The Last Airbender Elements Pass:



Two Aang Skins with LEGO Fortnite versions


Aang Spray


Aang Banner


Aang Airbender emote


Momo Back Bling


Aang emoticon


Aang&#x27;s Staff Harvesting Tool



There&#x27;s plenty to unlock. Image via Epic Games


We&#x27;ll know more about the XP requirements when the Elements Pass goes live this Friday, and we&#x27;ll be sure to update this article once we have all the details.

The test is scheduled to run this weekend, starting from 2am PT / 5am ET / 10am BST on Friday, April 12, and ending at the same time on Monday, April 15. That&#x27;s plenty of time to get accustomed to Sea of Thieves&#x27; gameplay loop and mechanics. The downside is this isn&#x27;t a &#x27;try before you buy&#x27; situation. According to developer Rare, the only way to gain access to the beta is by pre-ordering Sea of Thieves on PS5.




This may be deflating for anyone still on the fence about checking Sea of Thieves out, especially with it no longer being an Xbox/PC exclusive. It may be a live service, but Sea of Thieves is…</span>

It&#x27;s not quite as common as Iron or Gold, but also not as rare as Corestone. Despite its usefulness, it can be difficult to find if you&#x27;re not sure exactly where to look. Here&#x27;s how and where to get Cloutium in Hydroneer: Journey to Volcalidus.

Best way to get Cloutium


In order to get Cloutium in Hydroneer: Journey to Volcalidus, you need to dig in the Tier 2 area of ice at a mining site. The starting site, Dawn Rest, is not deep enough to reach Tier 2. However, all of the other mining sites in the DLC go down to Tier 3, so you will have no problem finding Cloutium.


Once you&#x27;ve got access to one of the non-starter mining sites, you&#x27;ll need to dig down into the Tier 2 area …</span>

Funny Roblox Games


It&#x27;s not too difficult to make a funny Roblox game, simply because of how the game looks and plays. However, some definitely are more entertaining in a comical way than others. While there are some funny Roblox experiences that don&#x27;t really have much gameplay, we&#x27;ve opted to exclude those from this list and focus purely on those that have actual gameplay loops. Here&#x27;s the 10 funniest Roblox games  available to play now:

                              <span>Like weapon builds and FPS settings, aiming is vital throughout the various matches. The mechanic has been updated with numerous patches, making movement much smoother. However, since there are a variety of specs to choose from, we&#x27;re here to show you the best aim assist type in MW3 and Warzone.


Which aim assist type is the best in MW3 and Warzone?


Black Ops or Default are the best aim assist types in MW3 and Warzone. Both specs offer the traditional aim slowdown from past games, making it easier to shoot enemies. If you&#x27;re a BO player, then the Black Ops aim assist type is the obvious choice. On the other hand, Modern Warfare lovers should lean toward the Default, as it uses this series&#x27; mechanics.

                              <span>The staying power of Avatar: The Last Airbender cannot be understated. The original show ended in 2008, and yet, here we are in 2024, seeing much of the Airbender cast make their way to Fortnite. Starting tomorrow, April 9, Katara, Toph, and Zuko will be available in the game&#x27;s shop.


The current Battle Pass features Korra from the show&#x27;s sequel series, The Legend of Korra. As players began unlocking the sequel&#x27;s star, keen-eyed players individuals noticed an iceberg appearing in the northeastern corner of the map. Inside was a frozen orb containing Aang and his faithful Sky Bison, Appa. It was a great throwback to the original series, with Korra freeing him from his frozen Fortnite tomb in the animation above.  
However, if Katara, Zuko, and Toph are in the shop, how do we get the air-bending Avatar?


According to another tweet by the Fortnite team, that may be event dependent.  Another Fortnite event, Avatar: Element, begins on April 12. This will probably be in the form of a mini-pass, like Shredder was in the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles event. Also, where that event featured the classic weapons of the TMNT, I&#x27;m betting on elemental-based abilities available for pick-up.


As a huge fan of the series, I&#x27;m excited to see all of these Avatar events in Fortnite, and I&#x27;ve grown quite find of Korra&#x27;s water-bending powers in the battle royale. While I&#x27;m eager to get my hands on the rest of the announced cast, I&#x27;ve gotta ask: Epic  — where&#x27;s my boy, Sokka, at?

To avoid too shocking a transition, I looked at a lot of games that are not Pokémon, but that likely would not have been as good without the influence of Game Freak&#x27;s masterpiece.

10. Jade Cocoon


Let&#x27;s start with a blast from the past. Jade Cocoon was already showing off gorgeous 3D graphics while the Pokémon series was still stuck in the 2D confines of the GameBoy screen. Even better, on top of being a nice alternative to Pokémon, Jade Cocoon gave us a neat alternative to the Final Fantasy series. Yeah, even though Final Fan…</span>

Some of these mods were present in the early access version and have been updated for the full release. These are the best mods in Baldur’s Gate 3, adding plenty to Larian&#x27;s celebrated RPG in the form of strictly cosmetic bonuses or powerful, game-changing boosts. 


Before you can start using these mods in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to have the Full Release Mod Fixer downloaded. This enables the ability to use the other mods on this list, so it is essential. Additionally, as of a recent update from associate editor Andrea Shearon, we&#x27;ve got a little explainer at the end of this on how to install BG3 mods, it&#x27;s dangerous to go poking around in those files alone.

In the season three update, the Bruen MK9 had its minimum damage decreased from 26 to 24 and aim down sight speed down from 410 milliseconds to 350. On paper, both should have knocked the LMG out of contention for being a viable long-range meta weapon, but the damage downgrade came with a catch. Call of Duty content creator JGOD went into a Warzone match and manually tested what changed after the season three update. Surprisingly, The YouTuber discovered that the decreased damage only applies when firing at an enemy that is 400 meters away.

While it won&#x27;t always be smooth sailing with the threat of grotesque monsters, there are a few ways to maximize your group&#x27;s video-recording journey. So, here are the best Content Warning mods.

SkipIntroScreen


If you want to start your SpookTuber life early, use RamuneNeptune&#x27;s SkipIntroScreen mod. It&#x27;s a fairly self-explanatory add-on that skips the beginning scene instantly. Although Content Warning&#x27;s introduction already features a similar option, this mod does it automatically. Even if it is a fairly short interval, every second counts, right?

                              <span>Respawn Entertainment rolled out an update that addresses matchmaking in Apex Legends Ranked, fixes an issues with badges, and more. 


On April 3, an Apex Legends update went awry, as players lost Heirlooms and progression. Respawn Entertainment sprung into action fast and released a hot fix before the end of that day, resolving everything beside the incorrect badges displaying in Ranked. So, the devs came back and delivered another update on April 8. Previously earned badges will now display the correct rank, and the patch also included a few surprises.

The devs reworked Ranked matchmaking so parties now have a limit of a three-rank tier difference between players. For example, a Diamond player won&#x27;t be able to squad with someone in Bronze, and vice versa. This should prevent high-leveled competitors from trying to manipulate the system to get easier matches. 


The update also fixed a connection error called labeled &quot;Code:Cloud&quot; when a player tried to reconnect after a crash. Additionally, community members can now correctly see previews of gifts when receiving them. Finally, the update made various minor fixes for localization, items, and cosmetics to iron out any lingering impact from the previous scare, and Switch users should have a more stable experience when trying to play Apex Legends.  


Players no longer have to worry about losing their progression when logging in, and this update should make Ranked feel like a more balanced experience. Between the recent slip-up, and the worrying hack that happened during the Apex Legends Global Series tournament at the end of March, hopefully the battle royale title can go at least a few weeks without scaring community members.

                              <span>The Orbital Laser is a strong Stratagem to use in Helldivers 2. It’s really enticing because, unlike many other call-downs that oftentimes lead to collateral team damage, it’s precise, tracking, and easy to get away from to prevent dying. 


If you want to get your hands on the Orbital Laser and how to use it, here’s what you need to know.


How to get the Orbital Laser in Helldivers 2


The Orbital Laser is unlocked at level 15 and requires 10,000 Req Slips to purchase. It’s located under the Orbital Cannons section in the Stratagem menu. The stats on it are as follows:



Call-in time: 1 second


Uses: 3


Cooldown Time: 300 seconds

Among many of its kind stood Ratchet &amp; Clank, a game that started a franchise that continues to this day. For the curious, here are all the Ratchet &amp; Clank games in release order.


I&#x27;m not saying you should play every Ratchet &amp; Clank game, in order or otherwise. But you should at least look into the franchise if you enjoy platforming, shooting, and general space-faring hijinks. You&#x27;ll get all those things, plus several games in which the titles are clear innuendos so dorks like me can giggle every time we recommend them.

Thing is, though, that the base game is just the start, and there&#x27;s a wealth of DLC to choose from, too.


To be a tad more specific, Ark: Survival Evolved has two tiers of DLC to choose from: the map DLCs are free, while the actual expansion packs are feature-rich and content-heavy in most ways that matter. As comparing maps with actual expansion packs is fairly challenging in most senses, that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re interested in. Instead, below you&#x27;ll find a more in-depth summary of the paid expansion packs&#x27; respective feature sets and value propositions, with a dedicated map shortlist featured at the end.

How do you join a division in Type Soul?


To join a division in Roblox&#x27;s Type Soul, speak to a captain near the headquarters. You&#x27;ll choose between 13 groups, but Division 1 seems to be the only inaccessible rank. More specifically, when asking to join this ensemble, the captain will immediately refuse your proposal.

How to properly setup the D.O.T.S. projector


In order to use the D.O.T.S. projector in Phasmophobia to properly identify evidence via tracking a ghost&#x27;s movement, you need to set up the projector on the wall or floor. In this regard, it&#x27;s a bit like the motion sensor. Once you have the D.O.T.S. Projector in your hands, use the &#x27;F&#x27; key to place down the projector.

                              <span>Act 2 of Baldur’s Gate 3 has you pass through an area called the Shadow-Cursed Lands where the darkness will eat you (or something) unless you have a source of light, such as a simple torch. Get too close to the Moonrise Towers, however, and there are only a couple of ways to protect yourself.


The one we’re discussing in particular, however, is the Moon Lantern. To be more specific, the broken Moon Lantern that you maybe picked up off of True Soul Nere’s corpse (or just pickpocketed).


For clarity, if you’re wondering if you can fix the Broken Moon Lantern: yes, but not for the purpose you might be hoping for. If you’re hoping for a functional Moon Lantern, then fixing it won’t get you one. Instead, you’ll get a Shadow Lantern.

Operation Swift Disassembly tasked Helldivers 2 players with preventing an impending Automaton invasion on a scale never seen before. There were several pitfalls along the way, and it looked like all hope might be lost at one point. But the Major Order&#x27;s fourth and final phase went off without a hitch, and the pesky bots finally met their match. &quot;Today, Super Earth citizens celebrated the full eradication of the Automatons,&quot; the Helldivers 2 devs confirmed. &quot;Additionally to reward their bravery, each Helldiver has been issued an extra 1 minute break.

                              <span>The Magic: The Gathering Universes Beyond Fallout set is pretty much perfect, with dozens of cards that fit nicely with both universes. 


Magic: The Gathering manages to hit the mark with most of its Universes Beyond sets, but the Fallout set is a cut above the rest. It contains not just main characters you could recognize even if you haven&#x27;t played the games but niche themes and side quests too that are the perfect nod to long-time fans. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve put together this list showcasing what I think are the ten cards that fit the Fallout universe best.

As with any game that uses gacha mechanics, Project Mugen has an initial set of characters at launch that will be built upon over time. This means you can try to collect them all, master just a few, or chase only the most powerful characters by pulling from their banners until you end up getting them. However, it&#x27;s important to know how many there are and who they all are so you can ensure you&#x27;ve got the best, or just all of them, while you play.

The earliest iterations of Magic weren&#x27;t the sweeping boon you know today, and cards look drastically different. 


Magic: the Gathering is one of the longest-running TCGs out there that&#x27;s still getting a, quite frankly, obscene, number of expansions every year. The game is more relevant than ever, with hundreds of content creators building their careers around it and millions of fans playing the game with each other in person, online, via the mobile app, or in their local game stores each week. But without the in-depth research I&#x27;ve done, there&#x27;s no way I could have told you when it first came out.

I&#x27;m talking about technical issues. For the sake of democracy, some likely want to know how to fix the Helldivers 2 crashing on extraction errors.


I&#x27;ve looked around, and sadly there&#x27;s no guaranteed way to fix the errors causing the crashing seen by Helldivers 2 players during extraction. There are steps you can take, however, but those on PC may find more luck than their console counterparts.

                              <span>Diving into Warzone&#x27;s Rebirth Island today immediately caused a stir of confusion for me, as the skies began to dim throughout the match. At first, I believed it to be a new Call of Duty bug or something wrong with my file until I made an embarrassing conclusion: Oh, right, it&#x27;s the solar eclipse today.


Even though it took me a while to put two and two together, it was pleasing to see the skies changing hues — well, at least for the moment after I got shot at for looking at the pretty colors. If you want a front-row seat for this event, go to Rebirth Island in Warzone and wait for the solar eclipse. It won&#x27;t happen immediately, so survive as long as possible until you see that stunning picturesque shot.

Warzone&#x27;s Rebirth Island solar eclipse update doesn&#x27;t do much gameplay-wise. There are no unique objectives to complete, nor is there a mission to take down the Fire Lord for those Avatar: The Last Airbender fans out there. The update is merely for appearance purposes, but it could be used to your advantage. Given that the sky goes dark, it&#x27;s a perfect time to unleash a sneak attack while the solar eclipse triggers. 


Some players mentioned that there were no Contracts or Loot Caches during this Season 3 event. However, this particular feature seems to have been patched, and I have even confirmed that myself. 


While it is fascinating to gaze at Warzone&#x27;s solar eclipse update, remember that the match is still ongoing. Just don&#x27;t make the same mistakes as I did, and try to step away from the high-active player zones. Unfortunately, the event will likely conclude today, so capture its beauty before it&#x27;s over.

Whether you’re scrolling through social media, looking for a quick watch, or strolling down the street, there she is. Perhaps it&#x27;s no surprise then that she&#x27;s also in demand on Infinite Craft. 


There’s even a community of Swifties on Discord and Reddit on a mission to find every single song the pop powerhouse has released, and they’re doing incredibly well. They’ve dozens of her songs, some of them still puzzling (how on earth do you get “with spaces” on Infinite Craft?), but regardless, the effort is astonishing. 


So yes, technically, it’s possible to get most of, if not all, of Taylor Swift&#x27;s discography in Infinite Craft, but some are definitely easier to manage than others. With that said, I&#x27;ve go…</span>

                              <span>CODA&#x27;s war against online piracy has received renewed backing from the Hollywood studios and Netflix. Since their partnership began in 2005, Japan-based CODA and the MPA have collaborated on thousands of cases. An agreement governing their work together just celebrated its 10th anniversary and, in a ceremony last week, a two-year extension was officially acknowledged. With piracy surging, the renewal comes at just the right time.

San Diego Studio returns for a third season of baseball action on Nintendo Switch and it&#x27;s another fairly solid job all round for 2024, giving fans yet another feature-complete port that manages to get the most important stuff right during its deep and addictive matches.
Indeed, whilst MLB The Show 24 has seen plenty of technical issues at launch — which we&#x27;ll get into — and there&#x27;s not much new or exciting here over what you&#x27;ll find in the previous two outings, there&#x27;s no denying that this is probably about as good as we can realistically expect these sorts of enormous sports games to run on Switch at this point. It works, but you can almost hear the seams popping.

                              <span>Bloomin&#x27; lovely.
When cosy and wholesome games first stepped onto the scene, they were counter-culture — created in response and in resistance to an industry that churned out violence, conflict, and a particular type of masculinity that wasn&#x27;t keen on things like emotions or intimacy. Some people were tired of this monolithic and exclusionary idea of what a game &#x27;should&#x27; be — and so, as a direct contrast to all of that, the cosy game movement was created, prioritising stories that minimised conflict, and focused instead on growth and creation. That&#x27;s part of the reason why so many cosy games are about farming and relationships, because the themes of cultivation and creation are almost the exact opposite of violence and conflict.
But these days, cosy games have become a dominant part of gaming culture, and the conflict-free alternatives they once offered as a respite from the status quo are now a lucrative part of the status quo. This is what happens when counter-culture becomes culture: it forgets its roots and its purpose, and instead becomes about aping what&#x27;s already popular. In the process, many cosy games fail to understand that a player&#x27;s desire for softness and kindness does not mean that they want a completely toothless game. Challenge is not conflict. Challenge is fun.

Cast your minds back to February of this year and you might remember that Nintendo updated its Japanese website URL from &#x27;nintendo.co.jp&#x27; to &#x27;nintendo.com/jp&#x27;. Well, the Big N is continuing this trend with its European domains and has announced that the URLs for each website will be updated on 9th April 2024.
The update essentially aligns each domain into the same format, ensuring that each one starts with &#x27;nintendo.com&#x27; before requiring users to input the specific regional abbreviations afterwards. So what does this look like in practice? Well, Nintendo UK has the answer over on X:

                              <span>Blow the whistle.
It&#x27;s time to get your latest look at the UK&#x27;s boxed gaming charts, which this week (surprise, surprise) sees EA Sports FC 24 and Hogwarts Legacy at the number one and two spots. Again.
Weirdly, Elden Ring has dodge rolled its way back into proceedings this time and finds itself at third, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has once again sped into the top five despite approaching its seventh year on the market. Seriously, who doesn&#x27;t own this game by now?

The Super Mario Bros. Movie held its world premiere back on 1st April 2023 before receiving a wider release on 5th April, which means it&#x27;s now over one year old. Crikey... We still remember sitting at our desks and pouring over the trailers to see what kind of easter eggs we could spot in the run up to its release. How has it been a year already?
Regardless, the movie&#x27;s starring man Chris Pratt has taken to Instagram to commemorate the anniversary, expressing his gratitude for landing such an iconic role while slipping in what could very well be the quinessential &#x27;dad joke&#x27;:

                              <span>Last summer, we sat down with Sonic Team Creative Officer Takashi Iizuka to discuss his multi-decade career at Sega. We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.
Notably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast.

                              <span>Fallout, Amazon Prime’s TV adaptation of Bethesda’s popular RPG, is set to premiere this week on April 11. However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. 
Variety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout&#x27;s second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list
Season 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout&#x27;s production to California for Season 2.


Fallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads

Available to download right now on Steam, Nottolot, Doronko Wanko, and Boomeroad are 3D platformers released on March 26, and all three were developed by Bandai Namco, as pointed out by Dominic Tarason on X (formerly Twitter). 
In Nottolot, a free-play robot hacking action game, players control Rolly, who uses a hacking ability to control four enemies and escape from a robot production factory. There are 52 reviews for it on Steam so far, giving the game a &quot;Very Positive&quot; rating.


Boomeroad is described as an exhilarating action-adventure game in which players slide along boomerang rails they create. &quot;The game is set in an ancient ruin floating…</span>

                              <span>It’s odd to think back on a time before Baldur’s Gate 3 - and even stranger to think that the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG was actually kicking around for a long while before its 1.0 release blew up awards shows, social media feeds and fan-fiction hubs last summer. Putting the game out into early access at the end of 2020 - multiple years before it was ready for a full release - worked out very well for Larian though, so it’s maybe no surprise that they plan to do exactly the same with whatever comes next.

Sat across the table from a mysterious opponent clad in a deeply unnerving toothy mask, you pick up a shotgun loaded with shells. Then, you decide whether to point the gun at your opponent or yourself, and pull the trigger. Some of the shells are live, and others are blanks. Guess correctly, and you get to go again.

                              <span>Ubisoft might be taking this whole stealth thing a bit far when it comes to their remake of the original Splinter Cell. News of Sam Fisher’s return first snuck out at the end of 2021, with little more spotlight than a brief blog post to confirm that, yep, it’s a thing. After over two years of near-silence, it now looks like it might finally be time for Sam to emerge out of the shadows.

                              <span>Deep Rock Galactic&#x27;s Season 5 update - which launches in June 2024 - will allow you to reactivate and replay old seasons of Ghost Ship&#x27;s celebrated dwarven asteroid mining sim. Here&#x27;s how that works, direct from the bellowing bearded faces of the developers themselves. By which I mean, a new Steam blog. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to get a good dwarven bellow going when you&#x27;re talking about cosmetic unlock progression, but by all means reorganise this article into some kind of drinking song. Keep it clean, though - there may be elves reading.

                              <span>The deck-fixing roguelikelike poker of Balatro is chuffing excellent, no doubt, but my main criticism has been that the higher difficulty modes are just a bit boring. Having beat them myself, I didn&#x27;t find them a fun or interesting challenge as much as an annoying one that required too much to go right. I&#x27;m glad to hear that they&#x27;re being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked. Other changes include improved (hopefully) Steam Deck performance, balance tweaks, and better Joker-related Tags.

                              <span>When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was &quot;Elder Scrolls with friends,&quot; creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn&#x27;t until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch &quot;we were walking this weird line between &#x27;online game&#x27; and &#x27;Elder Scrolls game&#x27;,&quot; Lambert says. &quot;We didn&#x27;t do either of them particularly well.&quot;
Ten years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion&#x27;s West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn&#x27;t been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating &quot;a lot of feedback&quot;, as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game&#x27;s tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn&#x27;t until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. &quot;We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose &#x27;Elder Scrolls&#x27;. As soon as we hit that core pillar of &#x27;It&#x27;s Elder Scrolls first, online second,&#x27; then it really just helped inform everything we&#x27;ve done since.&quot; Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO&#x27;s development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.

But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It&#x27;s quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.

                              <span>I know some of you will quibble with the headline, so let me confirm straight away that, yes, technically Aquarist is not a game simulating being an aquarium. An aquarist is someone who builds and manages aquariums, which is your principle task in the capital A Aquarist game. It recently left early access, which is sort of unbelievable because it&#x27;s very janky in the most adorable way. You can tell it was made by someone who bloody loves aquariums, but taken at face value the career mode tells a strange tale indeed. For example, you have a very unsettling father.

                              <span>According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, &quot;overambitious&quot; expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.
The carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO&#x27;s Swen Vincke&#x27;s mind when he accepted Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&#x27;s Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.

                              <span>A couple of months ago, we learned that Raven Software lead designer Michael Gummelt had worked on a live service Call Of Duty zombies game before it got cancelled. Details were practically non-existent at the time, but YouTuber Glitching Queen recently interviewed Gummelt about what the game could&#x27;ve become. Fun surprises: It would&#x27;ve been a free-to-play live service game featuring coliseum battles. Unsurprises: microtransactions, seasons, general background shenanigans between Treyarch and Raven.

Before we get cracking, let&#x27;s see how things panned out last time. We checked out Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters on the SNES, pitting North America and Europe against Japan in a dual for the ages.

Square Enix is currently undergoing a large-scale organisational &quot;overhaul&quot; and it seems Dragon Quest has been impacted.
According to a new report from Bloomberg, Dragon Quest&#x27;s &quot;top producer&quot; Yu Miyake, who is now 56 years of age (and has contributed to &quot;numerous&quot; Dragon Quest titles over the years), will be &quot;stepping down from the role&quot; following delays of the new entry.

Xbox&#x27;s backyard multiplayer survival and crafting game Grounded arrives on the Switch later this month and it&#x27;s got us wondering how many users within the community here on Nintendo Life will be picking it up.
This Obsidian-developed title is already available on Xbox Game Pass, and when it launches for Switch on 16th April it will come with the final major update for the game which includes New Game+, new ant types, new mutations, weapon variants, and much more.

                              <span>Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!
Originally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.
Step into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.
Embark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). 
Can you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah&#x27;s wrath obliterate the moon?
Our modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.
To play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.

                              <span>High-quality pirated copies of &#x27;Dune: Part Two&#x27; have leaked on pirate sites over the past few hours, beating the movie&#x27;s official digital debut. The release is labeled &#x27;WEB-DL&#x27; which indicates that the file was downloaded from an online source, but which one is currently unknown. Early copies include a tribute to the busted release group EVO, which leaked the first Dune film back in 2021.

It is also a vocal opponent of the &#x27;Piracy Shield&#x27; blocking system and the law that supports it. Following the well-publicized blocking of Cloudflare,  ASSOProvider filed an official information request to obtain data relating to the program thus far. In lieu of a suitable response, AGCOM has now fined ASSOProvider for failing to provide information that just recently it informed a court it already holds.

Remember how a special task force dubbed &#x27;Team 0%&#x27; managed to clear every level in Super Mario Maker before Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U online shutdown? Well, there was also one &quot;illegitimate upload&quot; titled &#x27;Trimming the Herbs&#x27; which the community was determined to overcome.
Now, with just days remaining, this level has officially been cleared. As highlighted on the &#x27;Games&#x27; subreddit, the community persisted and this level was &quot;conquered&quot;. It was completed by &#x27;sanyx91smm2&#x27; and you can see the flawlessly executed 25-second run in the video below:

                              <span>Addressing Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;random&quot; approach to accessibility.
We can all agree that Nintendo isn&#x27;t exactly a games industry forerunner in terms of accessibility. The lack of being able to quickly and easily remap buttons in many Nintendo first-party games is just a start, but there are often mechanics that require multiple button prompts, or simple commands that require you to press different buttons per game.
It&#x27;s not an across-the-board problem, but we know Nintendo can — and should — do better. Both Sony and Microsoft have their own accessibility controllers: the PS Access Controller and the Xbox Adaptive Controller. They&#x27;re pricey, but that&#x27;s still more than Nintendo can say.

It&#x27;s the weekend folks, which means it&#x27;s time to find out which games we&#x27;ll be sinking a few hours into. Before that, however, let&#x27;s check out a recap of what&#x27;s been going down this week.
First up, we found out that the Switch might have an even bigger task ahead of it if we want it to become the best-selling console of all time. Weird... Elsewhere, the Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo officially revealed a rather fetching Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom range, and we also caught wind of an intriguing patent from Nintendo to ease those &#x27;troublesome&#x27; Switch dock wires.

The massive family tree of Samoan wrestlers dates back decades and includes members such as current undisputed champion Roman Reigns, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Yokozuna, Rikishi, and so many others. In a business filled with famous families, the Bloodline is likely the biggest family dynasty in pro wrestling history. 
That got me thinking of similar family trees across all of video game fiction and if any of them could stand toe-to-toe against the Bloodline. I’ve gathered up a few worthy clans, and while we’ll never see them square off against Roman’s fam for dominance, we can at least hypothesize who w…</span>

                              <span>It’d be quaint to suggest that Baldur’s Gate 3 was just another big-ass game.

                              <span>After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora&#x27;s Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Publisher Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment has revealed that a new Star Wars Outlaws story trailer will be released next week. We&#x27;ll be seeing more of protagonist Kay Vess and her trusty (and adorably cute) companion Nix on Tuesday, April 9, at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET. 
As for what to expect, Ubisoft hasn&#x27;t shared anything in that regard. It simply says the story trailer is arriving next week and that it will be published on YouTube. 
Watch the World Premiere of the Star Wars Outlaws Story Trailer. Join us at 9AM PST / 6PM CET.
April 5, 2024
This story trailer is our next taste of Star Wars Outlaws, an open-world adventure set between Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It was announced during an Xbox Games Showcase last June and further showcased with gameplay at a Ubisoft Forward the same month. You can read more about the game in our preview of it here, and you can read this exclusive interview with the game&#x27;s narrative director about what to expect. 
Star Wars Outlaws is due out sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

                              <span>Front Mission 2: Remake is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC later this month. More specifically, the previously Switch-exclusive remake will hit these new platforms on April 30. 
Released back in October on Switch, Front Mission 2: Remake is the first time Western players have been able to play through this tactics/strategy RPG since the game&#x27;s original Japan-only release in 1997. It&#x27;s set 12 years after Front Mission 1st: Remake, which hit Switch in November 2022 and other platforms in June of last year, and puts players in control of Ash, an O.C.U soldier trying to escape the overrun nation of Alordesh. However, in this escape, Ash learns of a much broader conspiracy. 
Check out the Front Mission 2: Remake release date trailer for yourself below: 


Like the Switch version, Front Mission 2: Remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC features improved loading times compared to the original, free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new customization options, and extra language support. 
Starting April 15, PC players can check out a free demo of Front Mission 2: Remake on Steam. Developer and publisher Forever Entertainment says saved game data from the demo will carry over to the full game upon its release later this month. 
Front Mission 2: Remake hit Switch back in October; it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on April 30.

Codenamed Project Apollo, this Nolanverse Batman game would have featured the likeness of Christian Bale&#x27;s Dark Knight, the &quot;Tumbler&quot; Batmobile, plenty of gadgets, and a unique spin on the Caped Crusader&#x27;s detective work.

                              <span>Relic Entertainment, the freshly-independent developers of Company of Heroes, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Age of Empires IV, have confirmed a number of job losses. The layoffs come just a week after the studio announced their sale from former owners Sega, returning them to independence after two decades.

                              <span>I think we might be nearing the point where there are Too Many Retro Zeldalikes, and specifically Too Many Link’s Awakealikes – recent candidates include Isles Of Sea And Sky and Blossom Tales - but I’m definitely willing to go adventuring with Castaway, in which you are a spaceman called Martin who has crashlanded on an island’s worth of gently rounded, 8-bit scenery. 
Martin’s goal is to rescue his pet dog, which doesn’t sound like it’ll take too long – the “concise and delightful” story mode boasts just three bosses. But lurking behind that all-too-innocent story mode there is a Biblical terror in the shape of a 50-floor tower, made up of increasingly challenging trials. Link’s Awakening with a sort of Bloody Palace component? Yeah, I’ll take that.

                              <span>Fulqrum Publishing have just released a story trailer for New Arc Line, a new steampunk fantasy RPG in which dragons rub shoulders with zeppelins, and dwarves are as abundant as air pollution. I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before and am quite interested, partly because the game sports some wonderfully mangled and colourful dystopian maps, and partly because it&#x27;s a story of immigrants trying to find their way to an inevitably deceptive &quot;shining city of progress&quot;, rather than the typical Chosen One fare.
Your family specifically are afflicted by a fatal disease. Your initial and perhaps overall goal in New Arc Line is to find a cure, of course, but who knows, along the way you might have to &quot;get your hands dirty&quot;, &quot;rise from the bottom&quot; and become some sort of absolute bastard. Take us away, trailer!

                              <span>In the dingy portside taverns that pop up, seemingly unbidden, like roiling blisters along the coastal towns of the Old World, the name Count Noctilus is spoken only in hushed whispers by those blasted enough on grog to forget themselves. They are sure to be swiftly rebuked by their fellows for playing dice with fate, those still of sound mind rightly afeared that the name may echo through the brine and tickle the ears of the dread captain himself. On the seas he calls kingdom, Noctilus is without equal, without mercy, and utterly without hesitation. For what has a dead man left to fear?
He has but one fatal flaw; he is deathly afraid of ever leaving his comfortable ship to touch ‘pon the verdant grass of land. I intend to honour this. Do you hear me, lubbers? I will show my strategy game mastery by conquering Total War: Warhammer 3’s world, and I will never touch grass.

                              <span>Ever since Lords Of The Realm, I&#x27;ve had a soft spot for feudalism sims. Although faux-medieval games are common, there aren&#x27;t all that many about regular people and regular concerns. Even LotR was increasingly about battles and armies as it went on, rather than the unique management parts.
But in Under The Yoke, you&#x27;re just a serf. You want to make something of yourself, but it&#x27;s about a regular person managing his life, not some unlikely &quot;adventurer&quot;, whatever that means. So you&#x27;ll mostly be toiling, and foraging, and genuinely having way more actual skills than us superior modern folk. And despite some UI issues and rough edges, it&#x27;s weirdly compelling.

                              <span>Friends! Jaegers! Evas! Lend me your radar dishes or cybernetic ear trumpets. Developers Storm Trident and publishers Forever Entertainment have popped up a Steam demo for their Front Mission 2 remake. Tucked within its coils there are two whole levels, Rimian Base and Batari Forest, together with a Garage where you can customise your Wanzer and access to the in-game Network menu.


&quot;Who are you calling a Wanzer?&quot; you bellow. Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders.

                              <span>For a handheld PC, the Steam Deck benefits an awful lot from having a mouse and keyboard plugged into it, and nothing enables this marriage of portable and peripheral like one of the best Steam Deck docks. And it’s not just USB connectivity that gets a boost – external displays, rock-solid Ethernet connections for game downloads, and power delivery all make dock usage a preferable alternative to simply hooking up Bluetooth accessories. Along with a microSD card (and possibly a better case), these stand/hub combos are definitely among the tools that any regular Steam Deck wielder should have.

                              <span>As a valued RPS supporter, you’re likely aware that you possess legal ownership of the fleeting thoughts I have right before falling asleep at night. It’s actually in the T&amp;C, right under the bit about Horace’s claim on your organs. Good news: such interruptions are plentiful, and so too will be content. Here&#x27;s my latest:
Am I doomed, I asked myself, to live in wishful longing for the myriad gaming experiences I could have had if I didn’t tend to get obsessed with a few specific games, both digital and tabletop, that take up all my leisure time? 
Obviously I didn’t phrase it like that. It was more like ‘whawhaohhnoo’.

                              <span>Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That&#x27;s a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I&#x27;ve watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I&#x27;ve heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it&#x27;s enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.
I spent a portion of the game&#x27;s tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you&#x27;re whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city&#x27;s outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year&#x27;s Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there&#x27;s something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that&#x27;s definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.

                              <span>As World Of Warcraft Classic - an MMORPG that is, confusingly, a new version of the old version of World Of Warcraft - enters phase 3 of its Season Of Discovery, PCGamer has an interview with some of the devs where they talk about the decision to not run Player Test Realms - servers where they roll out the new content to smaller numbers of players to road test it. This means that when they launch new stuff for Seasons Of Discovery it&#x27;ll probably break more often, but it means players get to discover brand new things together. Which is great! And the developers think it&#x27;s good too.

                              <span>The long-serving top producer of legendary RPG series Dragon Quest has stepped down from the role, according to sources that spoke to RPS Maw tribute site Bloomberg. Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.
The change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)

                              <span>A big &#x27;ol patch is coming to the System Shock remake next Thursday, headlined by &quot;[reworking] the entire final fight with new mechanics and a unique flow&quot; and adding a female character option for our hacker. Update 1.2 will also tweak and fix and fiddle with heaps of other things. Our System Shock review called it &quot;a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design&quot; when it launched last year, though I would say System Shock&#x27;s final battle is one of the most dated parts, so I&#x27;m curious to see the new form.

So, if you don’t fancy shelling out the full £19.10 for all three factions, you can grab new bits for either Nurgle, the Empire, or the Dwarfs for £7.49. If you do buy just one to start off with - say, to get a feel for the quality of Thrones of Decay as a package - you’ll get a 15% discount on the remaining two packs in the future.

It&#x27;s a turn-based RPG, it&#x27;s a roguelike with permadeath, it&#x27;s got XCOM-style base-building, its got card-based combat; it is extremely your sort of thing, if you&#x27;re the exact statistical average of Rock Paper Shotgun readers.

                              <span>Vlambeer, developers of Nuclear Throne, Luftrausers and Super Crate Box, among others, called it quits back in 2020, so that co-founders Jan Willem Nijman and Rami Ismail could work separately on other projects.

Now Vlambeer is returning. Nijman announced today that he is now the sole owner of Vlambeer, and he&#x27;s going to release new games under the name while continuing to support their older releases.

                              <span>Update: Roblox Studios have responded to Eurogamer&#x27;s report, in particular addressing the quote that they &quot;hired some teenagers&quot; to clarify that they do not hire minors. You can find Roblox Studios&#x27; full response over on Eurogamer.
Original story
Roblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.

&quot;I don&#x27;t know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?&quot; said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. &quot;Like, you can say, &#x27;Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,&#x27; right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.

                              <span>As part of a widespread torrent tracker crackdown in Denmark, the National Unit for Special Crime investigated and prosecuted more than two dozen suspects. The most recent defendant, a 48-year-old man from East Jutland, pleaded guilty to his involvement in the Asgaard tracker and was handed a conditional prison sentence. According to local anti-piracy group Rights Alliance, the punishment should have been much tougher.

                              <span>In September 2023, Swedish anti-piracy group Rights Alliance was looking forward to the upcoming trial of a man suspected of being behind a pirate IPTV service. He registered the site&#x27;s domain and in 2020 received almost $190,000 in cryptocurrency from sales. The case was backed by IP address evidence and a financial investigation, but things didn&#x27;t go exactly to plan. A court of appeal decision handed down Thursday couldn&#x27;t alleviate the disappointment.

                              <span>On this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew discusses our time playing the public demo of Stellar Blade, the character action game formerly known as Project Eve. We drill into Pepper Grinder, the latest title from Devolver Digital, and then discuss a rad town-building sandbox called Summerhouse. After highlighting Stunt Paradise, a small game that fans of the Trials series might enjoy, we steer the conversation towards Marcus&#x27; Open Roads review and how the title compares to Gone Home and Tacoma.

                              <span>Publisher Microids and newcomer developer Savage Level have revealed Flint: Treasure of Oblivion, a turn-based tactical RPG set in a world of piracy. This swashbuckling debut from Savage Level is due out in Q4 of this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and if today&#x27;s debut trailer is any indication, it looks like a game worth keeping a spyglass on. 
Savage Level describes Flint as a double-A game that takes inspiration from one of piracy&#x27;s most famed fictional stories: Treasure Island.

                              <span>Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung Tae has announced that developer ShiftUp&#x27;s upcoming action game, Stellar Blade, will get a New Game+ mode sometime after launch. Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. 
This news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won&#x27;t be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company&#x27;s IP. 


&quot;We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,&quot; Tae told Ruliweb. &quot;The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company&#x27;s IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.&quot; 
Given that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp&#x27;s Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it&#x27;s possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. 
Stellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you&#x27;re curious about how the game plays.

Dubbed v0.2.0.6, the Steam version of this update for PC players is already live; the Xbox version will be released when it&#x27;s ready, according to Pocketpair. 
As for what to expect, today&#x27;s update is one of Palworld&#x27;s biggest. But chief among the additions is the game&#x27;s first raid boss, a heavily anticipated aspect of the survival game&#x27;s endgame. Let&#x27;s break it all down:

Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.
The clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. As for when exactly to expect these shirts to hit the states, though, that remains unknown. 
The Tears of the Kingdom line consists of six shirts, and you can check each out in the gallery below: 

On the Japanese website for Uniqlo, each of these shirts is listed for 1,500 Yen, which converts to less than $10 a shirt. However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states.

                              <span>A fresh new batch of Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II previews have dropped today, which is how we learned Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade director-writer Anteem Antoniades is no longer at the studio. It&#x27;s also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. 
Speaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game&#x27;s more cinematic nature. However, if you&#x27;re after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. 


Regardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game&#x27;s more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because &quot;the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.&quot; Be sure to read Polygon&#x27;s full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

                              <span>Ninja Theory co-founder and Hellblade: Senua&#x27;s Sacrifice writer and director Anteem Antoniades has left the company. This news comes from a new Polygon preview of Ninja Theory&#x27;s upcoming release, Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II, which hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. 
Polygon noticed during a hands-on preview of Hellblade II at Ninja Theory&#x27;s Cambridge, U.K.-based studio that there was no trace of Antoniades. A spokesperson for Xbox confirmed later that Antoniades was no longer working at Ninja Theory.


&quot;On my visit, there was no sign or mention of Ninja Theory&#x27;s flamboyant founder and Hellblade writer-director Tameem Antoniades,&quot; Polygon writes in its Hellblade II preview. &quot;An Xbox spokesperson later confirmed to Polygon that he is no longer with the studio. Antoniades was involved in Hellblade 2 in the early stages, but the game now has a trio of creative leads: environment art director Dan Attwell, visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill, and audio director David Garcia.&quot; 
Beyond the Hellblade series, Antoniades also worked on Ninja Theory&#x27;s Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry. 
Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21.

For the English Premier League, a £43m deal with Match TV was suspended but Russians wasted no time exploring other options. Pirate IPTV services, web-based streaming portals, and streams on betting apps filled the void. HD presentations on the social networking site VK also hit the spot, complete with homegrown commentary teams and custom graphics.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not much of a reality TV watcher. Genuinely, I&#x27;ve been humiliated on this count in RPS morning meetings, with certain &quot;colleagues&quot; whose names rhyme with &quot;Malice Knell&quot; making references I don&#x27;t understand and laughing at my expression of hurt and confusion. My grasp of reality TV basically ends with the finale of the very first season of Big Brother, feat. Nasty Nick. But you could argue that you don&#x27;t need to watch reality TV to understand and enjoy reality TV, because the basic reality TV thrill of forming weird parasocial attachments to people who are role-playing as themselves is now the golden rule of digital society generally.


&quot;&#x27;Reality&#x27; stuff is huge now, and it&#x27;s not just reality TV,&quot; says Nicole He, designer of The Crush House - an enticing, absurdist and engrossingly unpleasant new sim from Reigns and Card Shark developers Nerial. &quot;It&#x27;s any kind of celebrity or influencer or streamer or something like that - there are so many parasocial relationships in that way, and I think that really started with reality TV, and then [continued] in the era of social media. It&#x27;s one of those topics that we don&#x27;t talk about in an explicit way, necessarily, but it&#x27;s something that you hopefully think about as you&#x27;re playing the game.&quot;

                              <span>You could say that the best Steam Deck case is the one you get for free, and to be sure, I have no qualms with Valve’s bundled carrier. Especially not the one you get with the 1TB Steam Deck OLED, which adds a neat mini-case in the form of a removable liner. Still! As you’ll see here, you do have a choice of worthwhile upgrade options, ranging from conventional hard cases with extra accessory storage to clever protective sleeves that combine impact resistance with improved handheld grip. The best way to avoid Steam Deck damage is to not drop it in the first place, as Sun Tzu probably said.

                              <span>This week you could get two horror games for free! Rental and Content Warning both launched for nada (albeit for a couple of days only in the case of the latter). Nate and I have both done work for free in the hope someone would retrospectively pay for it, so on this episode of the Electronic Wireless Show podcast Is it worth it? Is this how the internet is going to work from now on? Plus, what are some of our favourite free games? There are a bunch.
We also talk about the science that suggests people process visual information at wildly different speeds (I know I shouldn&#x27;t have said that some people just &#x27;see more fasterer&#x27; or whatever reductive thing I said, please don&#x27;t email me), Nate teaches me about some weird cryptids, and we recommend some sweet non-video game stuff, as per usual.

                              <span>&#x27;The Wild Bastards&#x27; is about the best name I&#x27;ve heard for a gang of alien outlaws in a space-western, good enough that let&#x27;s skip past the fact that the game was announced last year and we&#x27;ve only just noticed. Wild Bastards is the follow-up to Void Bastards, 2019&#x27;s roguelikelike first-person shooter about a prisoner in a corporate nightmare forced to raid derelict spaceships on a wild goose chase. This time, it&#x27;s leaning into crime, jaunting across the galaxy to resurrect a game of legendary outlaws, the Wild Bastards. Allow me to repeat that name: the Wild Bastards. Alright, now come watch the gameplay trailer.

                              <span>A terrible confession: I almost fell asleep during the presentation for Motion Twin&#x27;s Windblown. This wasn&#x27;t really Motion Twin&#x27;s fault. It was the afternoon of day four at GDC, my adrenaline reserves were spent, and there I was, in a warm, shuttered hotel room, with two men gently bombarding me with French-accented details of synergies, stackable trinkets and i-frames (I&#x27;m aware that the scenario I&#x27;ve just described is probably somebody&#x27;s kink - let&#x27;s move swiftly on).


Windblown itself is an airy, bright fusillade of Saturday morning cartoon vibes, a series of breakneck arena fights waged on procedurally generated island chains floating against a whirlpool sky. It&#x27;s all shaping up very nicely, and if I&#x27;d been playing the demo, I&#x27;m sure it would have woken me up better than any emergency deluge of instant coffee. But watching somebody else tear through this stratospheric world simply overloaded my depleted senses, and I came perilously close to nodding off.

                              <span>Tropes aren&#x27;t actually bad, right? Like, I&#x27;m not actually mad that a lot of games use &#x27;the world is ending and you have to save it&#x27; as an inciting incident. When people complain about something being &#x27;tropey&#x27; I think often what they&#x27;re complaining about is that the work isn&#x27;t putting any kind of interesting spin on the tropes. Great God Grove is a weirdo puzzle game where you have to stop the world from ending, and the only way you can communicate is by sucking up things people say to you and then firing them back out of your news cannon. It&#x27;s coming to PC in 2024. Jolly good.

                              <span>In response to gold generation and item exploits in action rpg game Last Epoch, developer Eleventh Hour have released a statement on Steam admonishing those responsible and reaffirming their commitment to preventing further exploits on &quot;both a technical and user level.&quot;
The statement, which also mentions nefarious goings on involving the very much banned RMT (real money trading), details the recent fixes released to combat these issues, as well as the identification and banning of accounts found to have broken the game’s terms of service.

                              <span>I’m not saying that Zuzu, the star of melancholic 2D adventure Skaramazuzu, is definitely inspired by that Adventure Time bit where the deer takes off its hooves like gloves. But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. 
We got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below:

                              <span>Pocketpair have released a new Palworld update, Steam version v0.2.0.6, which introduces the monster-catching survival game&#x27;s first Raid Boss, a gloating Gothy squid-lady by the name of Bellanoir. She&#x27;ll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the &quot;extreme&quot; version of the boss. Bellanoir can&#x27;t be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.


This is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you&#x27;ll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal&#x27;s break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.

                              <span>Vampire survival game V Rising has been kicking around in early access for a couple of years now, so there’s a good chance you may have already picked it up. If you haven’t but are curious to give it a go, you might want to grab it sooner than later. Ahead of the game’s full 1.0 launch, its price tag will be permanently raised to almost twice its previous cost.

                              <span>Earlier today Tom Betts - founder of Nullpointer and former lead programmer at The Signal From Tolva developers Big Robot - emailed me about his new game The Horror At Highrook. In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.
This is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs. What fell secrets lurk behind his perfectly groomed exterior? Anyway, here’s the trailer.

                              <span>With a desktop version of the RTX 4050 looking less likely with every turn o’ the Earth, the true entry-level GPU among Nvidia’s current generation solely remains in the realm of gaming laptops. It’s also, I’ll admit, overdue some consideration on RPS. Between the lack of cheap graphics cards among the desktop RTX 40 series, the year-and-a-bit that DLSS 3 has had to grow its compatible games library, and the Steam Deck reminding everyone that portable, low-end gaming can still be pleasurable, now seems like the RTX 4050’s time to shine. Or, at the very least, gently twinkle.

                              <span>Do you remember the noughties fan warz over which game had the best terrain destruction physics? The victors of that particular forum skirmish were probably DICE&#x27;s Battlefield games, with their woozy Frostbitten cinematography and dependable multiplayer tactic of having a whole team focus fire on a single capture point, gradually reducing it to stumps of foundation. But leftier souls may have preferred Volition&#x27;s (RIP) Red Faction series, the third of which, Red Faction: Guerrilla, featured a granular demolition engine that you bash apart whole bases with a sledgehammer.
Well, Guerrilla&#x27;s lead tech designer Luke Schneider is still in the architecture-ruining business: his and Radiangames&#x27;s latest, the hopefully self-explanatory Instruments Of Destruction, leaves Steam early access on May 10th, 2024. Here&#x27;s the 1.0 trailer.

                              <span>It&#x27;s a fond hope, a fool&#x27;s hope, but perhaps 2024 will be remembered not as the year of Yet More Layoffs, but the year of Unexpected Hits. Surprise record-setters like Palworld, which I don&#x27;t especially like, Helldivers 2, which I rather enjoy, and now Content Warning, which I&#x27;m still figuring out. If you missed it, the co-op horror game released on Monday with a temporary free promotion, and racked up a 200,000-player Steam concurrency last night. Published by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator outfit Landfall, it&#x27;s sort of like Lethal Company in being about venturing into horrible places as a wibbly-wobbly defenceless explorer, but rather than gathering scrap for resale, you&#x27;re filming yourself and the monsters in a bid to publish a viral &quot;SpookTube&quot; video, with tuber celebrity translating into cash for new equipment. 
Each video is edited together automatically from your footage and accompanying voicechat, once you return from each trip to the Old World, and you can watch it all on an in-game monitor with a mocked-up chat feed and viewcount. It&#x27;s a pungent, potted commentary on the machinations of Youtube celebrity, with heady notes of &quot;cautionary tale about algorithmic content generation&quot; and &quot;cautionary tale about people endangering or hurting themselves being a dependable source of views&quot;. Urgh, I can feel an op-ed coming on. In the meantime, here&#x27;s how the developers - a team of only five - are updating Content Warning following its launch success.

It&#x27;s a cracking little game, parkouring about with the help of supernatural powers and a grappling hook, but ends right as it feels like it&#x27;s getting started. I&#x27;d certainly be up for three hours of this, so how splendid to hear that the developers are planning to make a &quot;complete&quot; and fancier experience.

Turns out there&#x27;s evidence that we might all see life at different FPS. That player might not be cheating, he might just experience Fortnite at a speed you don&#x27;t.

                              <span>The PC and console market grew by 2.6% to $93.5 billion in revenue last year, according to a new report by video games date company Newzoo (cheers, Kotaku!) That’s good, right? Growth is universally a good thing, otherwise all those nice, dead-eyed men in suits wouldn’t keep saying it was. You can’t just lie about growth, that’s a business crime. However, here’s some slightly more worrying news, depending on how much you value new ideas: Of all the game time that gamers spent gaming in quantifiable Big Year for Gaming 2023, just 20% of that time was gamed on games other than the 66 specific games mentioned in the report.

                              <span>The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO&#x27;s hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”
ZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion.

That’s according to Insider Gaming, who were told by sources that ‘The Rogue Prince of Persia’, as the game is rumoured to be named, will first release in Steam early access. It’s reckoned to have been in development for the last four years or so, and supposedly came about after a talk between Evil Empire and Ubisoft at GDC 2019.

                              <span>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the popular free-to-play Star Wars collectible turn-based strategy RPG mobile game, is coming to PC with cross-save functionality and improved performance. Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, &quot;We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.&quot; The game&#x27;s layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.
Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately &quot;there is no controller support at this time&quot;). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, &quot;The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.&quot;
Beta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: &quot;For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta.&quot; You can learn more here.</span>

While Ubisoft Forward and Summer Game Fest aren&#x27;t technically connected, they typically take place during the same time frame in LA, and this year is no different. With Summer Game Fest&#x27;s livestream set for June 7, with the invite-only media and influencer event for hands-on gameplay with upcoming games set for June 8 through June 10, it seems press, influencers, and fans will cap off the summer&#x27;s gaming streams with Ubisoft Forward. 
It’s back ✨

However, with a slew of upcoming and in-development games like Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Codename Red, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Codename Hexe, XDefiant, and The Division Heartland, there&#x27;s plenty we might see at this year&#x27;s Ubisoft Forward event. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read about the reveal of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Codename Red and Codename Hexe, and then check out the gameplay debut of Star Wars Outlaws. After that, check out our hands-on gameplay with XDefiant, and then watch the latest trailer for The Division Heartland.

                              <span>Newcomer developer Nagai Industries Inc. has revealed its debut game called inKonbini: One Store. Many Stories, and it&#x27;s a love letter to one of the best parts of Japan: convenience stores. No seriously, Japan&#x27;s convenience stores, whether it&#x27;s a local mom &#x27;n pop place, Lawson&#x27;s (best chicken), Family Mart (best desserts), or 7-Eleven (best egg salad sandos), entering one of these is a treat. 
As someone who just got back from a vacation in Japan, I&#x27;m heavily missing these stores, conveniently located everywhere throughout major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and elsewhere. Perhaps that&#x27;s why InKonbini&#x27;s reveal trailer has me so excited to play this team&#x27;s first game; but the game itself looks great, too.

                              <span>Final Fantasy XVI is nearing its one-year anniversary since its release back in June of last year on PlayStation 5. With its final set of DLC coming in The Rising Tide launching this spring, and the PC release on the horizon, developer Creative Business Unit III has brought protagonist Clive Rosfield over to its other Final Fantasy game, the critically acclaimed MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV. 
Thanks to a new crossover event between FFXIV and FFXVI, players can now make their Warrior of Light look like Clive and even ride atop his trusty dog companion, Torgal. Plus, the crossover contains a new story questline for FFXIV, orchestration rolls to collect that feature songs from FFXVI, and an adorable puppy Torgal minion.

Any conversation about great roguelites is incomplete without mentioning Dead Cells, the Castlevania-inspired game from developer Motion Twin. With its variety of biomes, massive armory of unlockable weapons, and breakneck combat, it&#x27;s cemented itself as one of the best roguelites of all time. But after seven years of support, its development team is moving onto a new project that has the potential to be just as exciting: Windblown, an isometric roguelite with bright graphics and three-player co-op.


The game was revealed with a beautifully animated announcement trailer at last year&#x27;s Game Awards ceremony, and while it showed brief snippets of gameplay, it left a lot to be desired. T…</span>

Now, Episode 4 is out for viewing on Disney Plus, and it&#x27;s clear what the team behind the series was alluding to: The 1992 Konami-developed beat &#x27;em up arcade cabinet game, X-Men. 
We won&#x27;t spoil the episode here, but in the teaser clip released yesterday, we see Jubilee and Roberto taking on Sentinel enemies in clear sidescroller beat &#x27;em up fashion, and it looks awesome. Check it out for yourself below: 


If you enjoyed this clip, catching up on X-Men &#x27;97 is easy as there are only four episodes out so far. And even if you&#x27;re not interested in this series, today&#x27;s new episode is worth watching if you&#x27;ve ever gone hands-on with Konami&#x27;s classic X-Men arcade cabinet.

                              <span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake is &quot;alive and well,&quot; according to Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch. He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. 
Last month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn&#x27;t mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. 


Now, thanks to Karch&#x27;s interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. 
&quot;It&#x27;s clear and it&#x27;s obvious that we&#x27;re working on this,&quot; Karch told the publication. &quot;It&#x27;s been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we&#x27;re dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.&quot; 
That&#x27;s all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber&#x27;s sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away.

                              <span>RPS was on holiday yesterday, which is fortuitous timing because it was April 1st and it meant we missed all the &quot;jokes&quot; (lies) the games industry likes to spread on that day each year.

Credit to Arma developer&#x27;s Bohemia Interactive, however. Their April 1st announcement was that the latest update for Arma Reforger was Tiny Wars, a game mode in which you controlled tiny toy Army Men as they waged war around a proportionally huge home. As ever, this isn&#x27;t really a joke, but it also wasn&#x27;t exactly a lie, because you can actually play Tiny Wars for real now.

                              <span>Microsoft have announced April&#x27;s new arrivals for the Game Pass subscription service, and it includes a cute game about being an alligator, a cute game about gardening, a cute game about fleeing a doomed planet in search of a new home among the stars, and also EA Sports PGA Tour, I guess.

                              <span>Former Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw is making a new fantasy game. Eternal Strands is third-person adventure pitched as a mixture of Shadow Of The Colossus and Monster Hunter with Tears Of The Kingdom&#x27;s physics powers. The trailer, which you&#x27;ll find below, certainly has giants you can clamber across and spray with goop.

It&#x27;s a free (free!) little game originally made for 2022&#x27;s 32bit jam that takes about 20 minutes to play through, wherein you play a child rabbit who has arrived at a holiday cabin with her family. You&#x27;re the first to head inside and, oop, the door locks behind you. Classic twist. A further twist is that, while Rental is entirely free to download and play, you can buy a supporter zine as DLC to kick some funds to the devs. Noice.

                              <span>In Keepsake&#x27;s co-op four-player space game Jump Ship, née Hyperspace, you can scuttle your own vessel by overcooking a pizza. There&#x27;s a cooking minigame in your ship&#x27;s canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don&#x27;t.
It&#x27;s a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn&#x27;t place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you&#x27;re busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it&#x27;ll eventually singe your ship&#x27;s health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It&#x27;s an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve&#x27;s timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.

                              <span>Like an aggressively competitive thane at a reindeer-piss guzzling contest, 2D tac-and-slash roguelite Sons Of Valhalla never lets up the pace for even a moment. Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.
Viking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.

                              <span>So, how was everyone’s long weekend? I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think I may have even sensed the fading ghost of an immeasurably whisper-thin ray of sunshine at one point. Enough! Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.
Alongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.

In this spooky co-op treat from Landfall Publishing, you play a bunch of amateur filmmakers - or tubers, as the kids possibly still insist on calling them - who must board a spaceship, travel to another planet and film anything monstrous they stumble on.

                              <span>It’s usually better when writing about games to defer to personal experience before regurgitating marketing, but in the case of bizarre and deeply intriguing 90’s FPS PO’ed, the trailer that STAR WARS: Dark Forces Remaster studio Nightdive released over the long weekend contains a quote that sums up my memories perfectly: “First game I ever owned and played on my PS1,” says quote-ee matt.baller, “In hindsight, I’m surprised I’m not more messed up.”
PO’ed, in which you play a Pissed Off space chef crash-landed on an alien world, was not the very first game I owned for my PS1, but it was certainly one of, and it left a very strong impression. Probably because the first weapon you get is a frying pan, which you then use to batter horrible chicken-leg aliens. If you’re as lost as I imagine anyone hearing of this for the first time might rightly be, here’s that trailer.

                              <span>New week, new PC games! It&#x27;s another mercifully brief four day week in the UK due to reasons of religion, so let&#x27;s roll with an appropriately snappy intro that avoids any extended digressionary preambles about, oh, I don&#x27;t know, magpies fighting outside my flat this morning. Did you know that European magpies are great mimics? Second only to the Northern Mockingbird, apparently, though many ornithologists contend that the Brown Thrasher is sorely overlooked. You certainly hear their vocal range when they squabble - I reckon somebody should train up a ChatGPT AI on their calls and no, stop it, I&#x27;m doing an anecdote!
Those new PC game releases, without any further ado about birds: Minish Cap-esque shmup Minishoot Adventures (2nd April); Cuban fantasy metroidvania Saviorless (2nd April); culinary defence game Kitchen Crisis (3rd April); Dorfromantikal world builder Planetiles (3rd April); rhythmic robo-dystopian roguelike Beat Slayer (4th April); 90s biker&#x27;s delight BMX Streets (5th April).

                              <span>MechWarrior is a video game series that has been going strong since 1989, and was even a tabletop wargame before that. Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe&#x27;s fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.
Join Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.

It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it&#x27;s made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.
It&#x27;s worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they&#x27;re limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they&#x27;re only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They&#x27;re also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere. The other fast-travel option is an expensive item called a ferrystone, whi…</span>

                              <span>Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.
In a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. 
&quot;As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,&quot; says Gearbox as part of its statement. &quot;The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.&quot;
While Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  
Embracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal.

                              <span>After teasing the reveal of its first project last week, Yellow Brick Games has unveiled the first trailer for Eternal Strands. The fantasy action-adventure title is coming in 2025. 
Eternal Strands centers on Brynn, a warrior known as a Weaver searching for secrets of the formerly mighty nation called the Enclave. The game’s system centers around using the world, namely elements and temperature, to your advantage. Brynn wields a magical cloak called the Mantle, which grants her power to manipulate the elements by channeling magic. A reactive world means she can explore by harnessing weather events such as a flash freeze to augment ice abilities and create bridges to open new paths. She could also use a heatwave to start fires that spread realistically, consuming vegetation and enemies ali…</span>

It arrives after a secret update in March that added flying terminid bugs to the game and another that nerfed bug spawn rates on harder difficulties.

The court agreed that liability isn&#x27;t automatic but it denied the ISP&#x27;s request, ruling that there are other copyright-specific factors at play.

                              <span>Harold Halibut has been in development for more than a decade. It has a fascinating and unique style set in a well-realized future where a portion of humanity has relocated to an underwater planet. It&#x27;s a bit like Interstellar, but if things had gone how they were supposed to. Ahead of the game&#x27;s release on April 16 (on Game Pass as well as other platforms), Charles Harte and I decided to take a look at an early portion of the game, discuss the developers&#x27; intentions for the narrative and gameplay, and detail how the game was made.
For a whole lot more on Harold Halibut, you can read this feature where I interviewed game director Ole Tillmann and art director Onat Hekimoglu.

Other older torrents, including a copy of the documentary &quot;Revolution OS&quot;, also remain active after two decades.

                              <span>XDefiant, the free-to-play arena-shooter - a la Apex Legends, Overwatch 2, Valorant or the multiplayer team-based game of your choice - built around classes and factions from across the Ubisoft universe games from Splinter Cell and Far Cry to Ghost Recon and Watch Dogs, has been delayed. Originally outlined for a launch before the end of March - you’ll note that we’re now in April - the upcoming FPS will apparently now decide a release date after an upcoming stress test for its servers.

                              <span>Oh MMy — a new ScummVM release!
Please welcome the first ScummVM release of the year: ScummVM 2.8.1.
ScummVM 2.8.1 is a maintenance release mainly focused on fixing bugs that were uncovered since our last stable release.
This update includes upgrades for the following engines: AGI, AGS, GRIM, SWORD2, MM (which is now enabled — yes, we really skipped it in 2.8.0 by accident), mTropolis, NANCY, SCUMM, TWINE, Ultima, and V-Cruise.
The Android, Atari and macOS ports received multiple bug fixes, mostly for improving overall stability and preventing some crashes we’ve seen under certain circumstances.
The detailed list of improvements is available here.
As always, you can find the latest release on our Downloads page.
Go grab it while it&#x27;s hot — enjoy!

CD Projekt Red are no stranger to releasing buggy games, but they&#x27;re less keen on microtransactions - at least for singleplayer games. In an interview with a Polish investor site, CDPR&#x27;s chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said that they &quot;do not see a place for microtransactions in the case of singleplayer games&quot;, but they wouldn&#x27;t rule it out for multiplayer.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we took the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for m…</span>

The four-part series features interviews with thirty of the game&#x27;s lead designers, such as director Naoki Hamaguchi, creative director Tetsuya Nomura, and producer Yoshinori Kitase, who discuss how Square brought Rebirth to life.
Each episode tackles different aspects of Rebirth. Episode 1 focuses on world-building, Episode 2 covers the story/cutscenes, Episode 3 is all about the characters and combat, and Episode 4 tackles the English voice actors. Each episode runs between 15-18 minutes. You can watch the first episode below.

                              <span>Red Candle Games made its name developing psychological horror titles such as Detention and Devotion, but its third game, Nine Sols, sees the studio veer into the action genre. First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.
Nine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. 


The 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. 
Nine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo). You can learn more about Nine Sols’ creation and the history of Red Candle Games by reading our studio profile.</span>

With over a decade of work already invested in the fan project, however, the team have now released a call for help to overcome development hurdles caused by the ongoing troubled state of the games industry.

                              <span>It’s been close to three years since Celeste and TowerFall developers Extremely OK Games revealed their next project, the similarly gorgeous-looking and sumptuous-sounding 2D exploration platformer Earthblade. While the studio didn’t give any indication of a release date at the time, we now know not to expect Earthblade until 2025 at the earliest.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has dropped its first update, addressing one of the fantasy action-RPG’s most baffling decisions - the inability to start a new game once you’ve begun your first adventure - and letting you acquire a home of your own earlier, providing a reliable place to rest and save. There are some other small tweaks too, while Capcom dare to raise the question about future DLC in the wake of the game’s controversial microtransactions.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I played a game as effortlessly cool as Underdogs. This VR mech-fighting game has you pilot a giant mechanical gorilla, pummelling robots and human-controlled mechs with arms the length of lorries in grungy, trap-filled arenas. The combat alone is chest-thumpingly good, but Underdogs couples it with a fantastically evocative cyberpunk setting, and a smartly implemented rogue-like structure.

                              <span>Windowkill is the most inventive arcade shooter I&#x27;ve played for years.
It&#x27;s twin-stick shooting in a tiny window that temporarily expands in that direction when you shoot its edges. You have to actively manage and maintain the play space itself for that to even be an option. Soon static monsters appear in their own isolated windows you&#x27;ll have to shoot your way towards (their attacks can cross the void between), and before long there are the horrible hateful little blue bastards who sit there passively, soaking up shots and never attacking but actively pulling the edges of the window towards them.
It&#x27;s a clever and great little thing and I sort of hate it as much as I like it.

                              <span>So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.
I think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.

                              <span>I think its reasonable to say that the term ‘fetch quest’ is well passed the point of being a neutral descriptor and has moved firmly into the realm of full pejorative. You won&#x27;t see many games tout ‘epic fetch quests’ on their Steam Page, and you’re much more likely to hear the term lodged between the words ‘not a bloody’ and ‘again’, like two slices of exasperation-enriched bread stuffed with a shit-tier filling. Cucumber, perhaps. Not so, at least not for me, when it comes to Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. The action RPG game has more or less solved the fetch quest problem. All it took, it turns out, was some interesting world design.

                              <span>Embracer Group has divested Gearbox Entertainment from its stable of video game studios, with Take-Two Interactive purchasing the company for $460 million. This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. 
This move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…</span>

Cover story writer and editor Marcus Stewart and I traveled to Vienna, Austria, to play the game and speak with two of its leads, tech and production director and studio co-founder Gennadiy Korol and studio CEO and creative director Thomas Mahler. 
However, while the frosted glass of the front door of the two-story apartment we entered was engraved with the words &quot;Moon Studios&quot;, this studio is actually just Mahler&#x27;s workplace. Korol met us in Vienna for the cover story, but he actually lives in Israel. The rest of Moon Studios lives around the world, because Moon Studios is completely remote – the…</span>

Sometimes, all it takes to get started on a great game is to come up with a compelling mechanic, and Pepper Grinder is a prime example. The titular grinder is as powerful as it is versatile, able to drill through the ground and power all sorts of wacky devices. The difficulty curve can be choppy, and ends more quickly than it should, but that core mechanic builds a sturdy foundation that kept me entertained from start to finish. 
That core mechanic is, of course, the Grinder, a conical drilling device protagonist Pepper uses to burrow through terrain, spin switches, and defeat ene…</span>

Once a tentpole franchise in the popular run-and-gun subgenre of action games, Contra has experienced a stark downturn in recent decades. Konami&#x27;s (mostly) side-scrolling shooter franchise has often gone long stretches without a release, and the games that have come out in recent years range from middling to downright bad. With Contra: Operation Galuga, Konami taps renowned retro-style developer WayForward, best known for its work on the Shantae series, to bring the once-renowned series back to its roo…</span>

Earthblade was first announced in April 2021 before getting its first trailer at The Game Awards in 2022. The fantasy &quot;explor-action&quot; platformer stars Névoa, a child of fate who returns to uncover the mysteries of a fractured Earth. The game appears to be inspired by the Metroidvania subgenre, with the studio stating it features &quot;seamless exploration, challenging combat, and countless mysteries to pick apart.&quot; Outside of PC, Earthblade has no announced platforms.

                              <span>I was once the hottest new model on the street. Newspapers heralded my arrival in every town. The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>
