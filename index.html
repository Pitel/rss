Felix the Cat isn’t technically a Konami game. Released in 1992, it was published by Hudson and allegedly developed by the elusive Shimada Kikaku, which would explain why there are no credits to be found anywhere. It’s loosely based on the 1989 movie, which was an extension of an absolutely atrocious 1958 cartoon series. Thankfully, the game isn’t bad.

Dragon’s Dogma 2’s enemies are no pushovers, but can they stand up to The Mountain himself? Actor and World’s Strongest Man winner Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson took on Capcom’s action-RPG sequel, in a Twitch livestream with over a quarter of a million views. 


As the fabled Arisen, Dragon’s Dogma 2 has you exploring a vast open world in pursuit of the dragon that devoured your heart. Björnsson may not have felled this beast, yet, but after dispatching harpies, goblins and gorgons, he gave Capcom’s latest his seal of approval. 


Things got off to a rocky start, literally, as Björnsson’s character hefted boulders around in the game’s tutorial area. As the third most decorated strongman of all time, he couldn’t ha…</span>

                              <span>Stardew Valley, one of our favourite RPGs despite coming out almost a decade ago, still has an attentive steward in the form of developer Eric Barone. After the recent 1.6 mega-update to the game, which added a whole bunch of stuff, Barone (better known in his developer form as ConcernedApe) Xeeted out a list of fixes in the now-available 1.6.3 update. This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing &#x27;excess trash&#x27; to be fished.
Importantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don&#x27;t have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie&#x27;s. This is lovely.

                              <span>Embracer have announced that they&#x27;re selling Borderlands developers Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive, owners of 2K Games and GTA 6 developers Rockstar, for $460 million in Take-Two shares. Three Gearbox Software studios - the flagship studio in Texas, together with Gearbox Montréal and Gearbox Quebec - will change hands as part of the deal. Take-Two will also acquire the Borderlands and Tiny Tina&#x27;s Wonderlands franchises, together with Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem.


Embracer will keep and rename Gearbox Publishing San Francisco, previously known as Perfect World Entertainment. They&#x27;re also hanging onto Cryptic Studios, who went through a round of layoffs in November, together with their MMOs Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online. They&#x27;re also clinging onto Borderlands 3 support studio Lost Boys Interactive, who went through a round of layoffs in January, plus 3D scanning and reconstruction outfit Captured Dimensions. Last but not least, they&#x27;ll keep the publishing rights to the Remnant series, Hyper Light Breaker and &quot;other notable unannounced game releases&quot;.

Staff were notified by an email sent around this morning from SEGA Europe’s managing director Jurgen Post, alongside the news that Relic Entertainment, makers of Company of Heroes and Dawn of War, would be sold. As IGN point out, SEGA Europe studios Sports Interactive and Two Point Studios, makers of  Football Manager and Two Point Hospital respectively, were not mentioned in the email.

Unless your knowledge of Japanese DSiWare titles from the 2010s is really strong, it is likely that Hakokoro will have passed you by. Well, this box-based puzzler is getting a follow-up, Hakokoro V, which lands on the Japanese Switch eShop on 4th April.
Developed and published by AMZY, this is a puzzle game where you are tasked with rolling a square block around an enemy-filled arena, collecting magic orbs via the cube&#x27;s open face and dispatching your not-so-friendly foes. It&#x27;s a simple enough concept and one that looks perfectly pleasing based on the above trailer.

After a last minute delay on Switch, publisher Ziggurat is now ready to unleash Slave Zero X into the world and we can exclusively reveal that it is scheduled for launch on 11th April, 2024.
Better late than never, of course, and we&#x27;re hopeful that the delay means the game can look and perform as best as it possibly can on Nintendo&#x27;s console. To give a flavour of what to expect, Ziggurat has shared several Switch-specific screenshots, and we have to say that it&#x27;s looking pretty tasty indeed.

                              <span>After completing the Dull Steel, Cold Forge quest, another adventure awaits in the scorching Mountain Base Cave. Thus begins the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 Steeled Resolve, Blazing Forge quest, which involves a challenging time-restricted objective.


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 Steeled Resolve, Blazing Forge quest guide


When you return to Brokkr&#x27;s Smithy to check Sara&#x27;s progress, you&#x27;ll be notified of her disappearance in the Steeled Resolve, Blazing Forge quest. This area is not accessible until the main quest, A New Godsway, has been completed, but make sure you don&#x27;t go beyond that to avoid the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 point of no return. With the Flamebearer Palace Spellseal Door open, the Mountain Base Cave should now be available.

                              <span>We&#x27;re closing in now on a year since the launch of Final Fantasy XVI, the most recent (non-remake trilogy) entry in the long-running RPG franchise. Its second DLC, The Rising Tide, is just around the corner, and a PC version is on the docket too.


Final Fantasy XVI received a fairly warm response at launch, though its more action-oriented framework has certainly been the topic of fervent discussion since then. For what it&#x27;s worth, I enjoyed it, and am admittedly in the target demographic for what&#x27;s coming next: a new DLC framed around Leviathan, my personal favorite Final Fantasy summon, with more story, quests, and more.

To get the Grinder blueprint in Lightyear Frontier, you need to complete the mission &#x27;Restore Edge Cliffs&#x27;. Cleaning up the place, which is south of The Meadow biome, will award you with a new resource: Copper Ore. With Copper Ore gathered, you should unlock the blueprint permanently.

How to make the Grinder in Lightyear Frontier


Since you need Copper Ore for the blueprint, it makes sense that the metal is used in the Grinder&#x27;s construction. But that&#x27;s not the only ingredient required. To build the Grinder, you&#x27;ll need to gather:

In any case, if you are wondering how to get this weapon, we have everything you need to know below.


How to get the Ruvox in Warframe


To get the Ruvox in Warframe, you have to farm the new Disruption mission, Armatus, which is in Deimos. It’s specifically in the Sanctum Anatomica region, accessible after completing the Whispers in the Walls quest. 


In Armatus, you have to successfully defend the conduits from the Amalgam Necramech enemies that spawn upon activating a key. This progresses your mission toward a successful item rewa…</span>

Getting the Onos in Warframe, Dante Unbound update


To get the Onos in Warframe, you have to play the new Disruption node, Armatus, on Deimos. The blueprint for this weapon is on the B rotation, so if you want to target farm it, you have to successfully defend all four conduits for the first two rounds of the mode. 


After Round Two, you only have to defend two conduits to ensure a B rotation drop. Note that it is a rare drop, and you have a 5% chance to get it. However, you also do run the chance of rece…</span>

But since Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is far from the norm, the entry doesn&#x27;t explicitly specify its closing chapters. It&#x27;s not too much of a surprise, though, with the vague pieces of guidance throughout a playthrough. However, before you get blindsided like I did, here&#x27;s when to expect the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 point of no return. 


What is the exact point of no return in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2?


The Guardian Gigantus quest is the point of no return in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. Once this mission is unlocked, an NPC suggests getting some rest before starting the objective, vaguely hinting at its conclusion. It should be noted that Guardian Gigantus is the second to last main mission of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, so completing it will immedi…</span>

                              <span>Common Samples are a fairly easy resource to come by in Helldivers 2, but the trick is farming a lot of them in a single mission to maximize efficiency. Whether they&#x27;re for upgrades or a Personal Order, here&#x27;s the break down on how to get Common Samples in Helldivers 2. 


Every mission in Helldivers 2 players into all of its systems in some way. Regardless of whether you succeed or fail that mission, you&#x27;re rewarded with Requisition Slips and XP so you can purchase more Stratagems and level up your profile. If you manage to extract from a mission, you&#x27;ll escape with everything you had on your Helldiver at the time, including precious Samples. The easiest of these to acquire are Common Samples, and if you know how to farm them well, you&#x27;ll never want for them again.

                              <span>There are few spots in Dragon’s Dogma 2 where a single bridge is your only point of ingress to an area. Usually, there’s a detour, but there are a few where there isn’t. So, if you destroy one of these bridges, how long do you have to wait?


It’s hard to give you a direct answer here. A few days is the easy way to explain it, but have you ever heard the phrase “A watched pot won’t boil?” It’s a phrase that means if you do nothing but anticipate something happening, the time you wait will feel like an eternity.


I’m applying it in a more literal sense here. To be clear, I’m speaking of suspension bridges; ones made of wood. Stone bridges cannot be destroyed. For this test, I accidentally knocked down a bridge that leads to the Wyrmsblood Forest in Battahl using lightning magick. Don’t wor…</span>

The starting spawn point ultimately determines the shape of this journey, depending on the luck of the draw with seeds. Sometimes, you can find yourself basking in the sun on a hilltop, while other locations force you to swim in hot-molting lava. So, to even the odds a bit, let&#x27;s take a look at the best Minecraft Survival seeds.

                              <span>My Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 adventure started with humble beginnings. A newly anointed Arisen, I&#x27;d fled danger and manifested my own Pawn, and was well on my way to forging my own legend in this dangerous land. Then, I got some pants that barely qualify as coverings.


I&#x27;m probably only a little over double-digit hours in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, but my main character&#x27;s butt has become a constant. It is simply always there. I see them, bobbing up and down as I delve deep into a cavern. They wobble as I climb and hurdle over rocky terrain. They disappear, for a brief moment, when I pivot to strike an enemy with an arrow, only to reappear the moment I swing the camera back around.

                              <span>Wakestones are an important item in Dragon’s Dogma 2, and the Dragon’s Gaze item is a great way to track down the fragments. However, you may be hesitant to use it, so I’ll give you some details.


Here’s the important part: Dragon’s Gaze is not a consumable. That is to say that, if you use it, it doesn’t disappear from your inventory and you can continue using it whenever you want. There is no limit on how many times you use Dragon’s Gaze.


This also means that you don’t need to carry around more than one. I’ve come across four Dragon’s Gaze in my time in Dragon’s Dogma 2. It isn’t a unique item.

How to use Dragon’s Gaze


Using Dragon’s Gaze is as easy as opening the inventory, moving the cursor over it, and then selecting Use from its menu. Nothing fancy.


What it does is display Wakestone Shards on your map in your immediate vicinity. It won’t tell you where every Wakestone Shard in the world is, just the ones in your surroundings. They appear on the map as their UI icon.


Another thing to keep in mind is that this doesn’t mean you can access where these Wakestone Shards are. They might be behind a locked door only available on a quest. It might be on a high ledge that you can’t immediately reach. It just tells you where the shards are around you, not their accessibility.


Where to get Dragon’s Gaze


As I mentioned earlier, you can find a Dragon’s Gaze in many places. The one I see most frequently cited is up in Vernworth castle’s tower on the fourth floor. Another one I can name is in the Pilgrim’s Inn - Flagship in Bakbattahl. I’ve received one as a quest reward from Brant for completing The Nameless Village. They turn up, and you only need one.


What you should really take away from this guide is that the Dragon’s Gaze is not consumable. It is not a unique item. And it reveals Wakestone Shards, but only in the immediate area.

                              <span>One of the biggest facets of Stardew Valley is Farming. You’ve inherited a farm, you need to rebuild it and make money in the process, so one thing you need to figure out is which crops are best for every season. 


There are multiple schools of thought when it comes to deciding which crop is best in each season; some people swear by the ‘gold per day’ rule, favoring crops which grow quickly and yield more expensive vegetables, while others tend to favor low maintenance but constantly producing crops. 


I am part of the latter school of thought, so my suggestions will lean towards constantly producing crops for every season except Winter. While these crops may not provide as much profit as some of the other crops, they don’t need to be replanted every time you harvest the crop, which come…</span>

Blue Protocol release date and regions

However, the only confirmed date so far for a global launch is that Bandai Namco and Amazon Games plan to release Blue Protocol sometime in 2024.

                              <span>If you log on to Warframe on a major update day, there’s a slight change you may have gotten that “Arsenal Tuning” message from the Community Team. What exactly is it and why are there so many resources given for free? We can break this down below.


What is Arsenal Tuning in Warframe?


Arsenal Tuning is essentially a way to soften the blow when something popular in the meta gets nerfed. Since nerfs are hardly ever fun in a PvE game (unless something trivializes difficulty), Digital Extremes gives players a bundle of resources as compensation.


As the game’s message says, “Ordis knows the Operator may need time to grow accustomed to these changes”. So, even if your overpowered cheese builds may have been toned down a bit, the compensation for materials is a fair trade. 


Even if you did not use the abilities or items that were nerfed in the latest update, you are still eligible to receive the materials in your inbox. Chances are along with these significant balance changes, other things have been reworked so you can try out the new stuff instead.


Either way, these bundles often give you Formas which is hard to come by. That can be used for polarization for your weapons, frames, or companions, so that’s a nice boost to have on update day.

What was nerfed in the latest patch?


As of the Dante Unbound update, the following has been nerfed:



Grendel’s Nourish Helminth ability 

Viral damage decreased from 75% to 45%


Energy multiplier reduced from 2x to 1.6x





The following have had abilities or mechanics changed:



Loki’s Decoy and Switch Teleport abilities


Mirage’s Eclipse and Prism abilities


Inaros ability rework


Gara passive change


Yareli’s Aquablades, Riptide, and Merulina



As stated earlier, even if you have not utilized any of these Warframe abilities, all players will receive the Arsenal Tuning inbox message along with the free goodies upon logging in.

                              <span>Sometimes, a game is so good that when we finish it, we have to jump right back in. But some of us prefer to not lose any of our hard work, which is what New Game Plus (NG+) is for. If Dragon’s Dogma 2 is a game you want to experience again, here are the details on starting over.


How to start New Game Plus


This may seem obvious, but New Game Plus unlocks once you’ve completed Dragon’s Dogma 2. This applies to any of the endings (yes, there are multiple). You don’t need to reach the “true” ending to get New Game Plus, but you might want to reach for it anyway.


Once the game is complete, you’ll get a dialogue asking if you want to start New Game Plus. If you select it, you’ll be asked if you’re sure that you’re sure. It’s worth considering. You only have one save file in Dragon’s Dogma…</span>

For those who might not remember, the last and only other time this chest of goodies appeared was during Season 18, Season of Plunder.


Into the Light is a content update coming to Destiny 2 on April 9. To tease and prepare players for Into the Light, Bungie announced three livestreams taking place on Twitch. The first stream showed off Onslaught, while stream two focused on rewar…</span>

                              <span>Revealed on March 27, 2024, Marvel Rivals is a 6v6 team-based competitive shooter featuring some of the best-known characters in the Marvel universe. Opting for a third-person perspective, the hero shooter is a collaboration between Marvel Entertainment and NetEase. 


Already, I&#x27;m a huge fan of the art style as it&#x27;s in a similar vein to some of my favorites like Arcane, Into the Spider-Verse, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. The concept is a sound one as there&#x27;s no need to invent whole-cloth heroes and it becomes a matter of molding three to four powers for each character. In the announcement trailer, we see Magik switch to her demon form, Loki adopt the powers of Black Panther, and several combos between characters like Rocket Raccoon and Groot.

Today, developer Digital Extremes released the Dante Unbound Update for Warframe, adding a new Waframe for players to collect alongside a mainstream story expansion and a host of tweaks and changes. However, iOS players will have to wait to get their hands on it because the update has been delayed somewhere in the platform&#x27;s certification process. This doesn&#x27;t make Warframe&#x27;s iOS version unplayable, but imposes a few temporary restrictions.

                              <span>Dante, the 56th Warframe to come out, is one like no other we’ve seen so far in this game. With Dante being the new release, many eager players want to know how to acquire him. We’ll tell you the various ways below.


How to get Dante in Warframe


To get Dante in Warframe, you have to play and farm the new Armatus Disruption mission on Deimos. This can be accessed upon completing the Whispers in the Walls quest. 


This mission works just like any other Disruption mission in Warframe. You have four conduits that need a key to be activated. Upon getting that key, dropped from Key Carriers, you have to bring it to a corresponding conduit and then protect that said conduit from an enemy called an Amalgam Necramech. 


These Amalgam Necramechs act just like other conduit enemies on other plan…</span>

Completing every album can earn you tens of thousands of dice, making it worthwhile to exchange cards with others. Here&#x27;s how to trade stickers and redeem star rewards in Monopoly GO.

                              <span>ASUS&#x27; ROG Ally was the first big brand Windows portable console following on the heels of Valve&#x27;s Steam Deck launch. All of a sudden, handheld gaming saw a massive resurgence with devices that look like portable consoles but wield the full power of PC gaming.


So, what games make the most of what the ROG Ally has to offer? To start, the Ally is more powerful than the Steam Deck, but that isn&#x27;t the gadget&#x27;s real strength. Running Windows means the ROG Ally has access to a whole host of services that the Steam Deck doesn&#x27;t. So, here&#x27;s our list of games capitalizing on both the Ally&#x27;s beefy hardware and software.

                              <span>In 2020, indie studio Yellow Brick Games was formed by a collection of industry veterans with experience on triple-A franchises such as Dragon Age, Assassins’ Creed, and Mass Effect. After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.
The studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. 


The studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.

Yellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a &quot;people first&quot; work culture where employees&#x27; wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, &quot;deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.&quot;
&quot;We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release&quot;Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”</span>

Its epoynomous video game debut is a open world action RPG featuring an original story, and after fans got to try a recent public demo, we traveled to Bandai Namco to check out never-before-seen sections of the game. Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they show off a new dungeon and boss fight from Sand Land, along with peeks at Forest Land and the game&#x27;s deep vehicle customization.

                              <span>Ahead of Stellar Blade&#x27;s launch on PlayStation 5 on April 26, a demo for the game will be made available that lets players play through approximately the game&#x27;s opening hour. And ahead of the demo&#x27;s release on Friday, March 29, we got to go hands-on with it early. Join Marcus Stewart and me for a look at the game&#x27;s combat, boss fights, traversal, visuals, and more.
And for a whole lot more on Stellar Blade, you can read this feature where I spoke with Stellar Blade’s game director, Hyung-Tae Kim, and its technical director, Dong-Gi Lee, about the game&#x27;s development, how the team was inspired by Nier: Automata, and why it wanted to make a game with an ending.

We were dazzled by the brilliance of Square Enix&#x27;s Star Ocean: The Second Story R last year when the classic PS1 RPG reentered our lives in a swanky remastered form. With excellent combat, visuals and story, we thought that this was the complete package but developer Gemdrops, it turns out, had other ideas.

This year&#x27;s edition of MLB The Show has been out for over a week at the time of writing, and some of you may be wondering where our review has gotten to. We&#x27;ve taken a look at each previous release of the Sony-helmed series that came to Switch starting in 2022, and you&#x27;d be right in assuming we would take to the field with this one, as well.
Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve hit exactly the same snag that many Switch owners have, it seems — namely, we can&#x27;t access the Diamond Dynasty mode without the game crashing.

Now that we&#x27;re swiftly approaching the one-year anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, we suspect that many of you have likely completed the game at this stage. Even if you haven&#x27;t yet and are still mopping up those remaining Korok Seeds, it&#x27;s probably reasonable to assume that you&#x27;ve experienced enough of the game to conclude how it stacks up nexts to its predecessor, Breath of the Wild.
Take our lovely video Producer, Felix, for instance. In his latest video, he expresses how he much prefers Breath of the Wild to Tears of the Kingdom after having experienced both games. He goes into a good deal of detail about why this is the case, so we&#x27;d encourage you to watch the whole thing to fully understand his reasoning. That said, we gave both games a score of 10/10 here on Nintendo Life, and we absolutely adore them for different reasons.

GameStop has announced that it has made an unspecified number of job cuts as it grapples with a sharp decline in revenue.
As reported by Reuters (thanks, IGN), the firm saw $1.794 billion in sales for its fourth-quarter of the fiscal year; a fairly drastic drop from the $2.226 billion earned over the same period the previous year. Net income faired a bit better at $63.1 million compared to $48.2 million, but there seems to be growing concern at the decline in sales as digital media sinks its teeth into the industry.

It has been a little over a month since the &#x27;Omega&#x27; update landed in No Man&#x27;s Sky and Hello Games clearly hasn&#x27;t paused for breath as it today unveiled the next new patch.
The &#x27;Orbital&#x27; update will be blasting off today and while it might not be quite as expedition-focused as some of those that we have seen in the past, it does introduce a couple of new features that are sure to go down well with the ship fans out there.

As spotted by Siliconera, the bento box will cost 1,750 yen (around $11.55) and is effectively a lunch box that will be sold at train stations and two stores at Hakata Station, Fukuoka. You&#x27;ll be enjoying some lovely fried squid rings, Yamaya dry mentaiko, and some pretty awesome nori seaweed featuring artwork from the game itself.

With Princess Peach: Showtime! now available on the Switch, Nintendo is beginning to turn its focus to the return of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Ahead of its release in May, it&#x27;s been sharing pre-order details and other information.

As noted by many who played the original GameCube release, this whole scene has now been animated in the new version of the game.

Improved controls, tougher ships, more useful formations, better Attack Move command, more HUD options, and more types of War Games mode objectives are among the tweaks and improvements detailed by game director Lance Mueller in a 3000-word blogblast. &quot;This past month, everyone was heads down discussing every post we saw from Steam, social, Reddit, Discord and beyond,&quot; he explained.

That might be the closest result yet. Now if only Frog Detective could become a Blade Runner charged with helping attend a big dance party. Onwards! This week, I ask you to pick between a thing that skips frustration and a thing that is always, always there for you. What&#x27;s better: a button to unlock all unlocks or the spell Fireball?

Apparently, the original was a dark fantasy action RPG with roguelike elements and MMO subscription models before developer Flagship Studios shut down. Then it was re-released a bunch of times, with London giving way to Tokyo in one expansion. Now, Hellgate&#x27;s original creator Bill Roper has announced he&#x27;s working on a brand new Hellgate game under his new studio Lunacy Games.

Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition succeeds where Dragon’s Dogma 2 spluttered, quietly yet capably adapting to handheld hardware. Keeping performance up requires a fair bit of fine-tuning the graphics settings, and a girthsome install size might trouble the internal drives of smaller models, but otherwise, Forbidden West is just as portable-friendly as Horizon Zero Dawn. And that’s still one of the best Steam Deck games around.

                              <span>I went into Open Roads pretty cold, knowing only that it was a story-driven road trip game with some element of mystery to it. The mystery is really just a backdrop, though - a device to better bring forth the themes of family and secrets. Most specifically it&#x27;s about mother-daughter relationships, as we join single mum Opal and her sixteen-year-old daughter Tess on a short (from our point of view) but bittersweet road trip when, going through Opal&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home post-funeral, they discover she may have had an affair decades before. Can you ever really know the people you love? Does it matter? If you left your daughter&#x27;s early-00s flip phone back at the motel, would you turn around and lose four hours, or hope it&#x27;s still there on the way back?

                              <span>I approve of the recent trend towards making building games as relaxing as possible (e.g. Summerhouse). Today sees the release of a new one on Steam, this one a teeny medieval city builder called Le Château that gives you strict limitations for building a castle. You can have a go of the demo for free - I like it a bunch.

                              <span>A couple of decades ago there was a period when all videogames and especially all Unreal Engine videogames had to be brown and grey and dingy. &quot;The Gears of Warrification of graphics,&quot; we used to call it, huddled up in the chest-high trenches with our Xbox 360 controllers. Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. 


Developers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.

                              <span>Is there a developer more fiendishly dedicated to giving fans endless returns on their initial investment than No Man’s Sky studio Hello Games? It’s not a competition, mind, but they’d surely be a strong contender if it were. Despite dropping the Omega update just last month, and unveiling fantasy survival game Light No Fire at last year’s Geoffies, the team are back once more with the Orbital update. It looks to be a sizeable one too, with ship customisation and a “complete space station overhaul” among the new features. You can read the full patch notes here. I hope it includes a note about how much sleep they’re all getting, because I’m starting to worry.

                              <span>Like the good works of Calvin Klein, these genes come pre-distressed. Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.
This look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.

Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play, third-person team shooter where two teams of six heroes and villains go head to head with each other in destructible arenas. I can&#x27;t say its reveal trailer has me particularly pumped - the game looks and feels a bit like it&#x27;s ten years too late. Still, why not come and have a gander at it below.

                              <span>When Herbert Spencer coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; to describe Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary theory, I&#x27;m pretty sure he didn&#x27;t envisage the rise of a species of videogame, the survival sim, which would one day itself suffer an unsustainable population explosion during the layoff-ridden years of 2023 and 2024. What does it take to survive as a survival sim, in these days when every other game seems to be a survival sim? What separates the fit from the extinct? If you&#x27;re Palworld, the answer is gleefully borrowing and travestying monster concepts from a celebrated Nintendo series. If you&#x27;re Enshrouded, it&#x27;s all about having a really neat building system. And if you&#x27;re Dune: Awakening, the next game from Conan Exiles developer Funcom, the trick may lie with sandworms.

                              <span>Is there a definitive geological difference between rock and stone? Google tells me the main consensus is that stones are just smaller rocks, which sounds like a flimsy distinction to base a catchphrase on. I’m not sure when this would come up, unless maybe you were a biblical heretic trying to dunk on the people bludgeoning you to death by correcting them in some last gasp pettiness, but it still bothers me. Anyway, colony survival game First Dwarf cares not for rock, only stone, along with the wood you’ll use as the building blocks of your colonies. This is me burying the lede deeper than the mines of Moria, of course, because First Dwarf also has a tiny talking dragon companion that sits on the shoulder of the giant dwarven mech you use to swing a hammer at horrible toxic shitlizards. The dragon learnt your language by sneaking herself in a library. Do go on, game.

                              <span>Fallen London and Sunless Skies developers Failbetter Games have blogged about the dark art of running a sustainable business, while sharing a tiny bit more about their next, unannounced game. Said game is apparently a change of genre from Failbetter&#x27;s previous, exceedingly narrative-driven open world titles and free-to-play RPGs. It&#x27;ll also be a little less oppressive, aiming for a feeling of &quot;fireside menace&quot; - that is, &quot;an awareness of the world&#x27;s dangers, but also warmth and comfort&quot;, which certainly feels like an appropriate mood for a time of mass layoffs and game cancellations, to say nothing of recent conspiracy-fuelled harassment campaigns.

                              <span>Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the post-apocalyptic wilderness, the giant dinosaur robots return. In fact, they never left! Go-gettin&#x27;, arrow-shootin&#x27; warrior Aloy managed to delay the end of the world in Horizon Zero Dawn, but the death train is still chugging along to all life on Earth station via a (currently resonant) eco-disaster. In Horizon Forbidden West it&#x27;s because the AI created to heal the planet from the prior extinction event caused by humans isn&#x27;t working properly. Gaia, said AI, has been turned off and split into different parts, so yours and Aloy&#x27;s job sequel is to, firstly, reboot Gaia, and secondly collect all these subordinate functions. But nobody turned off the making robots button, which means this action RPG in a massive open-world still involves fighting rocket-launcher T-rexes. It&#x27;ll shock no one that this makes for a very good video game.

                              <span>Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven&#x27;t played it, have I, so I&#x27;ll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.
Not least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now.

There&#x27;s an extra sweetener in 1.0 announced today, however: a Castlevania crossover where players can fight Simon Belmont and make off with his whip.

                              <span>On March 31st, Ubisoft&#x27;s open world racing game The Crew will be turned off for good. As of right now, no one can buy the ten-year-old racer, but come the end of the month, even those that did buy it will no longer be able to play it.

On April 18th, The Crew Motorfest will arrive on Steam after several months available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft&#x27;s own launcher, providing a new venue to buy the third entry in the series. Or perhaps that should be &quot;rent&quot;.

                              <span>I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to &quot;a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it&#x27;s 1000 metres in extent&quot;. Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?


Still, I&#x27;m very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it&#x27;s the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based &quot;immersive experiences&quot; and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it&#x27;s a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it&#x27;s inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet &quot;secret cities&quot; given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn&#x27;t make the last bus out of town.

                              <span>Good news for people who don’t cringe violently every time they encounter the phrase “Narrative Legos”! We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it&#x27;s an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,&quot; says Levine. 


Judas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness.

                              <span>If you’ve  read my duology on spending far too long queuing in Hitman, you’ll know I’ve a predilection for the virtual people watching of NPCs in games that have some sort of schedule system. &quot;It’s a wholesome pursuit of game design knowledge!&quot; I stammer, as the guards approach. &quot;It gives me a greater appreciation for the obscure details lurking in the hidden corners of virtual cities!&quot; I protest, as I’m clapped in chains after being caught staring through a blacksmiths window for four hours watching him eat the same heel of bread, rubbing my hands together and grinning manically. Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.
Alfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.

                              <span>While the PC release of Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition has effectively made my PS5 ownership pointless, I can’t stay mad at it. Besides being a sumptuous, endlessly satisfying sci-fi romp with one of the prettiest open worlds in gaming, it’s also a very respectable porting job, with stable performance that scales well on aged PC hardware all the way up to glistening 4K rigs.
There are some imperfections, but generally, this shouldn’t be a repeat of Horizon Zero Dawn’s need for a post-launch patch regimen. On all the hardware I’ve tested, Forbidden West looks good to go, especially when choosing the right settings can smooth out performance even more.

                              <span>Swashbuckling third-person action-RPG Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn is, amongst other things, a gentle homage to New Zealand, developer A44 Games&#x27;s country of origin. You do have to look for it, mind you. The game&#x27;s art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.
Main character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking &quot;blackpowder&quot; pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed &quot;Hosts&quot; that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor&#x27;s spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology.

                              <span>Troubled city building game Cities: Skylines 2 is getting a little less troubled, as new patch 1.1.0f1 adds various performance and bug fixes alongside the main event: much requested mod support and tools in the form a nifty editor. We got a first look at the new editor tools last October, which looks to simplify the process by combining what was previously several different separate editors into a single application. It was later available only to some closed beta testers, but is now released for everyone. Emphasis on everyone, actually, since the tool looks refreshingly approachable, even for those with basically no modding experience.

                              <span>Maintaining the thrum of a finely-tuned citybuilder has to be one of the most satisfying acts of video game plate-spinning around. Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that&#x27;s the good stuff right there. Of course, it&#x27;s not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it&#x27;s the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it&#x27;s just that they won&#x27;t ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.
Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of &#x27;relaxed&#x27; and &#x27;something more&#x27;. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you&#x27;re free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.

                              <span>Yesterday I posted a story about Helldivers 2 game master Joel, which showed him delivering an unreleased vehicle to a random group of players before vanishing into the ether. But this morning came a thunderous plot twist. Someone on team RPS was contacted by a verified source with first hand knowledge of Joel&#x27;s shady activities. The source has confirmed that APC-deliverer Joel isn&#x27;t anything but an imposter, a fake, a generous fraud. The Real Joel, it seems, isn&#x27;t so brazen with his actions.

                              <span>Palia, a cute-looking life sim MMO inspired by e.g. Stardew Valley, has been in beta since last year, but now it&#x27;s officially out on Steam, where many more people can download and play it. With this launch comes a pretty substantial update - Patch 0.178, full notes here - which adds a new questline and Temple to explore, new furniture, and a bunch of new spring flowers and trees to grow in your garden. There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under &#x27;Adjustments&#x27;. The patch notes say simply &quot;What does he want? Does he come in peace?&quot; which makes him sound way more sinister than I think he is, but as you can see from the screenshot, he isn&#x27;t not sinister.

For anyone currently gathered around the hill, searching the pockets of their N7 hoodies for more heavy objects to fling at me, however, here’s some good news: the as-yet unnamed Mass Effect 5  is in the capable hands of “trilogy vets”, according to project director Michael Gamble, via Le Epic Musk Zone (OP didn’t steal), formerly Twitter. The team heading up the space game franchise’s next entry comprises of veterans of the first three games in various leading roles, namely: Art Director, Game Director, Creative Director, and Executive Producer.

                              <span>The source code of Italian anti-piracy platform Piracy Shield appears to have been leaked online. Nine repositories claim to contain everything from the front end, data models, storage and filesystem, through to the platform&#x27;s API and internal documentation. Presented with a manifesto of sorts, the unknown leaker claims that Piracy Shield &quot;isn&#x27;t just a failed attempt to combat online piracy,&quot; it&#x27;s a &quot;dangerous gateway&quot; to censorship &quot;disguised as a solution to piracy.&quot;

It wasn’t until 2021, however, that we got our first proper look at Stellar Blade during a PlayStation showcase, where it was shown with its former title, Project Eve.
For those not paying close attention to Korean video game news, it felt like it came out of nowhere. In the trailer, a beautiful woman is seen fighting a hybrid monster robot. She uses a sword to break off one of the cyborg creature’s arms to use as a weapon before being thrown through a wall, revealing the fight was happening on a space station all along. As she careens through space further and further away from the station, it is revealed that a much …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it&#x27;s no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.
Thirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.
The relevant section says, &quot;Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.&quot;
There&#x27;s really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there&#x27;s no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft&#x27;s private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.

Last week, The Mushroom Kingdom&#x27;s beloved ruler made her solo Switch debut with Princess Peach: Showtime!, an impressive performance in an approachable production that gracefully leaps between genres and finally delivers a star vehicle for a woman that has spent too long out of the spotlight.
Our royal reviewer PJ O&#x27;Reilly came away most impressed by the princess&#x27; performance, awarding it an 8/10 in his review and saying that, despite some technical snags, it has &quot;creativity, style, and fun to spare,&quot; with &quot;Nintendo finally  everyone&#x27;s favourite imaginary princess the rollicking adventure she deserves.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;It was a big letdown.&quot;.
To the disappointment of many, including us, it was confirmed earlier this year that Free Radical Design, the developer behind the highly anticipated revival of TimeSplitters, would be closed down by Embracer Group and the game ultimately cancelled.
It was a dire end to what many had hoped would be a grand return to the shooter franchise that took the world by storm in the early &#x27;00s. For Steve Ellis, co-founder of Free Radical Design, the game&#x27;s cancellation and studio closure was seemingly enough to deter him from ever being involved in TimeSplitters ever again.

It&#x27;s been a minute since we highlighted a particularly impressive island from Animal Crossing. New Horizons, but we thought this one was worth it. We&#x27;ve seen many sublime efforts since the game launched back in March 2020, but the crossover appeal of mixing in another of video gaming&#x27;s great isles really tickled our nostalgia bone.
This particular example incorporates elements of Myst, the genre-defining environmental puzzle/adventure game that took over the world back in the &#x27;90s.

When My Time at Sandrock sprouted onto Switch in November 2023, it&#x27;s safe to say that it wasn&#x27;t in the best condition. Aside from playing things a little too safe, the farm sim was awash with dull graphics and performance issues, making it far from the cream of the crop.
Fortunately, in the time since launch, developer Pathea Games has released a handful of updates to get things running a little smoother. Today, another one has arrived, with the &#x27;New Year Better Me&#x27; free update bringing Sandrock up to ver. 1.2.2 in style.

                              <span>Tune-a fish.
After last week&#x27;s Splatoon 3 music shenanigans (in which Nintendo uploaded and removed one track only to quickly replace it with another), you might assume that there would be a short break before we heard any more tunes from the Splatlands. But you would be wrong! This is Splatoon that we&#x27;re talking about, and new music waits for no man.
So we arrive at today&#x27;s addition to the pantheon of squid songs, &#x27;Suffer No Fools&#x27;. This one sees Pearl and Marina of Off the Hook facing off against &#x27;Fire &amp; Ice&#x27; (aka Shiver and Frye from Deep Cut) in a hard-hitting, abuse-hurling rap battle. Okay, it&#x27;s not that hard-hitting, but for four ink-based beings, there&#x27;s plenty of fire in the booth.

                              <span>Playing this made us Saddlefront.
Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection should have been a slam dunk. Take two of the most beloved Star Wars games ever made and their DLC, touch them up a bit, add modern multiplayer support, and release them. Easy money, right? You’d think so, but the reality is that Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection is a massive disappointment, largely thanks to a mountain of technical issues and server and connection problems when playing multiplayer.
First things first: Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection collects Pandemic Studios’ Star Wars: Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005), slaps them into a single package, and adds support for modern online multiplayer. It does exactly what it says on the box, but the problems with the Switch version start before you even launch it for the first time. These games, which ran on the PS2 and original Xbox and fit on DVDs that could only hold nine gigabytes of data, are now a whopping 33GB+, so you have to have a micro SD card to even download and play the game on a standard Switch or Switch Lite. From there, you’re taken to a launcher that lets you choose your Battlefront.

                              <span>A copyright complaint filed by Mediaset España, EGEDA, Atresmedia, and Movistar Plus, escalated Friday when a judge ordered ISPs to prevent eight million Telegram users from accessing the service in Spain. Expected imminently, the blockade is Telegram&#x27;s punishment for not helping to identify IPTV pirates. Described as “necessary” and “proportional” by the judge, the order was made on behalf of rightsholders pursuing a private criminal prosecution.

I sure didn’t! That was over three years ago during the heights of a worldwide pandemic, though, so I think we can forgive ourselves a little. Anyway, Ark: The Animated Series has now arrived out of the blue, dropping its first six episodes on streaming service Paramount+.

Into that debate has waded the CEO of graphics card giants Nvidia to drop a prediction that can only be described as searingly flammable: we’ll see games where everything seen on-screen is fully generated by AI, in real-time, within the next 10 years.

But that one dull spot has already been polished out by modders, who are offering more convenient (and less expensive) ways to pick up items that you’ll either need to potentially grind or cough up real money for.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It&#x27;s the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.
Millennia is perhaps the Civ-like that&#x27;s clung most tightly to the genre&#x27;s apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they&#x27;re clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t a particularly good student.

                              <span>Here’s one for all you connoisseurs of the horrific consequences of your own actions. Regicide-em-up visual novel Slay the Princess’ new update brings with it new dialogue and music, fleshing out the game with additional choices, expanded scenes, and orchestral renditions of some choice tracks. The new content takes the form of new animations and “more than 3,000 words of additional and restructured dialogue choices and conversations.” That is easily enough words to tell the Stanley Parable-esque narrator that you’re on to him and whatever mind games he’s playing, with enough left over for the other voices in your head to make you doubt your own morality with alarming frequency.

                              <span>One of my favourite things about Helldivers 2 is the fact it&#x27;s home to a human game master,  known as &quot;Joel&quot;, who controls the narrative. Joel&#x27;s been known to leave surprises, namely mechs before they officially launched a while back. And now he&#x27;s seemingly granted a group of lucky players the chance to ride about in an armoured truck outfitted with guns. Maybe, just maybe this signals their imminent release?

The work of Struct9 founder Matej Vanco, it hands you a distressingly unwieldy and roofless hovership and cuts you adrift in a vast ocean of malevolent mathematics.

                              <span>At first glance, this shadow-hopping top-downer looks like a nostalgic stealth game designed to evoke the boxy subterranean environments of the first Metal Gear Solid. But really it is a tough single-player fighting game with stealth bits attached. It is closer in design to kung-fu brawler Sifu than it is to any of Solid Snake&#x27;s various mischiefs. And while this mash-up of influences intrigues me, it can also feel like a layer cake of awkwardly clashing flavours. Like that very pretty but questionable cake, Raw Metal feels a little underbaked.

                              <span>Graham wrote about WitchHand last month when the game came out. He compared it to Stacklands, and I can see where he was coming from. It&#x27;s a cute, deckbuilding strategy game where you&#x27;re a witch building up strength to take on some horrible void-y demon-y things. It has much higher stakes than Stacklands, but most importantly, you summon cat familiars in it, and they go &#x27;meow!&#x27;

                              <span>There’s a teaser image on the wall. We stare at it and we think that’s the whole multiplayer shooter set in the Control franchise. Then, Remedy sneak a second teaser image alongside some tantalising lore snippets into their latest investor report (Thanks, resetera!) Also there’s an air fryer that turns nuggets into miniature black holes, or something. I’m not sure because, honestly, I never learned to appreciate Control’s wonderful architecture and lore because the combat made me want to gnaw my fingers off. Good news, then, for everyone except me specifically. We’ve got a few more scraps of info about its (presumably) almost entirely combat focused spin-off title, currently known as ‘Condor’. 


“After the Hiss invasion, the Oldest House is under lockdown: a boiling pot of volatile and dangerous supernatural forces,” forewarns the infographic. “Trapped within is the last vestige of the Federal Bureau of Control who will need to take a stand and push back to regain control.” You can take shifts watching the full image in case it does anything untoward below.

                              <span>On top of announcing the release date for Final Fantasy 14&#x27;s next expansion, Dawntrail, at PAX East over the weekend, producer Yoshi-P set Final Fantasy tongues wagging even further by mentioning the words &quot;Final Fantasy 9&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; in the same sentence. Many of the pre-order and special edition bonus items players can get with the upcoming Dawntrail expansion are suspiciously FF9-themed, you see, but when pointing this out to PAX-goers, Yoshi-P said &quot;the reason is a secret&quot; for now, sparking fresh rumours about Square Enix&#x27;s supposed Final Fantasy IX remake/remaster.

                              <span>Every weekend, indie devs show off current work on Twitter&#x27;s #screenshotsaturday tag. And every Monday, I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by the feature every single video game on this green Earth should have (a grappling hook), along with waterparks, a plant knight, a chunky shotgun, a kitbashed hovercarrier, and heaps more. Check out all these attractive and interesting indie games!

                              <span>GTA 6 is facing development troubles, leaving leadership “nervous” that the hotly anticipated open world crime-athon could be “falling behind’ expected schedules. That’s according to Kotaku, who were told by an anonymous source that studio heads are “worried” that the game could miss 2025 completely and not see release until 2026. Kotaku were told that the studio is still “aiming” for a Spring 2025 release date, but sources feel Fall of the same year is more plausible. However, the title could be delayed until 2026 as a “fallback plan.”

                              <span>Fantasy action-RPG Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has had a tumultuous launch week: praised by reviewers, slated for its performance issues, and berated for its microtransactions, which appear to have been stealthily added after the game was sent to critics. Now begins the labour of patching the game. Capcom have released a few hints about forthcoming Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 updates. Their plans for the PC version include letting players acquire dwellings earlier on in the story, improving quality when DLSS super resolution is enabled, and adding the option to start a new game when save data already exists.

                              <span>Days Gone is that zombie x motorbike open world game (except they were at pains to point out that Freakers weren&#x27;t zombies) that Sony did for PS4 in 2019, and ported to PC in 2021 - both years after people were done with Sons Of Anarchy as a thing. As alluded to in The Maw this week, there hasn&#x27;t been much news out of Bend Studios since then, but they&#x27;re now hiring for a lead project manager for &quot;crafting our next high-profile AAA title.&quot; Another clue? The successful applicant must have experience &quot;with an emphasis on live operations&quot; and &quot;in leadership roles shipping AAA live service games&quot;. Hmmm.

I landed back in the UK from GDC on Saturday afternoon, and my brain and eyeballs still feel as though they&#x27;re being gently sautéed in a medicinal blend of oil and vinegar. The sun and sky bear down with a terrible, holy light and I can&#x27;t seem to conjure any warmth into my elbows. In the street outside, a small dog is barking. Soon, very soon, I will catch that dog, place it in a box and FedEx it to China.

                              <span>No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of &quot;the greatest of all time&quot; inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that&#x27;s what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we&#x27;re taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.
Though we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we&#x27;ll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.
Will this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. 
While this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you&#x27;ll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts!

                              <span>Last week, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 was released to critical acclaim followed by intense fan backlash. While the game itself is enjoyable to most, it launched with microtransactions that provide in-game currency, as well as a litany of technical issues for some players. Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the &quot;near future,&quot; but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.
In addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements. For starters, the Pawn Guild now sells a lot more &quot;Art of Metamorphosis&quot; items, which is how you can change the appearance of a character or pawn after they&#x27;ve already been created.

                              <span>Dawntrail, the fifth expansion for Final Fantasy XIV, is coming on July 2. The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  
The $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. 
During PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: 
Collector’s Box ($155.00)

Dawntrail Special Art Box 
Expertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65&quot; x W 4.52&quot; x D 5.90&quot;/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)
Adventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53&quot; x 29.52&quot;/42cm x 75cm)
The Unending Journey Notebook (5.90&quot; x 4.33&quot;/15cm x 11cm)
Adventurer’s Pen Case (8.26&quot; x 9.44&quot;/21cm x 24cm)
Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)

In-game Item: Ark Mount 
In-game Item: Garnet Minion 
In-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon 
While the Digital Collector&#x27;s Edition and Collector&#x27;s Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector&#x27;s Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. 
Pre-orders for the standard and collector&#x27;s edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT. Doing so at certain retailers grants the bonus in-game items: Wind-up Zidane Minion and Azeyma&#x27;s Earrings.</span>

                              <span>Stellar Blade, the flashy action game from ShiftUp, isn&#x27;t officially out until late April, but eager players can get their hands on the game as soon as this week. A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game&#x27;s opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.


Game director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, &quot;This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story.&quot;
Stellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January&#x27;s State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.
Stellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26. Its demo launches on March 29 at 7 AM PDT / 2 PM GMT.

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.</span>

Accompanied by the usual dire warnings, the stories claim that a new overseas anti-piracy system has Brits &quot;braced for a crackdown&quot; because it could &quot;stop Brits watching illegal streams for good.&quot; Perhaps the Premier League should buy this system right now? Yeah, about that.

                              <span>Acolyte of the Altar, the roguelike deckbuilder with a wasteland twist from developer Black Kite Games, hits PC via Steam on March 25. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch next week, Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer, which features plenty of deckbuilder action and another taste of this Magic: The Gathering and Shadow of the Colossus-inspired game. 
&quot;Journey through desolate wastelands and hunt down colossal Beasts to grow stronger and serve your chosen Patron deity,&quot; the game&#x27;s description reads. 
Check out the Acolyte of the Altar launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Acolyte of the Altar continues to look great (and spooky), and we&#x27;re excited to try our hands at its unique style of deckbuilder. 
&quot;Beware,&quot; the game&#x27;s Steam page reads. &quot;Beasts grow stronger during battle, allowing them to consume your creatures or counter your spells. Carve profane Gifts from these behemoths and grow stronger to serve your Patron. But serve them to what end?&quot;
That is the question players will answer when Acolyte of the Altar hits PC via Steam on March 25, 2024. If you&#x27;re interested, you can play a demo of the game on Steam right now. 
Here are some Acolyte of the Altar screenshots to enjoy in the meantime:

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora&#x27;s Mask&#x27;s unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.
Join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

                              <span>Velan Studios, the team behind Knockout City, has announced it is entering a reorganization that will likely result in layoffs. 
In a post to X (formerly known as Twitter), the studio&#x27;s co-founders Guha and Karthik Bala revealed the team was working on a big project that an outside partner suddenly canceled. As a result, it might not be able to maintain its current team size; 46 out of 121 employees were given notice they may be laid off in the next 60 days. 
“This is a rough environment for a lot of indie studios, and like them, we are faced with some very hard choices,” Velan writes in the post. Should the worst come, Velan states it will do its best to support affected staff members. You can read the full post below.

                              <span>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is one of the year’s most anticipated games, and by most accounts, the experience lives up to the hype. The game earned rave reviews from most critics, including a 9 out of 10 from us. But now that it’s out in the wild, Steam players have bombarded the RPG with negative reviews due to its problematic launch performance and day-one microtransactions.
In terms of performance problems, Steam players have reported issues such as framerate drops, freezes, and crashes. Capcom has acknowledged these issues in a Steam blog post where it says, “To all those looking forward to this game, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,” and adds, “We are investigating/fixing critical problems such as crashes and freezing.

                              <span>Square Enix today revealed a new look at Final XVI: The Rising Tide, the upcoming piece of DLC scheduled to launch as part of the game&#x27;s expansion pass. The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. 
Back in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game&#x27;s story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. 
The new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. 



Are you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</span>

                              <span>Grasshopper Manufacture announced during its summer showcase last year that its 2011 supernatural action game Shadows of the Damned is getting an encore in the form of a remaster. We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.
The newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. 

Shadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game&#x27;s writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. 
Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

But there&#x27;s been another Summerhouse development this week that has arguably delighted me even more. Solo developer Friedemann took to Xwitter on Monday to detail all the games that inspired him to make Summerhouse in the first place, and there are some really surprising, but fascinating call outs in there, including Stronghold Crusader and Sword &amp; Sworcery. I love it when developers go in-depth about things they&#x27;ve seen in other games and tried to riff on in their own creations, so please, let&#x27;s make this a tradition for all new game releases, yeah?

                              <span>Readers may be aware that I am a Warhammer 40K orbiter, but I am not of Warhammer 40K. Recent events have conspired so that I have experienced a bunch of Warhammer 40K in a way that exposes me to the world passively, without lore dumping. I played the PowerWash Sim x 40K crossover DLC and loved it for just putting cool big machines in front of me and refusing to explain further, so when James picked Darktide as this month&#x27;s RPS Game Club Game, like someone incautiously opening the door to Mormons, I was ready to let more of the God Emperor into my life. Except, having played some Darktide, I do not want to play Darktide. For me, playing Darktide does, in some measure, get in the way of enjoying Darktide.

                              <span>Being at once repellent and compelling is some kind of criterion for Real Art Status, and Horses - developed by Saturnalia developers Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - certainly earns that accolade. Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it&#x27;s also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year&#x27;s Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.

                              <span>Airships have an odd place in games. They pop up as a central idea in a fair few games, but there hasn&#x27;t really been a definitive one about actually piloting your own.
Passing By - A Tailwind Journey isn&#x27;t aiming for that, I think, but it nonetheless captures a key part of the appeal such a game should have. It&#x27;s the sense of drifting, both with the wind and with life more generally, and the stretches of not particularly much happening. But in a good way. This is a game about taking it easy, choosing to sail by the less remarkable things unless you happen to fancy stretching your legs, and having only the trust that the currents will take you where you&#x27;re meant to go when they get around to it. It&#x27;s not a purely vibe-based game, but you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy it a lot more if you can appreciate the mood.

                              <span>Last time I checked, my pawn Bronco sat at 80 in the monthly leaderboard of the pawn global rankings. Not forgetting that this is pre-release, so his place within the top 100 isn&#x27;t quite as good as it seems. This pains me. I am saddened that my sweet, sweet boy Bronco isn&#x27;t being picked up by adventurers as much as I&#x27;d like. He may not be a 1:1 recreation of a popular anime character or like, Tony Blair, but he is fantastic at shredding monsters.
Thing is, his ranking means that I&#x27;m not doing enough. Right now, I need to make his CV more appealing to prospective clientele and I need to become the agent he deserves. Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 may be an action RPG, but it is also about being the best agent you can possibly be.

                              <span>One of the neat things about massive Amazon sales, especially if you’re not keen on filling their coffers specifically, is that rival retailers often counter with big deals of their own. The best one I’ve seen during the current Amazon Spring sale is this Ebuyer offer on the excellent Crucial T500 SSD: the spacious 2TB model isn’t just cut down from £163 to £140, but it comes with a free Gamesplanet code for Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 arrives on PC and consoles today, but despite high critical acclaim when reviews hit earlier this week, players on Steam have begun review-bombing Capcom&#x27;s high fantasy RPG after the appearance of some sudden and confusing microtransactions. These weren&#x27;t present in the press build of the game, and players are so up in arms about them that the game is currently sitting on a fat red &quot;Mostly Negative&quot; Steam rating based on over 11,000 reviews and counting.

                              <span>Seeing as Path Of Exile 2 has already undergone a curious journey from &#x27;sequel released as expansion&#x27; to &#x27;actual sequel&#x27; in the four years since its announcement, not to mention years of delays, what&#x27;s one more diversion? The action-RPG&#x27;s developers announced last night that the closed beta planned to start on the 7th of June will now not. They think they could have something ready by then but it wouldn&#x27;t be up to their standards, so what&#x27;s the hurry?

Take this Ugreen Docking Station, a longtime member of our best Steam Deck accessories guide: Prime members can have one for 30% in the UK and 40% in the US. Gated as they are, these savings make Ugreen’s dock less than half the price of Valve’s official Steam Deck Docking Station, despite it providing a similarly healthy supply of ports and jacks.

                              <span>Last night, IGN posted a news piece about how Undawn, a free-to-play survival game starring Will Smith as some kind of apocalypse pal called Trey, has been a massive flop. Released in June 2023 for mobile and PC, Undawn had an allegedly huge budget, according to Reuters sources, but which only brought in under $300K last month, as estimated by research firm Appamgic. And on hearing this news everyone went: &quot;Sorry, what are you talking about?&quot;

Nor will they be making any DLC or expansions for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, for that matter - a stance I 100% respect as the studio starts to think about what&#x27;s next for them.

                              <span>Last month, developers Jyamma announced Enotria: The Last Song, an Italian-inspired Soulslike where masks give you powers. It was originally due out on June 21st, but then FromSoftware announced that Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree would also launch on the same day. Not ideal. So, Jyamma delayed Enotria&#x27;s release, and in an announcement at last night&#x27;s Future Games Show, we now know it&#x27;s launching in August. It has, however, dropped itself into another conundrum: Black Myth: Wukong, another hotly anticipated Soulslike, arrives a day earlier.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is, as a game per se, very good! It’s creative and intelligent and lets you fill other players’ worlds with recruitable humanoid versions of your pet cats. Still, a technical masterclass it is not. In my performance analysis, I touched on DD2 being particularly unplayable on the Steam Deck, suffering from sub-10fps framerates and a bunch of broken settings. Since that was based on pre-release code, I had quietly hoped that Capcom could pull something – anything – out of the bag to salvage handheld PC play in time for launch day, but now the time has come, I’ve checked again, and nope. This RPG adventure simply doesn’t work on the Steam Deck, and probably never will.

Whatever the intent, DoodStream&#x27;s operators are now being sued by Hollywood, Netflix, Amazon and Apple, who apparently identified them as long ago as last summer.

                              <span>Still Wakes the Deep, the atmospheric horror game from the makers of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, has a new trailer and a June release date. First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. 
Developed by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.


Still Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. 
For more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year. You can read more about what the studio has in store for that game here.</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">

                              <img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2023/08/11/36603f58/baldurs_gate_3_art_crop.jpg" loading="lazy" class="media-object__media article-image" />

                              <span>Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. 
As reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. &quot;We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that&#x27;s made to create DLCs or expansions,&quot; Vincke said. &quot;We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It&#x27;s not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”
Not only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that &quot;it&#x27;s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it&#x27;s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.&quot;


While Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There&#x27;s no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see. 
Baldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. 
As for other Dungeons &amp; Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there&#x27;s a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze&#x27;s in-development D&amp;D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft&#x27;s D&amp;D survival sim. 
You can read our review of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been one month since Balatro, the poker-inspired deckbuilding roguelite, was released, and it has taken the gaming world by storm. In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. 
For some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn&#x27;t share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…</span>

                              <span>Ark: The Animated Series has surprised launched today on Paramount +. Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.
The series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. 
The show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. 


To mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.


Meanwhile, we&#x27;re still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.</span>

We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.


Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level t…</span>

                              <span>Mention Lionhead&#x27;s &#x27;05 management sim about running a film studio and someone will crash through the wall, Kool-Aid Man style, to say they really liked it and there should be a remake or a sequel. In recent years there have been a few attempts to make a game like The Movies, with games like Moviehouse and Filmmaker Tycoon sitting pretty at &#x27;mostly negative&#x27; status on Steam because they are not, in fact, like The Movies beyond the basic premise. But Blockbuster Inc. has shouldered its way into the conversation, wearing big puffy trousers, shouting through an old-timey megaphone, and openly billing itself as a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to The Movies. It&#x27;s launching on June 6th this year, but you can play the prologue on Steam for free right now.

                              <span>In November last year, the Australian post-apocalyptic CRPG Broken Roads was abruptly delayed mere days before it was meant to come out. Review code had even been sent out to press. But it was clear that the game needed more time in the oven, as developers Drop Bear Bytes acknowledged they needed &quot;additional polish time and QA manpower&quot; to test the &quot;thousands of permutations&quot; available in its deeply decision-driven storyline. Happily, that polish time has now come to an end, as the devs have today announced a fresh release date of April 10th.

                              <span>Welcome to the final part of Electric Nightmares, a short series about generative AI and games. So far we’ve seen the past, the present and the problems surrounding this new buzzword as it filters its way into our games and communities. In this final part of the series, I want to try and think concretely with you about what the future might hold; to go beyond what we think is just or legal, what we might be excited by or fearful of, and instead think about the practicalities of making and playing games today and how that might be impacted by generative AI&#x27;s growing dominance.

                              <span>No James this week, but I am joined by Nate for this week&#x27;s Electronic Wireless Show podcast to discuss Ubisoft&#x27;s new NEO NPC prototype - an NPC you can have a stilted, weird conversation with using the power of AI! It&#x27;s fair to say we are quite partisan about this and do not want it, but we discuss why anyway. In counterpoint, we think World Of Warcraft&#x27;s new piratey battle royale game mode sounds pretty cool and good, actually?
Plus: I ask Nate to explain cool things that I&#x27;ve seen in Warhammer 40K: Darktide, and Nate tries to convince me to take a devil&#x27;s bargain where I have to play WOW for at least 12 hours a day, but I get a sort of increasing MDMA high while doing so.

                              <span>Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I&#x27;ve been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold&#x27;s assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than &#x27;feed the fish&#x27; and &#x27;talk to so and so&#x27;, all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.
Rather, it&#x27;s Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He&#x27;s a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he&#x27;s some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn&#x27;t help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone&#x27;s underlying frustration with him like it&#x27;s all water off a duck&#x27;s back. It doesn&#x27;t seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he&#x27;s too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn&#x27;t nearly as pleasant. After all, it&#x27;s not just Harold that&#x27;s being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn&#x27;t just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it&#x27;s also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.

                              <span>I usually know right away when I&#x27;m going to enjoy interactive fiction. But I don&#x27;t always know why. Isle Of Maligree is a bit of an all-rounder, as pretty much every part of it is doing something right, but it&#x27;s the sense that you&#x27;re making your own version of its story that marks it out.
People are going missing on the island, and you&#x27;ve been sent to investigate. Only, it seems this isn&#x27;t the first time, because some sinister magic is causing everyone to forget the whole thing ever happened. If you don&#x27;t figure it out in time, you&#x27;ll have to make a new character and try again. And if you&#x27;re an amazing genius who figures it out on your first try... you&#x27;ll want to try again anyway, to play it a different way and see what you missed. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll even do it without getting stabbed.

First released in 2020, it&#x27;s a gauntlet of fantasy turn-based battles where most attacks, abilities, buffs, debuffs, and items are very cleverly handled by mapping them onto the faces of dice. Oh, you&#x27;re going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice &amp; Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.

Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&amp;B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who&#x27;s a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! 
Nancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It&#x27;s also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It&#x27;s a mixed bag, is what I&#x27;m saying.

                              <span>I’m not saying it’s some kind of electronic commerce conspiracy orchestrated by Big Graphics Card, but I’ve noticed that most of the best Amazon Spring sale deals on gaming monitors are for 4K screens. On the one hand, aww, because everyone likes a bargain 1440p-er. On the other, woo, because gaming-spec 4K monitors are usually some of the most financially devastating PC hardware pieces you can get. Anything that makes these super-sharp displays more affordable is, therefore, quite welcome. 160Hz, UHD visuals for £399? Sure, why not.

Riot co-founder Marc Merrill announced that the project has been &quot;reset&quot; and won&#x27;t appear for &quot;likely several years&quot;, with one of the main reasons being a &quot;need to do something that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre&quot;.

Powerful. May 9th is the day, so you have time to practise your touchtyping with Mavis Beacon. I really enjoyed playing Cryptmaster&#x27;s Steam Next Fest demo, so I&#x27;m excited for the full game.

There was no apology for the journalists accused of reporting &#x27;fake news&#x27;, or an apology for Cloudflare after disrupting its business. Meanwhile, Cloudflare will draw attention to overblocking by urging customers affected by the blunder to file official complaints.

While this isn&#x27;t gameplay footage of me playing the game, I did get a chance to play the game recently, so Marcus Stewart and I decided to get together and chat about his time playing the game.
Hyper Light Breaker is entering early access on PC some time this year. For more on my time playing the game, you can read my full Hyper Light Breaker preview here.

                              <span>Skydance New Media’s mysterious World War 2 Marvel game has a title: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. It also has its first trailer and a release window.
First announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other&#x27;s methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. 


Marvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. 
Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance&#x27;s story consultant, Marc Bernardin.</span>

Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it…</span>

                              <span>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero had a big coming out party in the form of a 13-minute gameplay presentation that gave fans a nice look at its moment-to-moment combat. Bandai Namco showed off what&#x27;s new, what&#x27;s staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. 
Naturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. 


The presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.
Dragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:
Broly (Super Saiyan Full Power)
Burter
Dyspo
Hit
Jeice
Kakunsa
Kale (Super Saiyan Berserk)
Master Roshi (Max Power)
Nappa
Super Trunks
Toppo

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>After its launch in 2007, the popularity of streaming links platform SeriesYonkis exploded and within a year it was among the most-visited sites in Spain. From a local law enforcement operation against one of the site&#x27;s operators in 2009, a full trial demanding 550 million euros from four men in 2019, to their complete acquittal in 2021, the journey was eventful. Yet suddenly, following an appeal by the movie companies&#x27; anti-piracy outfit, the case will be resurrected.

After Microsoft compared the lawsuit to the VCR scaremongering of the early 1980s, The Times stresses that generative AI is nothing like the VCR, before doubling down on its copyright infringement allegations.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard&#x27;s big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a &quot;massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,&quot; so if you&#x27;ve been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.
This month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they&#x27;ll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.
Here&#x27;s the rest of the line-up:

                              <span>Today, after months of rumors and speculation, LEGO (in partnership with Wizards of the Coast) revealed the first full look at the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed building set entitled Red Dragon’s Tale. The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.
Produced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&amp;D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.

Interestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&amp;D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&amp;D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&amp;D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.
In addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&amp;D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.

                              <span>The remake of the 1997 classic Riven is officially launching later this year. This modern facelift of the acclaimed sequel to Myst is also coming to VR.
Developed by Cyan Worlds, a team led by the masterminds of the original game, Riven is being remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. First announced in 2022, the game is promised to be a faithful homage that leverages modern tech to allow for immersive visuals, free movement, expanded storytelling, and new puzzles. Check out its latest teaser trailer below. 


Riven: The Sequel to Myst was first released in 1997 and has been hailed as a PC classic of the era. It&#x27;s so beloved that an existing fan-driven remake, The Starry Expanse Project, was already in the works when Cyan Worlds announced this remake. Recognizing their efforts, Cyan Worlds worked with The Starry Expanse to incorporate their efforts into this official remake. 
Outside of PC, it&#x27;s unclear which platforms, VR or otherwise, Riven will target. To keep up with similar projects, check out our Big List of Upcoming Video Game Remakes.</span>

The 1.6 Patch is now live, and it&#x27;s a doozy. If you want to read the patch notes in their entirety, which includes new content, balance updates, visual improvements, and more, you can do that right here.
The original story continues below...
Eight years after its official launch, Stardew Valley remains one of the most popular games on the market right now, which is no surprise; whether you&#x27;re marrying a neighbor, farming crops, or toiling away in the mines, it&#x27;s a game with something for everyone. Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end. That is, until today.

Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  
The game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”


In a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, 
“I&#x27;m so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can&#x27;t grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I&#x27;m so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”
Balatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.</span>

                              <span>Valve has announced Steam Families, a revamped program that allows players to create a group to share and play games with close family members. The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. 
Steam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member&#x27;s library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. 
Noteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy. You can read the full list here.

An entire generation of fighting game fans have been born, hit puberty, graduated college, found a career, and possibly started a family in the time between the last Fatal Fury game and the upcoming City of the Wolves. The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.
I had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya . Fatal Fury has been an arcade mai…</span>

                              <span>Animal Well, the gorgeous indie metroidvania that will also be the first game published by Videogamedunkey&#x27;s Bigmode, will hit PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this May. More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. 
Dunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory&#x27;s Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. 
Check out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: 


&quot;After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,&quot; Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). &quot;I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don&#x27;t really know what else to say.&quot; 
As you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you&#x27;re a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game&#x27;s metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there&#x27;s a dog, which rules. 
Animal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9.

                              <span>SNK has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming fighter, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, revealing it&#x27;s due out in &quot;early 2025&quot; as well. This trailer arrives roughly half a year after SNK formally revealed Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in a trailer similar to today&#x27;s, featuring Terry Bogard facing off against Rock Howard. 
That duo returns for another fight in the latest trailer, spotlighting the game&#x27;s new &quot;REV&quot; system that features Rev Guard, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and presumably more we&#x27;ll learn about when the game is released next year. 
Check it out for yourself in the new Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves gameplay trailer below: 


Unfortunately, the trailer doesn&#x27;t reveal anything else about the game, including platforms. Presumably, it will come to PlayStation and Xbox (possibly Switch), and PC. 
SNK will release Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in early 2025.
In the meantime, check out SNK&#x27;s original tease for the game from 2022, and then watch the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves reveal trailer from last year.

But just like waiting for a bus, suddenly two come along at once. The first aims to block Australians&#x27; view of more than 30 pirate sites, a disproportionate number serving the pirate anime market. A brand-new application sees Apple in a surprise partnership with Hollywood and Netflix, because everyone has exclusives to protect these days.

                              <span>Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 is right around the corner, launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next week on March 22. Ahead of the game&#x27;s launch, Capcom has released a new gameplay overview trailer with more than seven minutes of new footage; and perhaps strangely, it&#x27;s narrated by actor Ian McShane (Deadwood, John Wick, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). 
Broken up into three sections in the video, McShane discusses &quot;The Hero&quot; of Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2, the &quot;Two Nations,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The Monsters&quot; that players will be killing plenty of during their journey. 
Check it out for yourself in the Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 gameplay overview trailer below: 


Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 22, 2024. 
For more about the game, read Game Informer&#x27;s hands-on Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 preview, and then check out this story about how Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2&#x27;s main story campaign is about the same length as the first game. After that, read about how Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has an uncapped framerate but no visual presets or modes on consoles, and then check out this story about why Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2 has just one save file.

                              <span>Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II is right around the corner, hitting Xbox Series X/S exclusively on May 21, and ahead of the game&#x27;s release, Ninja Theory has revealed it will have a dedicated photo mode. Plus, the studio released four new images of Hellblade II taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode. 
While in-game photo modes are becoming the norm more and more with each new release, there are still some games that launch without one. With how good Hellblade II continues to look in trailers and screenshots, it&#x27;s great to hear the game will feature this mode. 
Check out the four new Hellblade II images taken using the game&#x27;s photo mode for yourself below: 

Based on the tweet revealing the photo mode, it sounds like players can expect it to launch with the game. 
&quot;Photo mode returns in Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II,&quot; a Ninja Theory tweet reads. &quot;Here are some shot we took purely using photo mode in-game this week.&quot; 
Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S on May 21, 2024. 
For more about the game, watch the latest Senua&#x27;s Saga: Hellblade II trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from December. After that, watch this other gameplay trailer for another look at the game&#x27;s action.

Last month, we learned that Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, was reportedly set to sell Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake developer Saber Interactive.

Now, it&#x27;s official: Embracer has sold off Saber Interactive to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. Beacon Interactive is controlled by Saber Interactive co-founder Matthew Karch, the publication reports.

                              <span>For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.
The program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.
Like last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.
ScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.
We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.
Based on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

                              <span>If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.</span>
