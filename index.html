Fortunately, a new video by YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits has decided to take a closer look at the game. So, what are the results? In docked mode, the game runs at 30fps with a resolution of 900p. As for handheld, Sparks of Hope runs at a relatively consistent 30fps and a resolution of about 612p.

Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York.

Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

                              <span>Collectible card game Marvel Snap has been released into early access on Steam as a free to play download. Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

This time around, you’ll be able to ride around a Wild West town pretending to be sheriff, although you seem to own a micro scooter instead of a horse for some reason. You can see more of what’s in store for the green detective by watching the trailer below.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

                              <span>I loved Overwatch when it first came out. When the original game was fresh and new, I was experimenting with the characters just like everyone else. I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

I first reported on this free pumpkin carving game from Adamgryu (of A Short Hike fame) way back in 2020, when it was only the 999th festival, and Alice0 took a stroll around it last year, too.
This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

The event will be performed by a group of musicians led by award winner Kenny Garrett and upcomer Takuya Kuroda, so it&#x27;s safe to assume the cats will really be cookin&#x27; out there.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023. If you want to sign up for more updates, you can visit their website here. If you’re hungry for more Mortal Kombat, check out this trailer celebrating its 30th anniversary.</span>

When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

                              <span>Elden Ring&#x27;s music like you&#x27;ve never heard it before
Elden Ring was far and away one of the biggest games of 2022, and is one of the frontrunners for Game of the Year. Every aspect of the game is incredibly well-thought out, from the art to the gameplay to the enemies. Bandai Namco, however, seems especially proud of the music from Elden Ring, because they&#x27;re hosting a special jazz concert to showcase some of the most popular songs and &quot;recognizable melodies from the game&#x27;s soundtrack.
The event is called Elden Ring: A Night In The Lands Between, and will be for one night only on December 3 at The Bourbon Room in Los Angeles. The iconic melodies will be performed by musicians led by award-winning saxophonist Kenny Garrett, as well as jazz upcomer and trumpeter Takuya Kuroda. Tickets are on sale now for the in-person event, ranging anywhere from $75, known as the &quot;Tarnished&quot; tier, to the $200 &quot;Elden Lord tier that also gets you a poster, a t-shirt, dinner, and VIP seating. If you&#x27;re unable to make it, you can also get access to a livestream of the event for $25, or to a VOD available after the concert for $15 -- the catch is that the stream is only available to fans in the United States.

It seems that video game concerts are becoming more and more popular these days, and as a fan of live music, I hope they keep it up. Playing games can be something of an isolating hobby, so the idea of getting out and appreciating music we know and love played by insanely talented musicians is absolutely an idea I can get behind. Given that Elden Ring&#x27;s soundtrack is so orchestral, I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it would sound like with a jazz spin as well. Here&#x27;s hoping that game studios keep up the live music thing in the future, because making live music a more accessible activity is a win for everyone.

                              <span>Players will be able to go solo or collaborate
Electronic Arts and Maxis are working on the next generation of The Sims. Currently dubbed &quot;Project Rene&quot;, the next entry in The Sims franchise is confirmed to be in early development.
As shown during today&#x27;s Behind The Sims Summit stream, Maxis is currently in &quot;very early&quot; stages of creating the next Sims game. The project title, Rene, was chosen to represent the team&#x27;s &quot;renewed commitment&quot; for a bright Sims future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Tmm6h6bHD3o
We see some experimentation the team has been working on with its creative tools, for building and decorating specifically. There&#x27;s the ability to change patterns, colors, and shapes as players decorate and build in-game.

Collaboration seems to be a big focal point for this new Sims. Players will be able to play solo or collaborate with each other, and will be able to play across supported supported devices.
No more information was given, as it sounds like Project Rene is still a ways out. Maxis says it will continue to share more information on development as it goes along.
A new world of Sims
As for currently available Sims products, today marks the launch of The Sims 4 base game as a free-to-play title. Players can now jump in on PC, Mac, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;xIBBm7tWs_U
More is in store, too. Maxis says it&#x27;s still adding new content, in the forms of packs, kits, free updates, and Sims Delivery Express drops, for the forseeable future. Some early expansion content was also teased in today&#x27;s stream, and the team confirms that infants will be arriving in early 2023.
The Sims is also partnering with Overwolf for an official mod destination in CurseForge. Modders will not be required to move over to or use CurseForge, but it&#x27;s meant to provide a &quot;supplementary experience&quot; to existing avenues for modding. It also provides a moderated mod platform.

When you next get involved in a street fight — as we all do — you might want to ensure that you&#x27;re dressed for success, (or at least to impress), by donning one of these full-print Street Fighter bomber jackets, now available to order from merchandiser NERDS Clothing.
Officially produced in collaboration with Capcom, the powerfully colored jackets are styled after several members of the Street Fighter roster, with variants for legendary World Warriors Ryu, Chun-Li, Bison, Cammy, and new boy Luke. Each jacket features a color scheme typified by the character, with a full backprint showcasing the fighter in action. Somewhat anachronistically, the jackets are also emblazoned with an embroidered Street Fighter V logo, right on the cusp of Street Fighter 6&#x27;s vaunted release.

I&#x27;m obviously a dedicated and dyed-in-the-wool Street Fighter disciple, but it&#x27;s not in my build or age range to rock one of these bad boys.  Perhaps, however, they are more in keeping with your own sense of style and fashion.  If so, then you can check out the entire range over on the official NERDS Clothing website, where the jackets are available to order for $125 USD each (not including shipping costs).
(Edit: Since this article was published, all jackets — along with a range of new shirts — have suddenly been listed as being &quot;sold out&quot;.  This is a little curious, given that they haven&#x27;t even been available for a day, and the entire stock, in all eight sizes, has seemingly cleared out. I have reached out to the company for clarity.)
Street Fighter V is available now on PlayStation and PC. Street Fighter 6 will launch in 2023 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

Tunic fans can visit the Fangamer store today to pick up this very cheerful shirt, emblazoned with new artwork of our foxy hero and their myriad enemies.  Designed by artist Jorge M. Velez, the new shirt comes in women&#x27;s and unisex styles, and features a suitable &quot;leafy-green&quot; color palette. Additionally, a trio of additional clothing items — including another T-shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, and a zip-up jacket — are all currently in the works, and will form a line known as the &quot;Sacred Geometry&quot; collection.

Final Fantasy XIV received patch 6.25 today, which adds a surprising amount of content to dig into on the MMO&#x27;s peripheries.
The variant and criterion dungeons make their debut in patch 6.25. These activities offer both new challenges and rewards for players, as well as a deeper dive into the lore behind one of Final Fantasy XIV&#x27;s starting areas, Ul&#x27;dah.
Variants and criteria
You can start the quest chain in Old Sharlayan, by starting the Keys to the Past line by the docks. I won&#x27;t go into too much detail on where it goes from there, but longtime players will likely be pleased to see a certain character take the focus on this adventure.

I recently went on a little book-buying bonanza, readying my little library for the cold autumn and winter nights that’ll soon be coming to my wee corner of the world. Most of my purchases were novels designed to make me look intelligent and well-informed when guests see them on my shelves. But one was a pure nostalgia purchase. Earlier this year, Abrams Books released a compendium of The Uncanny X-Men trading cards that were illustrated by Jim Lee. These cards were a massive part of my childhood. I used to have an incredibly thick binder that had hundreds of these cards in it, and every once in a while, I would thumb through its pages, gawking at my collection.
While sentimental, the book’s decision to limit one side of one card per page makes it a rather annoying…</span>

Square Enix has released a slew of exciting new details pertaining to the upcoming DLC for Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin — The &quot;Wanderer of The Rift&quot; expansion will bring with it new dungeons to explore, new tools to master, and, the lord of chaos themselves, the fearsome warrior Gilgamesh.
Arriving October 26, The Wanderer of The Rift DLC will see the gargantuan and proud fighter introduce themselves to our team of heroes, bedecked in glorious kabuki battle armor and most certainly up for the rumble.  Gilgamesh is equipped with a variety of devastating weaponry — including spears, swords, and axes — and, as one who has harnessed space and time, will make for an unpredictable and challenging opponent.  As to their intentions in the wor…</span>

Xbox is lining up its later Game Pass additions for October, and it&#x27;s an interesting mix. There are some scares, some mysteries, and one big RPG that can easily take your time.
Persona 5 Royal is one of the big additions for this month on Xbox Game Pass. It hits cloud, console, and PC on October 21, bringing the previously PlayStation-exclusive RPG to new platforms.
Worth noting that Royal also hits PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, as well as Steam, on October 21.

If you&#x27;re looking for frights though, might I suggest the Amnesia games and, especially, Soma? All arrive on Game Pass this month, and SOMA is one story I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to dislodge from my head anytime soon.

I’ve been a massive fan of Ghostbusters for almost as long as I can remember. That means I’m insufferably picky. I haven’t even watched the 2016 reboot or Ghostbusters: Afterlife. It’s already been proven you can’t top the majesty of the original film. Video games are similar. Most games made off the license are okay at best and abysmal at worst.
When Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed was announced, I was skeptical. I’m not typically drawn to multi-player-focused games, and anyone who touches my beloved had better have immaculate hands. This time, it’s Illfonic, makers of the Friday the 13th game. They’ve proven themselves before, even if it was sort of overshadowed by Dead by Daylight. So, as I fastened up my positron collider, I kept a stance of cautiously optimistic mixed …</span>

Sony Interactive Entertainment has finally released details on its upcoming pro controller DualSense Edge — The top-tier tech will launch for the PlayStation 5 platform in January 2023, priced at $199.99 USD.  Pre-orders will open exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store from October 25.
The DualSense Edge Wireless Controller is set to be Sony&#x27;s premier controller for the PlayStation enthusiast. The new pad features a wide variety of customizable components and redefinable functions, ranging from trigger stop guards and replaceable thumbstick modules to programmable buttons, and save states for custom game layouts, alongside adjustable &quot;dead zones&quot; and trigger pressure.
You can check out the DualSense Edge&#x27;s features in the trailer below.

Alongside its swappable thumb grips, modules, and triggers, the DualSense Edge will also feature a tough, braided USB cord complete with lock, to prevent those accidental disconnects.  The controller sports advanced Haptic Feedback technology as well as built-in audio controls for headphones and the onboard speaker.  In addition, the Edge&#x27;s sleek carry case will also double as a charging dock (though it must remain wired in order to charge the controller.  It is not a battery backup device.)
The Sony DualSense Edge Wireless Controller will launch January 2023 at a retail price of $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the price of the PS5 digital console itself. However, for those who take their control methods very, very seriously and their wallet very, very lightly, this affluent technology will be the most mechanically precise Sony gamepad available.
Pre-orders for the DualSense Edge Wireless Controller go live October 25 exclusively on PlayStation Direct.

                              <span>Hey, it&#x27;s that dawg...
Capcom has announced that it will be hosting a brand new Resident Evil Showcase presentation later this week, complete with new trailers, updates, and details regarding its upcoming releases as they pertain to the iconic survival horror franchise.
Specifically, the broadcast will feature new footage and news surrounding both the upcoming Resident Evil Village: Gold Edition, the Winters Expansion DLC, and the highly anticipated remake of franchise favorite Resident Evil 4.  So anybody with a knack for battling either giant vampiric countesses or diminutive Napoleonic cult leaders will most certainly want to tune in and get up to speed on the ghoulish goings-on. With only 10 days to go until Gold Edition&#x27;s launch, it&#x27;s a fine time for it.
https://youtu.be/3Ss4_4bZhQI
The Resident Evil Showcase will take place Thursday, October 20 at 15:00 PT / 18:00 ET / 23:00 BST and can be viewed on the official Capcom/Resident Evil YouTube and Twitch channels, as well as their respective social media platforms.  While the length of the broadcast was not revealed, Capcom rarely tends to stray beyond the 30-minute mark for their presentations. God forbid everybody tried that.
Resident Evil Village: Gold Edition launches October 28 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Xbox department among those affected
According to a report from Business Insider, Microsoft has made major layoffs across its entire company, with many &quot;hundreds&quot; of employees from many different departments finding themselves out of work.
Several teams within Microsoft have been hit with major cuts, with some divisions and subsidiaries — such as war sim developer Studio Alpha — forced to close entirely.  The cuts have reportedly affected a wide variety of in-house departments, from Microsoft&#x27;s space technology division to its premier gaming platform, Xbox.  While the exact number of layoffs is unknown, Business Insider suggests it is in the region of hundreds but is overall less than 1000.
&quot;Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly,&quot; a Microsoft spokesperson in comments to Eurogamer. &quot;We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.&quot;
As all global industries adjust to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, slowed production, reduced consumer spending, and a steadily increasing cost of living crisis, even some of the world&#x27;s biggest and most successful companies seem to be tightening purse strings at best, and making sweeping staff cuts at worst.  As always, it is the &quot;little people&quot; that feel the hardest impact, forced out of work at a time of complete economic uncertainty, in a working world for which fragility has become a universal concern.

I like upgrades. I like definitive editions. When something I already enjoy looks better than it did the last time I played it? I like that. While the current generation edition of Persona 5 Royal is a boon for anyone who never owned a PlayStation 4, it&#x27;s hard to even refer to it as an upgrade for people who did.
If you already dug into the details of this new version, you might be wondering why we’re here. Why couldn’t this be a PS5 upgrade patch? Having spent some time with this new version and done my duty of squinting at finer details, I can tell you definitively: I have no idea.

The sales pitch
I chose to look at the PlayStation 5 version since I could easily just pop in the PlayStation 4 version to scrutinize for differences. Would people on PC an…</span>

                              <span>Unsure if the servers can also escape capitalism by going into space
Several EA games are due to have their servers shut down in the coming weeks.
As spotted by TrueAchievements, several Electronic Arts games are currently on track to have their servers shut down. Mirror&#x27;s Edge, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, Gatling Gears, and Shank 2 are all due to close servers at the start of the new year. The games were recently added to the EA site tracking servers due for updates or closure.
As detailed on EA&#x27;s site for service updates, games may still be playable offline.
TrueAchievements notes that two achievements in one of the affected games, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, do require online play. So you may want to get working on those now if you still want to pick them up. Others, like Mirror&#x27;s Edge, aren&#x27;t really affected by the closure.
Though if you&#x27;re looking to play some online Command &amp; Conquer, be aware that Red Alert 3 and C&amp;C3 servers are also due to close in November. They may go down, but Tim Curry&#x27;s performance in RA3 will live on forever.

EA&#x27;s site also details service updates, too. A prime example is The Sims 4, which is shifting over to a free-to-play version on October 18.
Here&#x27;s the full list of upcoming closures and when they&#x27;re happening.

In case you missed it, there&#x27;s been a whole lot of controversy this week surrounding the upcoming release of Bayonetta 3 this week.  The original Bayonetta voice actress, Hellena Taylor, who has voiced Cereza in both of the mainline games and the spin-offs, took to Twitter this week to ask players to boycott the series&#x27; third entry.  While the game&#x27;s director, Yusuke Miyata, stated that &quot;various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,&quot; Taylor says that she turned down the role because she was offered a mere $4,000 in payment for her potential voice work on Bayonetta 3, which is negligible compared to the value she has brought to the series.  Instead, prolific voice actress Jennifer Hale, known for roles li…</span>

Tato naléhavá výzva k přijetí opatření byla motivována současnou geopolitickou situací, škodlivou povahou útoků na dodavatelské řetězce a stále rostoucí závislostí naší společnosti na digitálních technologiích. Výzva se zaměřuje na posílení bezpečnosti dodavatelského řetězce IKT a je rovněž prvním krokem k řešení hrozeb nežádoucí strategické závislosti v rámci dodavatelských řetězců IKT.</span>

                              <span>New report says &quot;Taylor asked for a six-figure sum&quot;.
Over the weekend, a series of videos posted by former Bayonetta voice actor Hellena Taylor accused developer PlatinumGames of offering an &quot;insulting&quot; sum of $4,000USD to reprise the role in the upcoming third entry, Bayonetta 3, although a new Bloomberg report (paywall) features claims from sources &quot;familiar with the negotiations&quot; which paint a slightly different picture.
As reported by Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, two sources — who requested to remain anonymous, though whose claims are supported by documentation seen by both Bloomberg and VGC — say that PlatinumGames was &quot;determined&quot; to have Taylor reprise the role, and wanted to secure Taylor for &quot;at least five sessions, each paying $3,000 to $4,000 for four hours in the studio,&quot; putting the total payment for the role at a minimum of $15,000.

Video games based on the Dragon Ball franchise usually have a very specific focus. While there have been the occasional RPGs like Kakarot or The Legacy of Goku thrown into the mix, most have been firmly focused on fighting your way across the series’ story. However, Dragon Ball: The Breakers has the guts to do something completely different. It doesn’t always hit the right notes but it is unique enough that fans of the anime and manga will be thrilled for at least several hours
Instead of battling it out against some of the most iconic villains in anime history, you are given a taste of how nightmarish it would be to live as a normal person in the Dragon Ball universe. This is an asymmetrical 7v1 survival game remarkably similar to the likes of Dead by Daylight or Friday the 13th: The Game. In fact, there is very little in The Breakers that tries to change or advance the formula presented in these titles other than offering a more colourful aesthetic and cartoonish atmosphere.

Halo Infinite&#x27;s Forge Mode leaked earlier this year ahead of its 8th November beta release date, and for months now, players have been expressing their creativity by creating a plethora of unusual maps in Microsoft&#x27;s premier first-person shooter games. One popular map builder, Red Nomster, has created a map that may well lead to the ultimate crossover — a recreation of Kokiri Forest from Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
Spotted by Eurogamer, Red Nomster has been creating unusual maps in Infinite&#x27;s leaked Forge Mode for a while — from Toy Story to some incredible underwater stages — and Kokiri Forest is yet another demonstration of his talents. It&#x27;s not just an accurate recreation of the location from the N64 classic, it&#x27;s also an attempt at translating Zelda&#x27;s puzzle mechanics into Halo.

As far as projects in the Jurassic Park Universe (JPU? Does anyone say that?) goes, the four month period between the latest film and the announcement of what&#x27;s to come next is a pretty long time. Fortunately, Coatsink is here to put our minds at ease, as it has today announced that its upcoming dino title, Jurassic World Aftermath Collection, will be roaring onto Switch on November 10th.
Fans of the JPU (yes, we&#x27;re pushing this one) might recognise the Aftermath name as the series of two VR survival games from the prehistoric year of 2020. Well, as the game&#x27;s title suggests, Aftermath Collection will see these two games brought together and reworked specifically for the Nintendo Switch.

                              <span>&quot;Aero GPX belongs on the Switch&quot;.
We desperately want to see Captain Falcon and the F-Zero franchise return to our screens — the game&#x27;s appearance in Smash Bros. just isn&#x27;t enough! Luckily, there are some fantastic indie games out there that look to recapture the spirit of the anti-gravity racing series. And Aero GPX might just be the best example we&#x27;ve ever seen.
This PC-bound racer&#x27;s Kickstarter launched today and has been developed by one person — Aaron McDevitt. The game is primarily inspired by F-Zero X and F-Zero GX, but McDevitt also took a shine to Wave Race 64 and Kirby Air Ride, wrapping Wave Race&#x27;s summer vibes and Kirby&#x27;s pick-up-and-play nature in some hardcore, fast-paced racing.

Ahh, Mario Party. The destroyer of friendships. The ice-breaker. The game you get out every holiday season, lose at, only to hide it away for another 365 days but hold a grudge for a lifetime.
The Mario Party series has been going since 1998 on the Nintendo 64, causing family squabbles and fabled rivalries ever since. And, with the sobering news that Mario Party 4 — the series&#x27; first GameCube entry — is 20 years old on 21st October 2022, we thought there&#x27;s no better way of celebrating than a community game of Bumper Balls! Or, wait, sorry... a community poll!

Clive &#x27;N&#x27; Wrench is a name we&#x27;ve been reporting on since the Wii U days — which, believe it or not, is a long time ago! It&#x27;s been in development for 12 years, even. But publisher Numskull Games has revealed that the wait won&#x27;t be much longer, as the 3D platformer will be launching in February 2023.
Starring Clive, the rabbit and Wrench, the monkey, this &#x27;90s-inspired platformer is the creation of Rob Wass, a map designer who&#x27;s worked on Unreal Tournament and Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, and San Andreas. This is definitely a bit of a switch-up, with Medieval towns and desert vistas among a few levels you&#x27;ll get to explore. All inside a magical 1950&#x27;s refrigerator...?

Digimon fans won&#x27;t have to wait long for a brand new Digimon game on Switch. Bandai Namco has announced in the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu that it will be bringing Digimon World: Next Order International Edition to the console on 22nd February 2023 in Japan. A Western release date hasn&#x27;t been announced yet.

Splatoon 3 just continues to splatter ink over all sorts of records, especially in Japan where the IP is huge. And it&#x27;s just surpassed another one — with the release of the Japan Monthly Report for September 2022, it&#x27;s now been confirmed that Splatoon 3 is the best-selling video game in Japan in 2022.
The data from the report was shared by Game Data Library on Twitter, and it reveals that Nintendo&#x27;s third ink-based shooter sold just over 2.9 million retail units in the month of September alone. That means, in just a month, it&#x27;s surpassed Pokémon Legends: Arceus&#x27; 2.295 million retail unit sales.

The craze now coined as “bronyism” — a heavily documented My Little Pony fandom that took root in 2010 — turned out to be more about inclusion than it did the show (Friendship is Magic) itself. Despite our attempts to get into it based on recommendations, we found its adult appeal largely overvalued. It acted as a conduit for individuals to share and be part of something, and every Brony surely knows, deep down, that the primary attraction is its related community. However, it turned out to be just the beginning of the next decade of media output and social-political causes that operated on a similar set of principles.
Twelve years on, and the fandom isn’t ready to quit just yet. Them’s Fightin’ Herds isn’t a licensed product and doesn’t feature a single character from the show, but its art style, themes and execution are so perfectly accurate to its influence that it takes scrutiny to realise it’s not an official Hasbro product. Obviously, the horse in the room here is that Lauren Faust, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic’s creator, rendered the game’s cast of characters, making it feel totally authentic.

If all of the outstanding reviews for Persona 5 Royal on the Nintendo Switch aren&#x27;t already convincing enough, we&#x27;ve also got a side-by-side comparison video to prove just how spectacular this particular version of the game is.
The comparison clip, courtesy of YouTube channel GameXplain - shows the Nintendo Switch version alongside the PlayStation 4 release. This includes a number of cinematic segments as well as some of the gameplay. Take at both versions in the video:

Today marks the release of A Plague Tale: Requiem across multiple platforms. Like the original rat-filled adventure A Plague Tale: Innocence, this is another cloud release on the Nintendo Switch.
Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not just a rental offer, either. If you want to play through the full game on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system you&#x27;ll need to fork out $59.99 USD or your regional equivalent. In terms of the installation, you will have to first install the app, which takes up around 59MB of space, and then test out the experience.

Not long after Nintendo released an update for Nintendo Switch Sports last week, it was required to temporarily suspend the rollout due to a bug causing game crashes. It more recently said it would be issuing two updates to resolve this issue, and the first one has now officially gone live.
This new update, which is essentially just a fix, bumps the game up to Version 1.2.2. Once players have installed this update, they should be able to access online play once again. Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo&#x27;s official support page:

PlatinumGames revealed earlier this month the prolific voice actor Jennifer Hale would be replacing Hellena Taylor as the voice of Bayonetta in the upcoming Switch exclusive, Bayonetta 3.
Following the weekend drama, Hale has now issued her own statement - mentioning how she&#x27;s not really at liberty to speak about the entire situation regarding Bayonetta 3 as she&#x27;s currently under a non-disclosure agreement. Here&#x27;s the message in full (via social media):

                              <span>Lemme tell you something
I often opine that video games have not been very good to Ghostbusters. I would think that the entrepreneurial attitude of the original movie depicting a very chaotic and game-like profession would be ripe for translation, but most titles that approach the subject matter fumble it. Sometimes they fumble it catastrophically. Ghostbusters on the NES is among the worst games I’ve ever played.
The go-to answer for a Ghostbusters game done right is Ghostbusters: The Video Game, and it’s absolutely a decent effort. However, despite getting together the original cast and sticking pretty faithfully to the license, the narrative felt tonally off, and the gameplay was merely middling.
If you want the game that really deserves to be considered the best title wearing the tan f…</span>

If I know anything about gamers, it&#x27;s that we love to show our love of gaming to others, and what better way to do that than to wear your favorite game right on your clothing?  If you happen to love Horizon: Forbidden West in particular, you&#x27;re really in luck, because Guerrilla has teamed up with ASOS to create a brand new line of loungewear inspired by the game.  The various shirts, hoodies, and pants all feature bright prints with various iconography from Forbidden West, and they&#x27;re the perfect statement piece for the fashionable gamers out there.
There are five different looks in total, including an all-over printed hoodie and jogger set, a long-sleeved mesh top, an over-sized printed t-shirt, a crewneck hoodie, and a brown co-ord hoodie and jogger set.  All of the pieces are unisex, which means anybody can achieve the cool, oversized loungewear look.  My personal favorite is the crewneck hoodie, which features comic panels inspired by Horizon: Forbidden West.  The all-over prints are a bit busy for my taste, but I would for sure get cozy in that brown set any day of the week.

The pieces range from £26 for the shirts to £76 for the co-ord set, but overall I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty affordable for this kind of product. I guess it is ASOS, after all.  Unfortunately, the Horizon x ASOS collab is only available to those in the EU, UK, Japan, and Asia regions, but for everyone else, I would put money down on people listing these on eBay (for a higher price, but still).  At the very least, it&#x27;s nice to look, and we can hope that they&#x27;ll ship to the US in the future.
You know what awesome gaming clothing store does ship out here, though?  Insert Coin Clothing.  They&#x27;ve been a staple for gaming clothing for years, and their stuff is always amazing quality.

                              <span>The lead is leaving after over 11 years at the company
The director behind the upcoming Splinter Cell remake is leaving Ubisoft.
David Grivel announced his departure on LinkedIn, as spotted by VGC. Grivel started out at Ubisoft Paris working on Ghost Recon: Future Soldier before moving to Toronto&#x27;s office. There, he worked on games including Splinter Cell Blacklist, the Far Cry series, and eventually the remake of Splinter Cell.
&quot;After more than 11 years at Ubisoft, it is now time for me to go on a new adventure,&quot; Grivel wrote on his LinkedIn page. &quot;11 years is a long time and summing it up in one post is quasi-impossible but I must say, I’ve been lucky. Lucky to work with so many great people over the years. Made so many friends.&quot;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HH1_ZCSf_HY
While he&#x27;s leaving the studio, it sounds like Grivel is not leaving the games industry. The now-former director says to &quot;stay tuned&quot; for what is next for him.
Chaos theory
With its director departing, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what Ubisoft is up to with the new take on Splinter Cell. The company has reportedly seen above-average turnover, some of which has been attributed to the reported-on studio culture at Ubisoft.
The Splinter Cell remake has quietly been in development at Ubisoft Toronto. Though we&#x27;ve only seen confirmation and a short teaser for it, we&#x27;ve heard a few details.
This includes that the new take on Sam Fisher&#x27;s story won&#x27;t be open world. And it will re-tackle the story for a &quot;modern-day audience&quot; as well. No release date has been set for the project.

Asked about &quot;horror games&quot;, a genre that has come into its own over the past two decades, many players will distinctly think of the visceral, the grotesque, and the physically unfathomable.  These terrors can arrive in the form of mushroom-headed mutants, giant, overhead spiders, or hideous, skinless, black-eyed zombies, ready to pop up directly into your PoV with a ghastly scream in what we have coined the &quot;jump scare&quot;.
Boo.
But, even within scenarios set outside of our own sphere of time or reality, horror can strike much closer to home.  It can be presented in its purest form, via themes of grief, regret, responsibility, and, scariest of all, the loss of one&#x27;s own capabilities, focus, and mind.  I&#x27;ve never encountered a mushroom-headed mutant, but I&#x27;ve been comple…</span>

Japanese studio Aniplex has released a lightning-fast teaser trailer for its upcoming anime NieR: Automata Ver1.1a, an animated series set within PlatinumGames/Square Enix dystopian sci-fi universe.
Titled &quot;Promotion File 003: Bunker&quot;, the brief preview introduces us to the incredibly stern and authoritative voice of Commander White, portrayed by veteran voice actor Chiaki Kanou.  Barking out commands while threateningly tapping a crop of some kind, Commander White is seemingly in charge of a battalion of YoRHa-esque battle bots, who will no doubt be charged with taking the fight to the army of metal monstrosities — The Machines — currently laying siege to planet Earth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9p26isMDvuM
In addition to the blink-and-you&#x27;ll-miss-it clip, Aniplex released a promotional image, depicting Commander White alongside several members of their regiment. It looks like we&#x27;re going to have to wait a little longer for full details on the anime&#x27;s narrative and cast, but it&#x27;s clear that NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is more of an adaptation of the NieR universe and its interplanetary warfare in general, rather than a direct retelling of the events depicted in Platinum&#x27;s smash-selling video game series.
NieR: Automata Ver1.1a will premiere in Japan in early 2023.  NieR: Automata is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. A long-awaited Nintendo Switch port, known as &quot;The End of YoRHa Edition&quot; was released worldwide on October 6.  You can check out Jonathan Holmes thoughts on the release right here.

                              <span>Mario, Rabbids, and tactics mix well once again
The first Mario + Rabbids crossover was an interesting, surprising mix of ideas that you wouldn&#x27;t presume would work together. But while Kingdom Battle laid out the groundwork, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope feels like it&#x27;s expanding the ideas and making something a bit more its own. And it&#x27;s all the better for it.
It doesn&#x27;t take long to get into the actual battles in Sparks of Hope. While the crew is lounging about at Peach&#x27;s Castle, they&#x27;re suddenly thrust into an interstellar conflict. The evil Cursa is vying for control of the galaxy. Meanwhile, Lumas are being turned Rabbid, making them into Sparks that need Mario and crew&#x27;s help.
Mario, Luigi, and Peach all rejoin the starting roster, alongside their Rabbid counterparts. Down the line,…</span>

                              <span>It better have a &#x27;Sonic Sez&#x27; segment
We are only a few short weeks away from the return of an icon, as Sonic Frontiers prepares for its November debut on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms — And while fans wait for The Blue Blur to return, Sega hopes to perform some important scene-setting via a narrative prologue, to be delivered in both comic-book and animation form.

As revealed on the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter, Sega is preparing to drop a two-part digital comic, that will offer up a little backstory on the events that preceded Sonic finding himself isolated in a strange, eerie, and monolithic new world.  Sonic the Hedgehog: Convergence is written by frequent Sonic scribe Ian Flynn — with characterful artwork by Evan Stanley &amp; Heather Breckel — and will no doubt provide suitable reading to get series&#x27; fans hype fires burning brightly before the game&#x27;s big launch.
While no further information was offered, Sega did announce that an animated short is also in the works, which will again help lay the groundwork for the new adventure.  Sega has utilized animation frequently in its marketing of Sonic the Hedgehog titles.  And usually to very good effect, as the world of Sonic and his anthro pals always lends itself very well to the medium of animation — perhaps better than any other gaming franchise.  We&#x27;ll be sure to give you a heads-up when the Sonic Frontiers comic and animated short are available.
Sonic Frontiers launches November 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

                              <span>Time to strike
First-person shooters splintered near the turn of the millennium. Goldeneye 007, Half-Life, and Halo all had massive impacts on the genre, and their formulas would be the ones imitated for years after. The old key-hunt style of shooter practically died off, only to be revived recently. Now, the indie shooter marketplace is flooded with homages to the pre-3D accelerated years of gaming.
It’s the best time ever to start reassessing games that may have been overlooked. When it comes to leaving no stone unturned, Chasm: The Rift is one of the rockiest. Released in 1997 by Ukrainian developer Action Forms, it wasn’t one I was familiar with. As I looked into it, I saw it referred to as “poor man’s Quake” and “Eurojank.” Yet, those almost seem like terms of endearment, as it does h…</span>

                              <span>Well, I&#x27;ll be Damned
A brief video posted to the Twitter of developer Grasshopper Manufacture has got fans wondering whether a new, horror-themed title is currently in the works at the No More Heroes studio.  The clip sees a developer hard at work designing a grotesque monster described as an &quot;enemy boss&quot; character.
The &quot;Cultboss&quot; creature — an amalgamation of twisted meat and skulls — looks particularly hellish, which has fans speculating as to whether a new Shadows of the Damned game is in development. Amusingly, asked about their thought process in drawing a 2D image from a completed 3D model, the developer candidly admits that they have &quot;No idea&quot; as they have &quot;never done it before&quot;.
https://twitter.com/Grasshopper_EN/status/1581660988910161921?s&#x3D;20&amp;t&#x3D;71a7YnTWo3TPJdFznjwUiA
The video itself is a teaser for Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s media output, which includes its &quot;Dev room shorts&quot; videos, in-house documentaries, podcasts, and other behind-the-scenes content. At some point today/tomorrow, the studio will release a brand new interview with its irrepressible founder Goichi Suda — better known to video game fans by his moniker Suda51.  The interview will see the eccentric game designer reflect on titles such as The Silver Case, No More Heroes, and the studio itself.
&quot;WATCH OR DIE!&quot; demands the commercial.  Gee, I guess we better all tune in.
As for the origins of this mysterious monster... I guess we&#x27;re just going to have to wait and see.

It appears that, right off of the bat, Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s decision to go free-to-play with its hero shooter sequel Overwatch 2 has the required effect — The studio has announced that the charismatic multiplayer title has already rocketed past 25 million players in its first 10 days of release.
The number far supersedes that of the original 2016 premium title, which hit around 15 million players during its early launch months.  Blizzard has also noted that daily player counts are already tripling those of the original Overwatch by almost 300%, though what percentage of these players are Reaper mains was not offered up at this time.

                              <span>Straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth
Since the premature death of Silent Hills and the P.T. demo, we&#x27;ve seen a constant stream of supposed leaks and rumors about what will be the next Silent Hill game.  Plenty of people claim to have inside information, but this Wednesday, we&#x27;ll hear it directly from the people who actually run the show.  Konami dropped word on Sunday that a Silent Hill Transmission will broadcast on October 19 and will feature &quot;the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot;
https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1581754864702398464
It&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess what we&#x27;ll see in the show, but I&#x27;d put my money on Konami pulling back the curtain on that recently uncovered Silent Hill: The Short Message product listing.  Could The Short Message be a new game or a remake of one of the previous games in the series?  Is it that Abandoned game we&#x27;ve all stopped making fun of?  I used the Silent Hill: Shattered Memories key art in the banner image because Sam Barlow mentioned a follow-up to that masterpiece in the past.  And Masahiro Ito seems to be aware of it.  I guess as long as Konami isn&#x27;t revealing a new pachinko machine, it should be worth tuning in for.
The Silent Hill franchise has been in purgatory for about a decade following the release of Downpour and Book of Memories in 2012.  Hideo Kojima famously tried to take the reigns of the franchise in 2014 with Silent Hills, but following a well-publicized fallout with Konami, he left the company and the project behind to form his own studio.  There have been many rumors of Kojima creating a Silent Hill game over at Kojima Productions, but there&#x27;s not been anything concrete on that front.
Whatever it is, fans won&#x27;t have to wait long. The Silent Hill Transmission is set for October 19 at 2:00 pm Pacific.

While many pseudonymous defendants are yet to be identified, information provided by the owner of Elite Boss Tech has allowed Bungie to identify and serve two men in Europe. One has agreed to cooperate.

You&#x27;ll no doubt have seen your social feeds ablaze with controversy around Bayonetta 3 this weekend, with specific debate over the value of voice actors and their work in video games and beyond. To many gamers and assorted onlookers, it&#x27;s been an eye-opener into the business realities behind the biggest names and games in the industry.
To recap the story which first broke on Saturday, original Bayonetta voice artist Hellena Taylor released a series of videos on Twitter giving her reasons behind not reprising the role in the upcoming sequel. In the videos, she claims that she was offered a flat rate of $4,000USD to return and voice every line in the game. Citing her years of training, her history with the franchise, and the amount of money it has generated, she called the offer &quot;insulting&quot; and has called on supporters to boycott the game and instead donate the money to charity.

                              <span>And you can wield four guns!
Apogee Entertainment has unveiled Exocide, a cinematic, action-packed FPS where you can wield four guns to take down legions of insects, spiders, and unusual creatures. Coming from developer Hellforge Studios, its slightly-blockier aesthetic reminds us of some of the very best early PlayStation 2 and GameCube shooters. And it&#x27;s coming to Switch in 2023.
You&#x27;re humanity&#x27;s last hope against hordes of genetically-enhanced insects. Sounds like a nightmare, but with the ability to wield four weapons at once, your goal is simply to rack up points by eliminating these radioactive mutants. Speed and style are of the essence, and you can use jet boosts, wall jumps, and grind rails to get around fast.

Based on the amount of Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope content that we have seen over the past few months, we were concerned that a certain level of fatigue would be bound to set in before the game&#x27;s October 20th release date. Now, the big day is finally here and the reviews are out for the world to see. So, was the incessant publicity worth it? Welcome to our latest round up!
We couldn&#x27;t just leap into what other critics are saying without first giving our thoughts though, right? Despite some issues with the game&#x27;s ease, we were overall really rather impressed with Sparks of Hope, giving it an 8/10 in our review in which we described the game as &#x27;a must-play for Mario and strategy game enthusiasts alike&#x27;.

However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

                              <span>Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc discusses Persona 5 Royal, the hugely successful Atlus-developed RPG originally released in 2019 as a new version of the original 2016 Persona 5. After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we&#x27;ve been playing it. 
In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game&#x27;s opening moments (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven&#x27;t played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 Royal review.

And it is what you will have guessed upon reading that too. And yet, I enjoyed my ten minutes binning rubbish and mopping up stains (just stains, don&#x27;t worry about it). Then I played it again to see another ending, even knowing I am a big scaredy baby. Ugh. I will regret having played this next time I clean my flat at night.

So I thought this retrospective was a good opportunity to remind myself of why I still love this janky, weird ARPG about sad bloodsuckers so much, even 18 years after its release.

                              <span>Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it&#x27;s all about pacing. Persona 5&#x27;s blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There&#x27;s a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65&quot; 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.


Basically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn&#x27;t enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn&#x27;t for me. At this point, I&#x27;d invested £100 into my &quot;Do I like Persona 5?&quot; experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm &quot;No, mate, you don&#x27;t&quot;. So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I&#x27;d play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.

                              <span>I finished the original Persona 5 roughly four years ago, and it immediately earned my most coveted award: Edders Really Liked This A Lot, Perhaps More Than Anything Else. Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I&#x27;ve been afraid to make my return. You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be itching to delve back into what&#x27;s essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves&#x27; adventure, and yet it&#x27;s precisely because it blew me away the first time that I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go back.
Now? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it&#x27;s wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it&#x27;s the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm. Gi-give, no - give it here!

It’s fun to see that there’s now a way to play old Game Boy Advance cartridges on Valve’s handheld, and they actually make the games look pretty sweet to boot. No, this isn&#x27;t Valve following up their Switch emulator gaffe. Wave hello to the GB Operator.

The friendly cow-turtle-dog-thing won the vote held to decide Minecraft’s new mob, held for 24 hours between Friday and the start of Minecraft Live on Saturday. Sniffer topped the poll with more than half of the 3.5 million votes cast. You can watch the result being announced in the video below.

No details have been shared about whether you’ll be able to tune in on YouTube or Twitch for the stream, but Konami shared a link to a page on their site so you should be able to watch it there.

                              <span>In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an &quot;unlaunch&quot; of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.


&quot;The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right&quot;, reads Nvidia’s statement. &quot;Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the &quot;unlaunch&quot; button on the 4080 12GB.&quot;

                              <span>Have you ever been playing a game and craved some pizza? Of course you have. If you&#x27;re like me, you crave pizza literally all the time. Well, a new mod for Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is here to help. It lets you order a real world pizza delivery from Domino&#x27;s via an in-game NPC. Magic.

If you don&#x27;t have access however, there&#x27;s still time as you can still apply and more players will be let in over the course of this weekend. You might also enjoy watching some streamers play so you have a better sense of it ahead of its release in November.

                              <span>Blocky action RPG Minecraft Dungeons sees the arrival of the mob-packed Fauna Faire, its third seasonal update, on October 19th. Today’s Minecraft Live stream showed more of what to expect from the new season of Minecraft Dungeons, including four-player multiplayer for the Tower, a new merchant who handles enchantments, and a free new jungle biome level. I just like the look of the mob-themed onesies, personally.

Existing default picks Steve and Alex are going to be joined by seven new characters who reflect the wider world, although Mojang wouldn’t reveal any more about them ahead of today&#x27;s Minecraft Live stream. Not even their names, alas. I was going to suggest Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grub, but then realised that leaves one short. Gandalf, maybe?

We also found out more about what your hero uses to battle against the piglin invasion, and met some of the game’s key allies.

                              <span>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. 


Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

                              <span>In this week&#x27;s episode of The Game Informer Show, special guest and former Game Informer editor Jill Grodt joins us to talk about the best indie games of 2022 (so far) and a retro-inspired survival horror game, Signalis, that is blowing Alex away. Also, Wesley explains why he isn&#x27;t enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she&#x27;s been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

                              <span>In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don&#x27;t feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called &quot;Electromorphosis,&quot; which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

You&#x27;ll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18. If you want more Pokémon content before that, check out this extended gameplay demo from last week, the reveal of different new Pokémon, or our preview from earlier this year.</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.</span>

                              <span>Your hosts Wesley Leblanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Scorn, the new puzzle horror game from developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive. The two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it&#x27;s a game the two plan to continue playing. 
If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been following Scorn since its reveal years ago, or someone looking for an interesting Xbox console exclusive, look no further than today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Enjoy!


Scorn hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on October 14 (coming to both Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass too!) so if you&#x27;re reading this and are interested in checking the game out for yourself, you can download it today!

Umělá inteligence DeepMind našla ještě rychlejší algoritmus, ve kterém je potřeba jen 47 a 96 násobení.</span>

Judero is its name, and a surprisingly action-heavy adventure through the Scottish Borders is its game. Expect folklore, witches, jokes, stop motion, and beasties to battle and mind control.

                              <span>It&#x27;s probably a coincidence that I have a headache, but it seems appropriate for how out of my depth One Many Nobody was starting to make me feel. You&#x27;ve likely seen similar games, but this one mixes the usual 2D pixel puzzle business with some hazardous platforming, and a cloning system that rapidly move beyond the obvious &quot;standing on your own shoulders&quot; uses.
The balancing of all that didn&#x27;t quite work for me, but I&#x27;m generally fairly averse to puzzle games and demanding platformers, so you ought not to count that against it. If you&#x27;re more the type to take apart a puzzle step by step than to wing it while your subconscious yells from the sidelines, this could even be a real gem.

                              <span>Star Trek Online turns you into the captain of your own starship. This MMORPG neatly captures the essence of years of Gene Roddenberry’s hopeful, futuristic space romp, rolling in plotlines from the TV shows and movies to create a bizarrely playable blob of nerdy entertainment. It pits you against the Borg. It lets you visit Deep Space Nine. You can even battle the powerful and scary Crystalline Entity that wiped out Data’s homeworld. As a Trek fan, I enjoy Star Trek Online far, far too much.

                              <span>Overwatch 2 won’t be seeing any significant rebalances to its roster of heroes until the free to play shooter enters its second season in early December, Blizzard have confirmed. The game’s developers shared a blog post updating players on how the company are monitoring gameplay, maps, and competitive rankings in the immediate post-launch period. There will, however, be a targeted adjustment to tank Zarya in the next major patch going live on October 25th, Blizzard said.

EA and Motive just held a 14th anniversary livestream in honour of the original Dead Space – ivory, if you were wondering – and I can not-so-safely say that the new footage shown was crisp-gaggingly intimidating. You can check it out for yourself by watching the trailer below. Try not to be too long, won&#x27;t you?

                              <span>A thousand apologies, friends, for the gap in your Nate Files timeline. Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I&#x27;m alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.
Still, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It&#x27;s all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.

Box are asking just £57 for this Integral M-Series model, which supports 2000MB/s reads and 1600MB/s writes. Compare that to £75.99 for the same drive on Amazon, and you&#x27;ve got the makings of a great deal.

Check out the demo for Voices Of The Void, an upcoming game about running a space radio telescope array. Alone. In the woods. It has a pleasing manual process to find, target, and analyse signals, and a whole complex of servers and machinery to mantain. Plus, y&#x27;know, a whole feeling of creeping dread from gazing into space and wondering if anyone is looking back.

                              <span>You know what&#x27;s quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.
That brings me to the subject of today&#x27;s deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That&#x27;s a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market.

So, not VR or Steam Deck hardware then.

                              <span>A new blog post detailing Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s Ricochet anti-cheat strategy has revealed that only PC players will be asked to register a phone number before they can play the game. This is different from the blanket phone registration requirements that Activision Blizzard implemented for Overwatch 2’s Defense Matrix at that game’s launch at the beginning of this month, before removing them for most players last week. Modern Warfare 2 players on both Battle.net and Steam will need to register a number.

                              <span>Minecraft players have been able to vote on a new mob  once a year ever since 2017, and this year’s polling begins today. Things are working a little differently for 2022’s mob vote, though. Instead of casting your vote on Twitter, you’ll be able to head into a dedicated carnival-themed Bedrock server, do it in the Minecraft launcher, or on Minecraft.net. Devs Mojang will reveal which mob scored the most votes during the Minecraft Live livestream tomorrow.

                              <span>Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.
I was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, &quot;Is there a story?&quot;. And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there&#x27;ll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it&#x27;s a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it&#x27;s about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that&#x27;s already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It&#x27;s about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It&#x27;s about grim squishy noises and survival.
Scorn doesn&#x27;t have dialogue, or a map. It doesn&#x27;t really have a HUD, it doesn&#x27;t have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like &quot;Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it&#x27;ll open up a way forward!&quot; out loud. It won&#x27;t even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don&#x27;t know if I can recommend it.

                              <span>The EVGA P6 850W is a great high-capacity power supply, and today it&#x27;s been discounted by £30 over at Scan, dropping from £120 to £90. That&#x27;s a good deal on a PSU that meets the steep requirements of the RTX 4090, as well as Nvidia&#x27;s more sanely-specced RTX 40-series cards like the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4070 4080 12GB.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it&#x27;s way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it&#x27;s discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!
So: let&#x27;s cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it&#x27;s nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you&#x27;re paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you&#x27;ll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5).

                              <span>I have wanted to play Triangle Strategy since it was first announced for Nintendo Switch, but I realise now that I know next to nothing about it. All I&#x27;ve done is look at its screenshots and salivate at the mixture of 2D sprites, 3D environments, and tilt-shift camera trickery. 

Beyond that, I know that it&#x27;s a strategy RPG, and I know that it&#x27;s out on PC as of today.

                              <span>CD Projekt Red recently updated Cyberpunk 2077 to add items from the new anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Their own updates didn&#x27;t add the show&#x27;s omnipresent risk of cyberpsychosis, however, so a modder has stepped in to do it for them. The Wannabe Edgerunner mod adds a &quot;humanity&quot; cost to all cyberware implants and certain actions in the open-world shooter, as well as consequences for when your humanity gets too low.

                              <span>The developers of Röki are trading Norse mythology for Greek, it seems. Polygon Treehouse have announced that their next game is Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island, a non-linear adventure about uncovering a mystery, restoring an island paradise, and making friends with Greek gods. They also call it a &quot;friend &#x27;em up&quot;, getting in there with the &quot;&#x27;em up&quot; description before we can.

But here’s a bangin’ fanmade game, Touhou Luna Nights: what might have been a fairly rote 2D Metroidvania, were it not for both some time-bending tricks and a few key influences from the official Touhou schmups.

Inspired by new eco-friendly farming game Coral Island, which I&#x27;ve been playing this week, we talk about our favourite games that roll with an ecological protection theme. This is hard for Matthew, because he hates the environment (unless his immediate environment contains a can of Rio).
Matthew comes through with an excellent Cavern Of Lies about trees and tree monsters in games, where he attempts to pull the illusive Double Beckford on us. Does he succeed? Listen to find out.

                              <span>Detective games are often about filling in the blanks. A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they&#x27;ll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. 
The prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope&#x27;s Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares&#x27; Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it&#x27;s Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You&#x27;re still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages.

The beta is running from now until the end of October to trial planned changes and rummage up some feedback for Stellaris’ next update, 3.6 Orion. Don’t worry if you just fancy playing regular Stellaris; this is an opt-in thing. You can find out more by watching the video below.

It mostly consists of clips of the game’s dev team talking about playtests, but there are a few sections of gameplay and other footage from the game itself interspersed between those. Creative director Damien Kieken appears in the video, saying that the U in Project U “stands for Unite”.

                              <span>Fantasy construction sim Dwarf Fortress is, by the admission of its designers, difficult to learn and even harder to master. That’s why the game’s Steam version will have its own tutorial. Co-creator Zach Adams has roped in a novice playtester to try the tutorial out, in the form of his wife Annie. Annie bounced off the original, not-so-visually-appealing version of Dwarf Fortress. Yet, says Adams, the tutorial seems to be working to help Annie ease into the game at last.

                              <span>It’s been months since we’ve heard much from Bethesda’s upcoming sci-fi RPG Starfield, but studio director Todd Howard has been answering some questions about the game in a new video series. You can watch Howard chatting about the make-believe space programme below, where he covers if Starfield is hard sci-fi (not really), the games traits system, and dialogue. It seems that Starfield RPG&#x27;s are incredibly chatty, with many times more dialogue than Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

The footage shows off the complete time traveling Cereza puzzle we showed in our previous video detailing the game’s new features. We also present a combat challenge room in its entirety, plus as a few stylish skirmishes with the Homunguli in Tokyo’s ravaged city streets.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo&#x27;s BFF.


Bayonetta 3 is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can catch up on our exclusive features and videos at our cover hub by clicking the banner below. The game launches on October 28 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
&quot;For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.&quot;</span>

This is a setback for anti-piracy group BREIN, which had hoped to warn frequent uploaders without undermining their privacy. Ironically, BREIN is required to take legal action against individual pirates if it wants to get its message across.

Blocking measures have expanded to 39 countries in recent years, with the United States remaining the key absentee. The lack of US participation is partly due to a shortcoming in US copyright law, which lacks a carve-out for no-fault injunctions.

                              <span>The RTX 4090 sure is expensive, huh? Wouldn&#x27;t it be a shame if there was a graphics card that cost one eighth as much and offered the same basic technologies? Well, good news chums, EVGA&#x27;s RTX 2060 SC Gaming model is available for £212 - and despite costing 12.5% the price of the RTX 4090, it delivers at least 25% of the performance - nice. That&#x27;s like, double the value!

                              <span>The Samsung Odyssey G7 is one of the best gaming monitors in the world - or at least, that&#x27;s what I keep telling myself after buying one last year. This is a 32-inch model, offering a 2560x1440 resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate and a DisplayHDR 600 certification that means it actually delivers impactful HDR - a rarity at this price point. Anyway, it&#x27;s down to £499 today after a £100 discount, so listen up - here&#x27;s why I rate this monitor so highly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve long been excited about the possibilities offered by upcoming tidying things up nicely game A Little To The Left, and back in May this year Alice0 (one of us is RPS&#x27;s Mirror Universe Alice, but nobody knows which) finally had a crack at it. The way she wanted to organise keys wasn&#x27;t what the game thought was the right way, and her article examined this frustration; she described the canonical correct solution as being that of a &quot;domestic Joker&quot;.
The developers at Max Inferno Studios read this article and decided that, you know what? Alice0 was on to something. They contacted us to let us know that her piece was the inspiration for adding a feature called Let It Be, a skip puzzle function that you can access at any time. Anne Macmillan, who&#x27;s a co-founder of Max Inferno Studios as well as artist and animator for A Little To The Left, was kind enough to talk to me about it.

                              <span>Friends, let me admit something up top. I am the most tedious of Dead Rising apologists. I love its in-game timer. I adore its linear mission structure that is completely at odds with the expansive semi-open world shopping mall in which it takes place. Hell, I even like its severely stripped down Wii port. I firmly believe that Dead Rising is an all-time great, but also understand why folks have (reasonably) cooled on the game’s particular quirks.

                              <span>Hello, yes, it’s me, once again banging on about the WD Blue SN570. I just think it’s neat: a highly affordable yet remarkably quick M.2 SSD, with multiple capacities to choose from and regular sales making it even cheaper. Speaking of, today is the last day of the Amazon Prime Early Access Sale, which has the 1TB Blue SN570 down to £65.
That’s not quite its lowest price ever, but it does match its flash sale pricing during Prime Day back in July. And is an utter pittance for a 1TB NVMe SSD, let alone one that’s actually quite speedy. Amazon UK also have the 2TB version on sale for £128, just £1 more than its lowest dip on record (Prime Day 2022 again, as it happens). These prices are only available to Prime members, but the Blue SN570 ranks highly among the best SSDs for gaming, so they&#x27;re well deserving of your cash if you’re in need of PC storage improvements.

Each and every week the game pile grows higher, forming the walls of a virtually impenetrable digital structure known only as the ‘backlog’. As the games multiply, thickening the increasingly cell-like walls of our den of entertainment, we can only gaze on and hope it doesn’t one day become our tomb. On that light note, it’s nice to see that SteamDB now has a section showing what games are coming out on Steam every week.

Below Deck: Mediterranean had me covered last winter (alongside its Sailing Yacht spin-off), as I watched super yacht crew toil to meet the demands of the wealthy and unhinged. Then Love Island stepped up to fill a large portion of my summer with curated chaos. One guy confessed &quot;I licked her tit or whatever,&quot; in a shock revelation to his betrothed.
What&#x27;s on the reality TV menu for winter? Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey, baby. It&#x27;s on Netflix and I&#x27;m convinced it shares great parallels with some of my favourite RPGs of all time.

                              <span>Defining boomer shooter Doom, like Skyrim, is one of those games that’ll eventually be ported to everything. Microwaves. Checkouts. Voight-Kampff machines maybe, in the years to come. Right dang today though, you can (almost) play Doom in Notepad, or DOOMpad as its creator Samperson calls it. Catch a glimpse of the ripping and tearing in action by watching the video below.

                              <span>Cultic has really good headshots. I mean, it also has a lot of other things going for it, but it feels rude not to highlight this right at the very top because I think it’s important. Cultic’s headshots are sensational. Enemy noggins pop with a squelchy crack that tickles a very unnerving part of my brain, the resulting blood fountain spraying so high it causes the ceiling to drip with human juice long after your hopeless adversary has slumped to the floor. It’s gross. But. You know. It’s also kind of great.

Yes, DLSS 3 is the real deal. And no, neither of those make the RTX 4090 good value for money, even if it makes a compelling argument for Nvidia&#x27;s latest upscaling tech.

At the time it was swiftly shot down as an obvious joke, and I was shamed, but now the freeware game based on a ten-second joke in a 1997 episode of The Simpsons is out. So who&#x27;s laughing now, eh? Play it for yourself via creator Macaw45&#x27;s itch.

Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier has waded in to allege that, while there will be some fresh COD in the offing, it’ll be in the form of something like a paid expansion for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 instead of a full game. A Modern Warfare 2.5, if you will.

                              <span>The Saints Row reboot sees its first major update next month, but don’t expect any new stuff in Santo Ileso to play around with. Devs Volition insist this one’s just concentrating on hunting down and squashing the game’s many bugs. As we noted when it was released in August, Saints Row has rather a few technical issues. While Volition say this means they’re not at the stage where they can be “talking about roadmaps and expansions”, they are at least releasing a free cosmetic pack this week that includes some boots that look like bananas.

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>Amateur mad scientist Gabe (aka saveitforparts) has repurposed his Raspberry Pi-powered Tricorder and taught it to detect Starlink satellites passing overhead.

It promises a swankier virtual reality experience over the Meta Quest 2, with higher resolution displays, a lighter headset, and new Quest Touch Pro controllers included. It&#x27;s also launching imminently, on October 25th, with pre-orders open now.

The downside: it&#x27;ll cost you £1500/$1500 versus the Quest 2&#x27;s £400, with Meta saying the headset is designed for business and not gaming.

The game publisher had previously announced that their support services had been hacked and asked users not to open any links received from them via email. They&#x27;re now contacting users whose information was accessed and made available for sale by the hackers.

                              <span>I picked up the Romancelvania demo at Steam Next Fest on Alice Bee&#x27;s recommendation, and she was quite correct when she described it as &quot;extremely relevant to [my] interests&quot;. So relevant, in fact, that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this wasn&#x27;t an attempt at psychological sabotage disguised as a friendly gesture. (You wouldn&#x27;t do that to me, would you, Alice?)
Romancelvania is exactly what it sounds like: dating sim meets Castlevania. No idea how I missed it during my own perusal of the demo list, because unsurprisingly it&#x27;s immediately become my favourite thing I&#x27;ve ever played at a Steam Next Fest. I was so drawn in, in fact, that I&#x27;ve been having a tough time putting it down, even when I really need to — hence my suspicion that this was some sort of test on Alice&#x27;s part. No idea if I&#x27;ve succeeded or failed.
The demo starts on a promising note, awakening you in the persona of a comically brooding and exaggeratedly shirtless hunky Dracula. (The final game will include the option to play as a Lady Drac, if you prefer, who will not be shirtless, but not by a large margin.)

                              <span>I was underwhelmed by Prime Day’s lack of compelling desktop RAM deals, and Amazon’s follow-up – the Prime Early Access Sale – is also pretty quiet for good memory discounts. However, there are some intriguing offers on DDR5 RAM, which is perfect timing: AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs have just launched, and unlike their Intel 13th Gen/Raptor Lake rivals, won’t be compatible with older DDR4 at all.

Apparently it was quite technically impressive for its time, as one of the very first 3D pool or snooker games. I wouldn&#x27;t have known anything about that as an eight-year-old playing games after school. Much like I knew absolutely nothing about how to play pool well. I mainly just liked the noise it made when a ball was potted. Whether it was my ball or my opponent&#x27;s ball: that was just extraneous detail.

                              <span>Not keen on the snazzy driving effects in recently announced racer Need For Speed Unbound? That’s okay, because devs Criterion Games have confirmed that you don’t have to play the game with great big puffs of colourful smoke dredging up from your car’s wheels, or cartoon wings popping out when you drive up a ramp and get some air. I’m into the effects myself, but it’s good to know you have the option to turn them off if you’re not.

                              <span>Coral Island  self-describes as a &quot;reimagining of farming games&quot;, but if we&#x27;re being real it doesn&#x27;t reimagine the Stardew Valley template totally differently. The titular island, and your overgrown plot of farmland on it, has almost the same layout as Stardew Valley, and the tasks you do - growing stuff, keeping animals, making friends with locals, exploring a mine five levels at a time, and appeasing local spirits by giving them bundles of different crops - will also be very familiar to any DewHeads (that&#x27;s what we call ourselves).
That&#x27;s not to say Coral Island isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s all in very beautiful bouncy 3D, for one thing, and I found the island setting (which impacts the flora, fauna, and architecture in general) made everything feel less like work. Combined with a thread of environmentalism weaving through the game, and the fact that Coral Island is slightly easier than Stardew Valley, and you feel like you&#x27;re doing more progress in less time. If you loved the vibe of ConcernedApe&#x27;s smash hit, but found the need to hand-write your own almanac a bit intimidating, this is the game for you.

Kinoshita also went into some detail about Additional Orders’ other characters, including punch-maestro Chris Redfield.

                              <span>Update: It looks like the UK&#x27;s 512GB deal and the US&#x27;s 1TB deal are no longer available. Boo, but also, the 400GB model is now on sale, so I&#x27;ve replaced the former with this mid-sized card in the lists below. I&#x27;ve also updated the 256GB SanDisk Ultra&#x27;s price, as it&#x27;s dropped slightly further. The otherwise original version of the article is as follows...

In case you missed the mega-guide that went up earlier, today marks the start of Amazon’s Prime Early Access Sale: a two-day buffet of discounts that’s exclusive to Prime members. That includes loads on PC gaming hardware, though my eyes were most immediately caught by something not very desktop-grade at all. The SanDisk Ultra, one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck, is on sale across a choice of capacities – with the 1TB model getting especially juicy &gt;50% savings in both the UK and US.

TheGhostOfHope has tweeted a list of what they say are upcoming operators for the military FPS sequel, launching later this month. Among the other spots are a potential return for the controversial Roze skin, and Call Of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s protagonist Nick Reyes.

It&#x27;s a competitive PVE game where teams of heroes fight it out to finish a dungeon run the fastest. And having seen a brief presentation of it behind closed doors, it looks like a good time - albeit one taking heavy inspiration from its main competitors.

Like Prime Day, this sale requires a Prime membership to access all the best deals, but so far those have included some tempting savings on some quality PC gaming kit. It therefore marks a good chance to replace any worn-out peripherals or make a component upgrade, especially if it can&#x27;t wait until Black Friday 2022. I’ve rounded up a few dozen of the choicest deals, from Amazon UK and Amazon US, below.

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

                              <span>Viola, a newcomer to the series and Bayonetta 3’s second playable protagonist, is a figure shrouded in intrigue. This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>

                              <span>Bayonetta 3 retains the over-the-top spectacle of its predecessors, but Platinum Games isn’t resting on the series&#x27; laurels. The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. 
Before we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

                              <span>If you fancy yourself both a Sonic and Monster Hunter fan, Sega has a collaboration aimed squarely at you. The company announced that the upcoming Sonic Frontiers is getting a special content pack themed after Monster Hunter. Best of all, it’s free!

According to Sega’s Japanese website, the bundle features the Rioreus equipment to outfit Sonic. You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It&#x27;s a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year. Check out Sonic in his armored glory in the photo gallery below.

The Monster Hunter pack will be available to download on November 14, almost a week after Frontiers launches on November 8. For more Sonic Frontiers, check out the latest trailer featuring the reveal of Super Sonic.</span>

New data shared by tracking company MUSO shows that the number of visits to pirate sites has increased by more than 20 percent compared to last year. Movie piracy saw the most rapid increase after the Covid release slowdown. In line with tradition, the United States continues to harbor the most pirates in absolute numbers.

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on November 8.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;Which video game franchise has the best soundtrack?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

The publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from &quot;Aku Aku&#x27;s Steam-In Pizza Shack&quot;) to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. 
Additionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.
Are you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time on Steam? What do you think the rumored new game will be? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>With Persona 5 Royale set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Switch on October 21, Atlus has announced the multiplatforms release dates for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. 
On January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.
Persona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020.

Some choose to get out while they can to avoid a full-blown lawsuit, but others only see a potentially lucrative gap in the market. Rolling the dice can pay off but it can also go terribly wrong, as a PrimeStreams reseller has just discovered.

                              <span>To celebrate our Bayonetta 3 cover story, we&#x27;re bringing back good old-fashioned Replay to revisit its direct predecessor, Bayonetta 2. You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. 
Released in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn&#x27;t happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn&#x27;t meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action. Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I dig into my personal GOTY for 2014 and chat all about our Bayonetta 3 cover.

                              <span>Mortal Kombat was released three decades ago, in October of 1992, and its gory style of fighting has persisted through the years, through controversies, movies, and more. 
The NetherRealm-developed series celebrates its 30th anniversary this month, and the studio has released a new trailer to highlight the legacy of the franchise and bathe players in nostalgia and hype. If you&#x27;re looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check. Maybe something like that comes at a later date this month – who knows? – but today&#x27;s trailer is all about Mortal Kombat&#x27;s 30-year history in video games and other entertainment mediums. 
Check out the Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, the video above doesn&#x27;t announce any new movies or games, or even DLC for Mortal Kombat 11, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s still a great watch nonetheless, especially for longtime fans. 
Here are some fun Mortal Kombat 30th Anniversary logos as well:

                              <span>Nintendo has revealed what the next Splatoon 3 Splatfest will have players battling over and it begins next month. 
More specifically, it begins November 11 at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. This is perfect timing because it&#x27;s a three-way battle between Grass-type Pokémon, Fire-type Pokémon, and Water-type Pokémon, the types of the three starters we&#x27;ll be choosing from in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet on November 18. Check out the announcement tweet for yourself below: 
Grass-type. Fire-type. Water-type. This debate has perplexed our great philosophers for ages. Let’s settle it.
#Splatfest collaboration begins 11/11 at 4pm PT!

The event will begin on November 11 and it will run through 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on November 13. While nothing is confirmed just yet, the image released alongside today&#x27;s news seems to tease some Pokémon-inspired gear. Hopefully, we all get to show off our favorite of the three types in our gear and weapons of choice. It&#x27;s also worth noting that Nintendo calls this Splatfast a &quot;special...collaboration&quot; so there might be even more  Pokémon integration than we expect. Only time will tell. 
In the meantime, read Game Informer&#x27;s Splatoon 3 review and then watch this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet trailer released yesterday.

                              <span>The new guards of Batman&#x27;s city rise up in the launch trailer for Gotham Knights released by WB Games Montréal today. 
With just two weeks to go until the October 21 release date, marketing for Gotham Knights has begun to ramp up. We recently went hands-on with the game, and you can read our impressions and key takeaways about how it plays now, and recent videos have shared some of the behind-the-scenes inspirations for the game&#x27;s narrative design. But now, as the official release date draws nearer, WB Games Montréal is bringing the hype. 
Check out the Gotham Knights launch trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Gotham Knights&#x27; story of the Court of Owls and how they interact with both the Gotham Knights – Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood – as well as other Gotham villain mainstays like Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Clayface, and Harley Quinn is shaping up to be something exciting for the Bat-verse of games. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer now to experience it for ourselves because Gotham Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21.

                              <span>Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have revealed that Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Great, Daddy Day Care) will star in the studio&#x27;s next game, which remains unannounced. 
This news comes after weeks of Kojima teasing a face with the words, &quot;Who Am I?&quot; in bold white letters. The face was obscured due to some neat shadow tricks, but right from the jump, fans tried determining whose face it might be, and it didn&#x27;t take long for Fanning to become the frontrunner. Continual teasing led us to yesterday, when Kojima finally released the images below, confirming Fanning as the face in question.

As you can see, Kojima has now moved away from &quot;Who Am I?&quot; to &quot;Where Am I?&quot; alongside a tease that we&#x27;ll likely learn more at one of the two rem…</span>

                              <span>When Bayonetta 3&#x27;s first gameplay trailer hit last year, her new braided hairstyle caught the attention of fans for its resemblance to the look of Cereza, the little girl who tagged along with players in the first game. Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game&#x27;s focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. 
First, to provide some context, here&#x27;s a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta&#x27;s backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…</span>

                              <span>Nintendo has released the first trailer for its upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie and it features plenty of the famed plumber as well as Toad, Luigi, Bowser, the Mushroom Kingdom, and more. It also features our first listen to Chris Pratt&#x27;s Mario.
Pratt teased back in June that his Mario voice is &quot;unlike anything you&#x27;ve heard in the Mario world,&quot; and it turns out he&#x27;s right in that we&#x27;ve never heard Pratt&#x27;s voice in the world of Mario, which is to say his Mario just sounds like him. Elsewhere in the trailer, which aired during a special Nintendo Direct all about the film today, we get a glimpse at the movie&#x27;s villain, Bowser, who is voiced by Jack Black, Toad, voiced by Keegan-Michael Key, and even a quick shot at Luigi at the end. 
Check out the Super Mario Bros. movie trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Super Mario Bros. looks like you&#x27;d expect, in line with Illumination&#x27;s other animated movies like Despicable Me and Minions. It looks like it will be a great time at the theater, making the wait until its silver screen release on April 7 that much harder.

                              <span>EA has officially revealed Need For Speed Unbound, the first new Need For Speed game in three years, and it hits new-gen consoles and PC this December. 
After leaking earlier this week, EA has released the official reveal trailer for Need For Speed and as leaks and rumors suggested, it&#x27;s quite a drastic shift in style for the series. It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it&#x27;s mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won&#x27;t be for everybody. 
Check out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer&#x27;s song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.
Only time will tell but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn&#x27;t mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game.

Returning favorites from 2019&#x27;s Modern Warfare like Ghost and Price make an appearance in the trailer as do newcomers to the series, both good and bad, all to the backdrop of the war on drugs, cartels, terrorism, and more.

                              <span>Since the launch of Overwatch 2 earlier this week, the game has struggled in a number of ways. Some players are excited about the numbered sequel while others wonder why this wasn&#x27;t just a big update for the original Overwatch, which is no longer accessible. Regardless, actually playing Overwatch 2 has been its own challenge due to at least two DDoS attacks Blizzard has weathered, making it tough to actually queue into the game and access it beyond the eternal loading screen. 
On top of that, some players have found themselves unable to play once logged in due to the game&#x27;s SMS Protect system, which requires you to give Blizzard a &quot;unique&quot; phone number for authentication purposes. The only problem is that pre-paid phones, which make up not just the boxed phones in stores like Walmart but m…</span>

                              <span>Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.
Tequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. 
🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G
October 4, 2022
Gylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.
Will you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.
PlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. 
Completing campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. 
Digital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. 
If you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It&#x27;s unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn&#x27;t want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn&#x27;t seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can&#x27;t access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). 
PlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.</span>

Gotham Knights launches in just a couple of weeks, and Batman fans have been excited – and trepidatious – about the Bat clan’s big family adventure. To find out how the project is shaping up, I took a trip to Warner Bros. Montreal to play two hours of the game. I spent time-fighting crime as all four characters, explored Gotham’s open world, and took down criminals alongside a co-op partner. I also chatted with the dev team to uncover more nuggets about what the adventure brings to the table. Here are some general hands-on impressions and intr…</span>

                              <span>Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the new-gen release of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot alongside news that it hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January. 
More specifically, Kakarot comes to new-gen consoles on January 13, 2023, meaning we&#x27;re just a few months away from this re-release. To accompany today&#x27;s news, Bandai Namco has released a new trailer showcasing some of DBZ&#x27;s most iconic moments alongside some comparison clips between the PlayStation 4/Xbox One version of Kakarot and the upcoming new-gen update. Unsurprisingly, it looks a lot better. 
Check it out for yourself below: 


Kakarot on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S features updated visuals that look even better than the original release and 60 frames-per-second gameplay. If you already own the game, you can upgrade to the new-gen version of Kakarot for free. 
This new trailer also teases what&#x27;s to come in the game&#x27;s second season pass. The first DLC is called Bardock: Alone Against Fate, and it&#x27;s a new story arc. Two more story arc DLCs are in the season pass as well. Plus, Season Pass 2 owners will get a cooking item that increases HP and Ki defense. 
While waiting for January, read Game Informer&#x27;s Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review to find out why we think the game is flawed but still highly enthralling.

                              <span>Dynasty Warriors developer Omega Force and EA revealed Wild Hearts last week, giving players a glimpse of what&#x27;s to come in this new beast-hunting game. 
Similar to Capcom&#x27;s Monster Hunter series, the central draw of Wild Hearts is the massive creatures and how you successfully hunt them down. You craft new weapons and armor along the way, growing stronger and stronger with each hunt, as you attempt to rid the land of Azuma of these beasts. The reveal trailer released last week gave some quick glimpses of what that looks like, but a new gameplay trailer showcases seven minutes of Wild Hearts gameplay. 
Check it out for yourself below:

To je také důvod, proč Goodoffer24 staví Microsoft na vedlejší kolej snížením ceny za Windows 10 a Microsoft Office, čímž činí proces aktualizace mnohem dostupnějším. Dokonce můžete koupit obojí naráz, a tím ušetříte ještě více. A tady je, co můžete dostat.</span>

                              <span>Are you ready to be sent to Camp ChillyWawa and Dr. Periowinkle&#x27;s mansion as an intelligence agent?
Armed with a book of knowledge, or Pink Digital Assistant, your mission will be to save children from dangerous threats and undo a spell cast on a little girl who has been transformed into a wombat. To succeed you will need to visit several countries and even travel into the past. On your way you will encounter historical monuments and exhibits.
The ScummVM team is proud to announce that The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril and The Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink are finally ready for their testing period.
If you want to help with the tests, use the latest daily build of ScummVM to play the Windows version of the games. Please report any issues you encounter on our bug tracker. Be sure to follow our testing and bug reporting guidelines.
