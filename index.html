                              <span>The King of Kaijus, Godzilla, is now present in the colorful realms of Fortnite, and you can unlock it to cause waves of radioactive destruction on your enemies.


The Kaiju is one of many recent additions that have been made to the game, and like previous collaborations, it&#x27;s part of the battle pass. The latest launch just adds to the long list of special collaborations that Epic Games has made with their battle royale. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can obtain this special skin and if it involves any kind of microtransactions.


How to get the Godzilla skin in Fortnite


Godzilla is part of the new pass, and to be more specific, it can be unlocked from Season 6, Chapter 1. This season, the pass has been completely revamped, and the format of the rewards has been altered. However, you&#x27;ll first need to own the Battle Pass, which costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock.


Having the pass won&#x27;t be enough, as you&#x27;ll need to wait for the correct date in order to unlock the skin. On January 17, you will be able to unlock the King of Monsters, and more rewards that are part of the pass. Additionally, you&#x27;ll also need to complete the quests in order to play with the skin.




The quests, as of writing, are unknown. These quests will become available only on January 17, so you&#x27;ll have to wait for the time being. It will be mandatory for you to complete all these missions if you want to get the Godzilla skin to use in Fortnite.


For the time being, it appears that this skin will be exclusive to the Season Pass. However, Epic has made older skins available in the in-game store that were once exclusive to Season Passes. If that happens in the future, it will be great for those who might not be able to afford the pass at the moment.

                              <span>Game development is getting more and more costly, in terms of both time and money, which makes a lot of sense, seeing as video games (especially AAA ones) have become more ambitious in nature. This, however, is also admittedly quite frustrating for gamers all around the world because companies tend to announce new projects years in advance and then go on complete radio silence for extensive periods of time, without releasing any new information, images or trailers. 


Making video games takes time, and we always prefer companies not to rush or overwork developers, but they also should stop announcing video games so eagerly, sometimes before they even have any gameplay to show. As a result of this alarmingly common practice, there are now a lot of announced video games that we know very lit…</span>

                              <span>For its glorious 20th anniversary celebration, Half-Life 2 finally got baked-in mod support. Though the classic - and now refined - version of the classic remains an all-timer, there are some mods out there that improve or change the experience in unforeseen and amazing ways. Let&#x27;s have a look at the best of them.

Entropy: Zero 2


Remember how the original Half-Life had expansions where you got to play with someone other than Gordon Freeman, and it still rocked? We got none of that with Half-Life 2, by the official means, that is. If you want to step into the shoes of a completely different character in that world, then consider giving Entropy: Zero 2 a shot. This time you play not as a the hero, but as an especially nasty member of the Combine. 


Zero 2 is so good it…</span>

These abilities, as their names suggest, are bonus effects that are available on certain rods.

Some of these rods with passive abilities can be unlocked by completing certain in-game achievements. For the rest, you&#x27;ll have to spend your in-game coins to buy them from the shop.

It goes without saying that a game based on Jujutsu Kaisen is bound to be popular. The global servers include almost every popular character at launch. Just like the Japanese servers, a clear tier list already emerged in the first week. Certain characters are simply better and far more effective compared to the remaining names present in the game.

The global servers might have different characters available on the roster, but it&#x27;s less than the Japanese version. That said, you can still have a healthy set of choices while making the pick. To classify the characters, I have used four tiers.

Like every gacha, you&#x27;ll be relying mostly on the banners to get your share of characters to aid your team construction. While I found most of the characters pretty well-balanced, certain ones are better than others. Investing in them will make it the best possible use of your resources, and you will be one step closer to reaching the endgame quickly.

Base on the extremely popular Overlord series, the gacha features all the iconic characters that can found in the anime.

                              <span>GSC Game World&#x27;s Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl has just received an extra patch that you can now download.


The game came out on November 20 and, even though most have been raving about it, it&#x27;s hard to acknowledge the release version&#x27;s rougher and likely radioactive edges. GSC Game World was quick not just to address the issues, but to come up with a patch. And what a patch that was, one single piece of software that dared to fix over 650 serious stability issues.


Though the original patch seems to have solved what it had set out to, there were some more issues left unaddressed, which GSC Game World is now attempting to fix with this new patch. The smaller but non-negligible list of fixes includes:



Fixed an issue when the second wave  would not spawn during the “On the Edge” mission, blocking further progression.


Fixed the issue when  could be found dead during the “A Minor Incident” mission, blocking further progression.


The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the  first during the “Just Like the Good Old Days” mission, blocking further progression.


The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the “All That is Left” mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.


Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.


Fixed an issue when  could be missing during the “Visions of Truth” mission.


A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.



GSC Game World has been doing a great job of dealing with these issues, and a large part of that is thanks to great cooperation with players, whom the team thanks and asks to keep on reporting any future issues here.


You can now enjoy a much more stable version of Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

As you approach the late game, self-preservation becomes key, and the enemies that you encounter can be deadly. Naturally, getting better armor is almost mandatory, and the Operator Exoskeleton is a great choice. That said, finding it can be a bit troublesome if you don&#x27;t know where you need to look.


Stalker 2 Operator Exoskeleton location explained


To reach the Operator Exoskeleton, you&#x27;ll need to be a bit patient. This armor set is located at Fluoridation Station in Jupiter. To be more specific, this location can be found close to Pripyat&#x27;s border. To find it easily, just go to the marked location on the map, and you&#x27;ll come…</span>

How to get the Fischgiving limited fish in Fisch


The Turkey is a limited fish which can be found on the Ancient Isles. It came with the Ancient Isles update on November 30, 2024 in celebration of Thanksgiving and is only visible during the in-game Fischgiving event. The event doesn&#x27;t have a confirmed end date yet, but if you want to fill up your Bestiary, I suggest going into the game asap and setting yourself for the long haul.


The best way to ensure you will get the limited Fischgiving fish is to have the best available Rod in the game. I have m…</span>

How to farm Polyatomic Ion Particles in The First Descendant


Polyatomic Ion Particles can be found by completing various missions, defeating “Mission Monster,” or completing the Quarantine Zone in the Fallen Ark area of The Fortress. 


These are all the sources where the “Mission Monster” drops the Polyatomic Ion Particle:


Fortress

Ship Charging Facility


Frozen Shipyard


Giant Hangar

                              <span>One of the few cosmetic choices you have access to in Towers of Aghasba is your hairstyle, but the method to change your hair is not exactly obvious. If you&#x27;re looking for a new look, here is how and where you can find the Barber in the game.


Where to find the Barber in Towers of Aghasba


Despite not being a particularly important mechanic in Towers of Aghasba, you can change your hairstyle by speaking with the Barber in Midhaven. However, you won&#x27;t have access to him until a few hours into the game since he is in Midhaven itself.


To unlock the Barber, you first need to gain access to Midhaven by repairing the Lutoro Bridge. This is actually the main story, so if you just follow that quest line, you&#x27;ll reach this point without any problem.

When you&#x27;ve reached Midhaven, you&#x27;ll notice that it is all in ruin and that there is no Barber present. To actually unlock him, you need to upgrade Midhaven to Tier 1 so that there is actually room for him to set up shop. You&#x27;ll need mostly commonly found materials to do so, but one of the materials Gold Dust, isn&#x27;t as obvious to find. Gold Dust can be found by harvesting the debris around Midhaven.


Once you&#x27;ve upgraded Midhaven to Tier 1, you can find the Barber at his stall to the right of the Midhaven Village Board. Changing your hairstyle is free of charge, so it can be done as often as you like.

                              <span>Anime and manga aren&#x27;t necessarily the best producers of good parental figures. Despite being for young boys, shonen anime and manga are notorious for this. One Piece, in particular, has some of the worst parents. It ranges from the usual deadbeat father to the outright heinous crime against humanity.


You can argue that should be expected, as the series is literally about crimes and piracy. But surprisingly, being on the side of justice doesn&#x27;t equate to being a good parent. In fact, some of the best parents are pirates. Meanwhile, here are the ten worst parents in One Piece.

                              <span>Light of Motiram&#x27;s promotional crusade is in full steam, with Tencent releasing a massive new gameplay showcase of the upcoming title.


A tsunami of controversy hit the Chinese giant as its recently announced title, Light of Motiram, seemed to look a lot like Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West — unfortunately, two of the most unique-looking PlayStation exclusives. 




Likely in an attempt to either clear its name or just make Motiram feel appealing to the point of causing amnesia in originality-starved players, Tencent released a 16-minute gameplay showcase. There&#x27;s a plot twist, however, and that&#x27;s about how Motiram looks like it&#x27;s taking too much influence from other games as well.


Though the presentation isn&#x27;t in English, it features various gameplay elements that appear to be straight out of other games. For one, it&#x27;s impossible to ignore the robot hovering over us, which is highly reminiscent of our robot companion, Ghost, from the Destiny series.

Perhaps most interestingly, though, is how the game looks a lot like Horizon, but actually seems to play like Valheim. Everything, from the hunting, gathering, and building - even down to the funny droplets that rain down from the character&#x27;s body when he&#x27;s over-encumbered in Valheim — makes an appearance in Motiram.


Still, it&#x27;s undeniable that if you manage to look past everything, Motiram looks functional. Most cobbled-together games tend to break at the seams, but Motiram looks like it plays without any issues, so that&#x27;s something.

                              <span>A recent BBC investigation has concluded that the most popular mobile games in the UK ignore rules pertaining to the disclosure of loot box usage in video games.


Out of the 45 most popular loot box-containing video games currently being sold in the UK, only two advertise the presence of loot box shenanigans as they should under the current regulations.


The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google&#x27;s Play Store, which along with Apple&#x27;s App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.


Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes — 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.


However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.


Monopoly GO, the most successful game on Google&#x27;s Play store — with over 50 million downloads and over 3 billion dollars in transactions — does not correctly advertise its usage of loot boxes.


Loot boxes have been a huge problem in the world of non-mobile games for a while, but gamers grew so tired of them that even big companies have been rethinking the practice. Spending real money or even just playing incessantly to open a box that may or may not contain an extra item players want is an extra-awful game of carrot-on-a-stick, one that has proven harmful both to the gaming industry and the livelihood of players.


In the mobile scene, however, things are different, and games following highly addictive and costly loot box mechanics have been thriving for a while. The less immersive and more quick reward-oriented nature of mobile games proves fertile ground for this highly addictive and dangerous practice to fester, and festered it sure has.


The BBC has asked Hasbro to comment on the issue, but has yet to receive a reply.

The Guildford, England-based game maker had promised procedurally generated brilliance but fell somewhat short, at least in the eyes of early players. However, the title has received more than 35 named updates and five content patches in the eight years since its launch, and the hard work has clearly paid off.

Do bits of your HUD keep disappearing? Be of good cheer, for GSC Game World have released the first proper S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornbyl update, which patches out over 650 different bugs and issues. These range from more significant problems such as crashing and progression-blockers in certain missions, to relatively negligible stuff like wonky NPC voice volume during storms.

                              <span>The Samsung Pro Plus is, alongside the Logitech G502 Hero, one of those hardware products that rocks up at literally every single sales event in the calendar. Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good&#x27;un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.

                              <span>Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it&#x27;s still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It&#x27;s pronounced &quot;Trese&quot;) nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I&#x27;m about ready to start recommending it.
I&#x27;m a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren&#x27;t bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn&#x27;t yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.

                              <span>Back when Digital Extremes were largely known for collaborating with Epic Games on the Unreal Tournament series, they made a little game called Dark Sector. Released in 2008, it&#x27;s part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector&#x27;s gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.

                              <span>To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.
In the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.

                              <span>As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.
This time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.

                              <span>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in Selaco. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she&#x27;s over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.

                              <span>Seeing great games sell too poorly for the pursestring goblins to shell out for a sequel is always a heartache, but it really stung to learn that the incredible Dead Space remake didn’t catch on enough for EA to greenlight a remake of Dead Space 2 (even if EA were a little spotty on the details). Doubly so in the wake of The Callisto Protocol - a game I still think is worth picking up on a deep discount, if you like hitting gross things with a big bit of metal. It’s quite exciting, then, to learn that the next game from Lies Of P developer Round 8 Studios might just replace that severed limb. Alongside a sequel to the puppety soulslike, they’re also working on a sci-fi survival horror game, via Eurogamer.

Created by &quot;a global team of veteran game developers&quot;, it&#x27;s the story of a Palestinian woman grappling with the loss of her baby after fleeing a bloody assault on her town.

Yet they’re also both very good at what they do, and are now sharing Black Friday discount honours.

Rather than do the usual routine of just suggesting the WD Black SN850X again, however, there’s no better SSD-for-yer-money deal right now than the Crucial T500, which is going for an exceptionally low £58 right now for the 1TB capacity – down from £120. The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.

                              <span>Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.
This is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.

These days, of course, Black Friday sort of just starts whenever retailers feel like it, which is why we’ve already seen the kind of Steam Deck microSD deals that I’d have normally spent this morning writing up. Instead, here’s an alternate for the more eager screwdriverists among you: up to 50% off the Crucial P310, currently our top pick of the recent breed of Steam Deck replacement SSDs.

                              <span>I greatly enjoyed tooting with my mouse in Trombone Champ on a flat monitor, but in retrospect it&#x27;s the perfect candidate for conversion to virtual reality. It&#x27;s small in scope, for one, but also VR would let you see through the eyes of the tooter and slide your trombone note up and down by holding the motion controllers up to your face.

So it is in Trombone Champ: Unflattened, a VR spin-off that&#x27;s out now.

                              <span>It&#x27;s almost the end of November, which means it is technically but not spiritually still autumn. It is spiritually winter, the season of wearing gloves and using my phone&#x27;s flashlight to look for my dog&#x27;s poos in the long grass. Yet it&#x27;s not the Steam winter sale that started yesterday, but the Steam autumn sale. 

Discounts are definitely never a bad thing, but Steam sales used to feel like big events on the PC gaming calendar. They don&#x27;t anymore, to me. Friends, are Steam sales still exciting to you?

Remember earlier this year when Nintendo revealed its range of controller button fidget toys, sold exclusively in the gacha machines of its Japan stores? Well, it looks like there&#x27;s a new collection in town to get us envious all over again.
As spotted by a whole host of people today on Twitter and BlueSky, it appears that the Tokyo Nintendo Store is home to a new gacha collection, one that contains miniature magnetic Zonai devices from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Oh, be still, my beating heart.

                              <span>What are the best couch co-op games on Switch?
We thought that those of you not braving the sales stampede might be relaxing at home on the sofa, possibly stuffed with cold turkey, and considering some easygoing couch co-op. In which case, here are our top picks, rejigged with our updated list format - enjoy!

While there&#x27;s a huge variety of gaming experiences available on Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid console, there&#x27;s a good chance that couch co-op games were a big part of the reason you bought it. The Switch is tailor-made for multiplayer experiences thanks to its Joy-Con controllers, which double up as two separate pads when you&#x27;ve got a friend nearby, even when you&#x27;re out and about.

It&#x27;s no secret that the Switch eShop is home to a ridiculous amount of utter slop alongside the genuinely good games, but what&#x27;s baffling us is just how unwilling Nintendo seems to be to improve anything.
Just this week, we highlighted a game that blatantly copied Witch Beam&#x27;s homework with Unpacking, and now it seems as though Pokémon is once again in the firing line. Specifically, following the success of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket on mobile, a new game has cropped up for pre-order on the eShop called TCG Card Shop Master.

For many years it&#x27;s been slim pickings for Star Trek games on Nintendo systems, and while we&#x27;ve got our fingers crossed that Star Trek: Resurgence will get ported sooner rather than later, Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova — a solid co-op adventure from Tessera Studios — has been the only game to go boldly on Switch. Oh, and the TNG table in Pinball FX.
However, according to an eShop listing, Santa is bringing Trek fans a present on 25th December in the form of Star Trek: Legends. Santa, or publisher Qubic Games - one of the two. Keen fans may recognise the title as Emerald City Games&#x27; &quot;strategy-based RPG&quot; launched on Apple Arcade back in 2021, which recently got a Steam release.

Back in 2014, IGN, like many outlets, shared its review of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. While the vast majority showered the 3DS remakes with praise, IGN was slightly more critical, awarding them a 7.8/10 and noting that they have &quot;too much water&quot; (among other criticisms, naturally).

Developer Poncle has posted an update on the future of the wildly popular Vampire Survivors, noting that the game &quot;isn&#x27;t over&quot; and that more content is on the way.
However, you&#x27;ll have a bit of a hard time deciphering the upcoming road map, as it&#x27;s been presented in the most ridiculous way possible.

A new survey conducted by Japanese employment agency Gakujo reveals that Nintendo is the third most sought-after employer in the region.
This comes via Otaku Soken (thanks, Automaton) and is based on responses from 5,476 university students across Japan. Nintendo is the highest company from the entertainment sector, and is only beat by trade firm Itochu at number one and biotech corporation Ajinomoto at number two.

Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic&#x27;s advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled After Inc: Revival, a blend of city builder and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.

But what if you could not only survive it, but tame it?
I am Bohdan Beastmaster, aspiring wrangler of all the radiation-twisted insults to God that occupy the Zone. One of its rogue Artifacts exploded my flat, and rather than find a place on SpareRoom, I’ve gone for the easier and safer option of venturing into the wilds of Chornobyl – armed not with rusty AKs or scavenged grenades but the teeth and claws of my mutant soon-to-be companions. The absence of any actual fauna-influencing tools or techniques only makes my plan even simpler: find beasts, aggro beasts onto human enemies, win.

It sounds lovely, is comfortable enough to wear for hours, and has such a long battery life that we should probably just consider it witchcraft by now. Also, it’s just had its price cut for Black Friday week, dropping to a very agreeable £110 in the UK and $126.

                              <span>Another explosion sends the bodies flying. &quot;Has anyone been here long enough to tell me what the hell is going on!?&quot; the sergeant yells. He sounds annoyed. The field hospital is gone, probably blown to pieces. Troops keep wandering north and disappearing from view, only to come flying back as airborne cadavers moments later. The number of corpses and spilled backpacks on the road imply that someone in battalion headquarters (if such a place even exists) has made a terrible decision. If the Colonial forces want to win the persistent online war of Foxhole, suggests the sergeant with his many irritated noises, then someone needs to piece these dying fools together. As the only medic in a 500 metre radius, that means me.

                              <span>The genre of &#x27;Action RPG&#x27; is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are &#x27;ARPGs&#x27;. Which stands for &#x27;Action RPG&#x27;. But Zelda games are &#x27;Action RPGs&#x27;, which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to &#x27;ARPG&#x27;. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.
It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo &#x27;Diablo-likes&#x27;. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is &quot;like the game I make, but a bit crap&quot;.

                              <span>Back in January I wrote a (supporters only) post about how tired I am of all survival games starting off the same. Here&#x27;s the gist of it: I&#x27;ve had enough of gathering rocks and sticks to make a crafting bench, from which I&#x27;m forced to build a hut and so on. I&#x27;m sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it&#x27;s something I tire of within seconds.
And so it&#x27;s with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There&#x27;s a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair. Still, I just can&#x27;t do it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I &amp; II remasters. It&#x27;s crisp and readable, sure, but I&#x27;m never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. 
Anyway. Nowadays, I&#x27;d say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don&#x27;t pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta&#x27;s style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I&#x27;m no art scholar, and there&#x27;s undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don&#x27;t exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. 
Anyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard&#x27;s Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years.

                              <span>The Cabin Factory is described as a horror game but it&#x27;s sort of about deciding whether you are, in fact, playing a horror game. There is indeed a factory and it does indeed produce cabins - jolly, Center Parcs-style affairs made of big, merry logs, which roll up fully constructed on a conveyor belt. Your job is to enter and inspect them in first-person. What are you inspecting them for? Ghosts.

                              <span>Picking things up. Putting the things in boxes. Setting prices. Managing employees. Wiping the sweat from your creased brow and knowing, even if your meagre salary doesn’t get you very far, at least you put in an honest day’s graft to acquire it. All things done by pathetic fools that don’t realise the true CEO grindset actually involves no-wifing Diablo 4 all day and subsisting entirely off the the Lucozade-bottled urine of overworked drivers forced to make the agonising decision between self respect and continued employment. I might be conflating billionaires here.
Also, coincidentally, all things you can do in the demo for Beff Jezos Simulator. Now, work simulation games aren’t my absolute favourite. But, hey, I do love a good fantasy game. And what spellbinding vision of a farflung reality could be more fantastical than a game in which a billionaire actually does some work?

                              <span>Way back in June, treacherous, fickle Larian declared that Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 7 would be their final handover to players of the well-good D&amp;D RPG, with the focus then shifting internally to Larian&#x27;s two currently untitled new game projects. CEO Swen Vincke did, however, caveat that while the overall level of post-release support would be &quot;diminished&quot;, there would be a few more updates. We interpreted that to mean bug fixes and the like. Certainly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting brand new subclasses for every class in the game, which is what you&#x27;ll get with the just-announced Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 patch 8, together with new crossplay functionality and a full-figured photo mode.

                              <span>Dramacool emerged in the early 2010s, catering to pirates with a love for Asian dramas. The operation eventually drew an audience of millions but, in true drama fashion, announced its own demise this week. The site&#x27;s operators cite &#x27;copyright&#x27; as the reason and recent domain name troubles and pressure from Hollywood studios likely played a role.

I&#x27;m scheduling 24 advent calendar posts this week and then spending the rest of the year eating boxes of Cadbury Mini Yule Logs Triple Chocolate. So it&#x27;s no surprise that Devolver have announced their remaining slate of games aiming for release in 2024 are actually coming out in 2025.

The games that slipped are Baby Steps, Skate Story, and Stick It To The Stickman. Devolver released the news with typical style, via the 15th annual Devolver Delayed awards, which you can watch below.

                              <span>Slipways was the best grand strategy game I&#x27;d played in years, because it tossed out all the genre&#x27;s micromanagement in favour of a strategy puzzle where all your exploiting, expanding, et ceteraing could be squeezed into an hour&#x27;s play. That game began as a PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski before being polished to a fine shine in its full release.

All of which is just lead-in to talking about Solitomb, a solitaire-based dungeon crawler in which you fight demons by building hands of playing cards. It&#x27;s currently - heywaitaminute - a pay-what-you-want PICO-8 prototype by designer Jakub Wasilewski where &quot;all money earned goes towards making the bigger version possible.&quot; Like Slipways, it already seems like a frightfully clever piece of design.

                              <span>Announced last year, Exo Rally Championship does what the name suggests: takes the rugged, weather-battered terrain of Exo One&#x27;s interplanetary journey and replaces the ponderous plot and gravitational rise-and-fall spaceship movement with a six-wheel, space buggy rally competition. Or put another way, if Exo One was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Tiny Wings, then this is Colin McRae&#x27;s Interstellar.

Now there&#x27;s a demo, and it&#x27;s substantial with a tutorial, a 10 stage rally, and three &quot;ever-changing Daily Stages with online Steam leaderboards.&quot;

                              <span>I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we&#x27;re all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their &quot;ring of fire&quot;, I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.

                              <span>System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.
$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.

                              <span>It&#x27;s often claimed by liars and fools that our website&#x27;s title is a clever reference to the ancient Chinese game of shoushiling - or &quot;rock paper scissors&quot;, as it&#x27;s known overseas. The orthodox interpretation is that &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; is a folksy regional variation on this, with a &quot;shotgun&quot; instead of the &quot;scissors&quot;. But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!
The sad reality is that the origins of our website&#x27;s title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials. And in this endeavour, I will naturally need your aid.

                              <span>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former Mass Effect director Casey Hudson, closed doors without a game to their name. Now, sadly, it&#x27;s the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have &quot;paused operations&quot; after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.

                              <span>In hindsight, it’s surprising that it took so long for hardware manufacturers to start making &quot;gaming&quot; earbuds. If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?
Then again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers &#x27;round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.

                              <span>Half-Life 2 just got a small update, mostly to fix a long-running music bug. But hiding in the patch notes is an apology of sorts, a nod to that most tenacious of bunnyhopper: the Half-Life 2 speedrunner. It seems the recent 20th anniversary update for the classic first-person shooter messed with some beginner speedrun strategies by introducing an invisible wall to a big sewer pipe. Valve have now corrected that, removing the offending blocker and restoring order to the universe. Well, almost.

Here&#x27;s a creepy good &#x27;un: &quot;&#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. &#x27;Please, God, don&#x27;t let it look in the closet,&#x27; it parroted back from the next room.&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!
Silent Hill 2 remake’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. &quot;It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about horror is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings,&quot; she recently told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan.

                              <span>The Supreme Court has signaled its interest in a landmark case that could redefine anti-piracy enforcement. By calling on the Solicitor General to weigh in on the &quot;repeat infringer&quot; dispute between Cox Communications and several record labels, it has become more likely that the Supreme Court will eventually share its opinion on the &quot;billion dollar&quot; piracy controversy.

                              <span>Whereas some bits of games kit are in and out of the sales like they keep forgetting their keys there, The PlayStation 5 DualSense controller is one of those peripherals that just seems to hover around its £60 / $75 list price indefinitely. Which is a shame, as it’s a very, very good gamepad, including for PC playage. Consider these Black Friday week deals, then, as a rare opportunity to secure yourself said good gamepad without acquiescing to Sony’s stubbornness: it’s down to £40 in the UK and $54 in the US.

                              <span>If you&#x27;re playing a &quot;PS1-style&quot; game these days, odds are it&#x27;s a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io&#x27;s Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.
Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside &quot;existential grey&quot; is Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION, from New York City-based game designer Hatim Benhsain. It&#x27;s a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.

                              <span>Recently, PC games have been gorging themselves silly on our storage space. 160GB for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2? 190GB for God of War Ragnarok? If these games were people they’d stand waiting at the Pizza Hut buffet and nab ten of the twelve slices of Pepperoni Feast as soon as they’re slid under the heatlamps. What to do? For our part, there’s little we can do except upgrade capacity, and there are few better ways to do that on a budget than with the WD Blue SN580. It&#x27;s a cheap yet fast PCIe 4.0 SSD, which the Black Friday sales have knocked down to £47 / $55 for 1TB.

Just give me an approximate running total for the industry at large, so that whenever next a shiny-eyed producer regales me with the prospect of enchanted lazurite rapiers at a preview event, I can quietly ask how many enchanted lazurite rapiers we&#x27;re talking about, then open my laptop and generate a scrolling image akin to those comparison pages for stars and planets - a cosmic mountain of points and pommels, with the new game&#x27;s armoury forming a pixel-wide foothill in the bottom left corner. &quot;Are there not enough enchanted lazurite rapiers,&quot; I will kindly enquire, as the producer sobs brokenly into my shoulder.

                              <span>Sometimes a home only becomes a home when you leave. I recently moved out from a London flat I&#x27;d rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.
A few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year&#x27;s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger. Both find a focus in the figure of a matriarch who is kindly in one game, abusive in the other.

                              <span>When and where did the Steam demo for horror game New Life first find its way to me? When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. &quot;For who is madder?!&quot; I shout, in a normal and cool manner. &quot;The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!&quot;

                              <span>A studio led by former Mass Effect director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio&#x27;s closure on LinkedIn yesterday, saying that a &quot;shortfall of funding&quot; was responsible for the decision. They had been making a &quot;multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe&quot;, according to the studio&#x27;s website.

                              <span>Many are the horror games that involve you going down. Down is where much of the Badness in the world is traditionally located, after all, whether you&#x27;re talking about geology or psychology or theology. White Knuckle reverses the flow. You are already Down; by extrapolation, you must now go Up.
Possibly, you are Down because you are a manifestation of the aforementioned Badness. Possibly, the monstrous things trying to thwart your ascent are merely trying to stop you contaminating the surface world. Possibly, they are the Real Heroes. It doesn&#x27;t really matter, because you don&#x27;t have a choice. There is a wall of unspeakable flesh coming up the tunnel behind you. To avoid becoming part of it, you must climb.

Yet it’s usually been just a few tenners too expensive for me to say &quot;You, RPS reader, buy this&quot;, and since telling people what to buy is around 40% of this job, well, that just leaves a peripheral-shaped hole in my heart.

                              <span>&quot;James, please don’t just make half your Black Friday deal posts about Steam Deck stuff again&quot;, warns a steely-eyed Graham. &quot;I won’t&quot;, I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.

                              <span>The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game&#x27;s janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed &quot;A-life&quot; by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to &quot;emergent&quot; moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It&#x27;s just broken.

                              <span>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s &quot;in the grim darkness of the far future…&quot; tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.
Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:

                              <span>Microsoft have &quot;applied a compatibility hold&quot; to – i.e., blocked the installation of – a new Windows 11 update that’s causing havoc with certain Ubisoft games. Star Wars Outlaws, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora are among the weirdly publisher-specific victims of Windows 11 version 24H2, which by Microsoft’s admission (well spotted, Bleeping Computer) is causing crashes and crap performance in the affected games. Even after, in Outlaws’ case, Ubisoft responded to the complaints with their own patch.

                              <span>Manor Lords developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, has emerged from his keep with news of a forthcoming patch for the medieval city builder. It&#x27;ll add new maps, building upgrades and reworks for various economic systems.
The announcement post is mostly image-based, in keeping with the classic saying that &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words, as long as the words in question are mostly synonyms for &#x27;hut&#x27;, &#x27;mud&#x27;, &#x27;tree&#x27; and &#x27;mountain&#x27;&quot;. Fortunately, Styczeń threw in a few captions to light the way.

Literally, that’s what the streets are saying. “It’s good! A bit shonky, though!” opined my postman this morning, enunciating each syllable by yanking the package further from my grasp. “Don’t worry!” I said. “A patch for the FPS is coming next week”. “That’s cheered me right up, that has!

                              <span>The Maw doesn&#x27;t hibernate, but it does... decelerate. As the year fades, its seismic pulse slows from Gatling-gun prestissimo to howitzer larghissimo. Its compound eyes contract or dim or vanish entirely. Its limbs lengthen, forming contrails from the Arctic to Antarctica (what, did you think those were from planes? Haha. Hahahaha.) Accordingly, news writing becomes a kind of lullaby. Softly now - which promising new PC games are out this week?

                              <span>One of the most enduring online movie scams involves sites that claim to offer premium content, but turn out to be some type of scam. These services do not discriminate, so whether &#x27;customers&#x27; are pirates or just regular people hoping to buy content, everyone is a potential victim. The scam has been running for at least 20 years yet, seemingly out of nowhere, pro site-blocking studies now describe it as a major piracy-related security threat.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been working for a while on the next ScummVM release, and it is time for a call for public testing.
Support for a number of new engines and games for the existing ones was added, and we need your special attention to the following titles:
Orion Burger.
Total Eclipse and Total Eclipse 2.
Thimbleweed Park.
The Space Bar.
Moonbase Commander. (with multiplayer support)
Backyard Basketball.
Unrest.
Rise of the Dragon.
Castle Master.
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)
Mask Show. (Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik. (Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday. (Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы)
Besides these newly supported games, almost half of the current 108 engines have notable changes. Thus, testing more games is always a good thing.
All testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.
A detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.
We are looking forward to your reports about successful and unsuccessful playthroughs and bugs reported!

                              <span>That there are more than 100 entire PC games is a revelation as shocking as it is disturbing, but despite recently spending days translating Horace’s sonorous yawps into the list that eventually became our RPS 100, a chill silence recently befell the treehouse when we realised that some of our personal favourites had somehow been excluded. Determined to right this most heinous of wrongs, and armed with the conviction that no subjectivity be allowed to exist on the internet without at least one supplementary article of caveats, we’ve all put forth a single game that absolutely should have made the list. Consider the matter closed, then, at least until we all realise we’d actually like to do a 102nd pick each.

                              <span>Helldivers 2 developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo&#x27;s Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard&#x27;s Starcraft as an enemy faction. 
Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element&#x27;s, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.

                              <span>The mutant enemies in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it&#x27;s a common enough complaint to players of the first-person survival shooter that it&#x27;s already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers.

                              <span>Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you&#x27;re slinging is a &quot;solar-powered&quot; pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai&#x27;s debut didn&#x27;t result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp&#x27;s coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.

                              <span>Upon some serious soul searching following a little time with the early access build of open world game Vivat Slovakia, I have unfortunately had to admit to myself that it is probably not the GTA 6 killer I was hoping for. This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices. I’m not sure if you should play it, but I do feel enriched for learning of its existence. Here’s a trailer.

                              <span>Kill The Man In The House is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children&#x27;s book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there&#x27;s a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.

                              <span>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I&#x27;ve yet to play any of them. I likely won&#x27;t play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC via Steam soon.

                              <span>Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a &quot;shinobi and assassin arsenal&quot; of smoke bombs and bells.

There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for &#x27;double assassinations&#x27; again.

                              <span>Star Wars Outlaws&#x27; stealth has been much debated, though not hotly. Some people think it&#x27;s rubbish, some others think it&#x27;s basically fine. Ubisoft themselves seem to think it&#x27;s one of the key issues with the game, with the creative director previously saying the forced stealth sections are &quot;incredibly punishing&quot;.

Now there&#x27;s a new patch, apparently Outlaws&#x27; biggest yet, and stealth and combat are firmly in the crosshairs. The AI and player detection has changed; you can now choose combat in areas where it was previously not allowed; and enemies have had weak points added, for those who wish to cause massive damage.

Not for me the thrill of flushing out the true culprit (or culprits???) between visits to the exquisitely upholstered dining car, against the backdrop of passing mountains. The best I can hope for is getting chewed out for hogging the toilet on a crowded commuter train to Leeds.

                              <span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor&#x27;s wall in Toast of London.
Because your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.

That makes my usual new-game performance analysis/settings guide song and dance harder to pull off, with or without the appropriate soundtrack. Is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in such dire technical straits that we should wait for a few patches before giving it a shake? And how can its best settings be anointed if some, particularly FSR 3 frame generation, simply don’t work as they should?

In Avowed, you are the god-touched envoy of a distant emperor, sent to an island realm known as the Living Lands to investigate a mysterious blight. &quot;God-touched&quot;, in this case, means &quot;fungal and a bit mermaidy&quot;. It means that you can make rainbow toadstools sprout from your eyesocket in the character creator. It means that you can accessorise your cheekbones with what look like bracket polypores, or deck your ears with staghorn coral.

                              <span>Gang Beasts is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy&#x27;s head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.

                              <span>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn&#x27;t of me and my pal. No, it wasn&#x27;t of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn&#x27;t seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume together in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there&#x27;s a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It&#x27;s nice!

Buggier than Kafka&#x27;s Metamorphosis. In our S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review, wasteland wanderer James called it &quot;easily the most borked FPS I&#x27;ve played in years&quot;, detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly.

                              <span>Did last week&#x27;s paranormal body-swapper Slitterhead leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you&#x27;ll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you&#x27;re a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.
Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.

This is a bold, uncompromising survival FPS that can easily capture you for days on end – but I can’t invite you back into the Zone without hammering in a few hundred warning signs reading &quot;DANGER: BUGS&quot;. In Ukrainian, obviously.

Dark Math Games followed around lunchtime - they’re making a sexy Antarctic ski resort mystery called XXX Nightshift. Finally, there was Summer Eternal, the mouthiest and Marxiest of the lot, who have set themselves up as a workers co-operative and have yet to announce a specific project.

Later, the authorities who investigated the crash judged it was intentional - somebody in the cockpit had purposefully crashed the plane in an act of suicide, killing themselves and everyone on board. Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You&#x27;re piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash. The words that appear moments before this sequence are chilling in their simplicity: &quot;I hope this hurts.&quot;

The studio is owned by Bandai Namco and released the game about a month ago. The exact number of people out of work isn&#x27;t known, as Reflector haven&#x27;t made a public statement about it. (Update: A statement from Reflector says the layoffs amount to 18% of the total workforce). Among those affected are folks working in art, design, UI, lighting, and narrative.

                              <span>A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice sheds light on people&#x27;s motivations to use Z-Library. Expensive books and limited access to academic material play a key role among those surveyed. That includes a group of Chinese postgraduate students who believe that shadow libraries help to overcome (academic) poverty.

                              <span>A team of hackers from Brazil have taken first place in a hackathon organized by the country&#x27;s telecoms regulator. The challenge was to develop a solution to prevent non-approved &#x27;pirate&#x27; set-top devices from functioning in people&#x27;s homes. The team say they were able to remotely transfer code which completely disabled a target device. Once implemented, &quot;there will be a general failure in most of the irregular boxes in use,&quot; the hacker predicted.

Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)</span>

Indications that Brazil is already testing piracy blocking measures at the internet&#x27;s core routers is controversial, but if blocking is accurate and only targets pirate sites, criticism may be limited. With a new 250+ domain blocking wave implemented this week, let&#x27;s take a closer look at how things play out.

                              <span>A new survey from Norway reveals that 50% of young people under 30 believe that pirating content is an acceptable way to save money.  The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern.

                              <span>Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision.

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.


Existuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně &quot;zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!&quot; (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.
