                              <span>Back in February we posted a deal on Logitech&#x27;s K400 Bluetooth keyboard/trackpad combo device, which offered a convenient way to control Steam Deck, media PCs and other gizmos that don&#x27;t come with built-in desktop-friendly controls.
Today we&#x27;re back with a similar deal on the Logitech Wireless Starter Kit, which bundles a K380 keyboard and M185 mouse for ¬£40 (down from ¬£50). Both elements are surprisingly high-quality for the price, with a nicer-looking and better-feeling scissor switch keyboard with circular keycaps and a compact 2.4GHz mouse that provides better speed and accuracy than a trackpad.

                              <span>The revised digital Pok√©mon card game sets a launch date
The Pokemon Company has locked in a full launch date for its new digital card game platform.¬†Pokemon TCG Live will fully launch on June 8 for both PC and mobile, with¬†TCG Online¬†sunsetting as part of the process.
This new app is The Pokemon Company&#x27;s updated way to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game online. Announced back in 2021, the app has been in open beta for a little while now and is finally setting a full launch date.
Pokemon TCG Live¬†can be picked up through the App Store, Google Play Store, or the TCG website for their respective platforms. The company is also hosting a celebration ahead of next expansion&#x27;s launch.¬†Paldea Evolved¬†will be playable starting on June 8 in¬†TCG Live, but players who log in between May 2 and June 6 will get some special accessories and cosmetics.

This also means the original¬†Pokemon Trading Card Game Online¬†app will be removed from mobile and PC on June 5, at 9 a.m. PT. Accounts use the same Trainer club account log-in, and you can read up on how to migrate those over here.
The heart of the cards
As someone who already collects Pokemon cards but doesn&#x27;t really play the actual competitive card game (I just like the cool art, okay), this update feels a little targeted at me. I&#x27;ve only played a little bit of TCG Live, but it&#x27;s definitely a visual upgrade, and there are systems in place to encourage learning.
I&#x27;m still hungry for the days of the¬†Pokemon Trading Card Game¬†on the Game Boy, which Arceus willing, will hit Nintendo Switch Online at some point. But hey, maybe I&#x27;ll run a bunch of code cards through the¬†TCG Live¬†service and see if I can rekindle the card game flame.

Get your card shuffler ready. Sunshine Shuffle, the narrative poker game from the creators of An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs, is on its way for a May 24, 2023 release date.
Sunshine Shuffle is a fusion of storytelling and poker. You climb aboard the S.S. Sunshine and play poker with a capybara and other less interesting critters. The twist is that these cute creatures took part in a bank heist. As long as you pony up and put your chips on the line, they‚Äôre willing to let you in on the details.

As a warning, the soundtrack apparently consists of ska. I don‚Äôt have an issue with the genre, but some people talk about it like it‚Äôs an auditory disease. I‚Äôd probably start breaking things if a game played modern, pop-country at me, so I feel a warning is fair.
I like the idea of a narrative poker game more so than I would a game that is just poker. Years of rotting my brain with video games means I can‚Äôt sit still for ten seconds without ample visual feedback. Poker Night at the Inventory toyed around with the idea by having various video game and video game adjacent characters banter at the table. Additionally, I‚Äôd really like to know how such a regal, perfect creature like the capybara could be driven to crime.
You can find out all the sordid details in¬†Sunshine Shuffle on May 24, 2023 on PC or Switch. Or both. I‚Äôm not your game mom.

If you remember that a new Saints Row game came out in the summer of last year, then you might be pleased to hear that the open-world adventure&#x27;s first DLC expansion will finally arrive next week, nine months on from the game&#x27;s initial release on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.
The Heist and The Hazardous ‚Äî which hits all platforms on May 9 ‚Äî will see our uber-trendy gangsters on a mission of vengeance, tracking down the double-crossing Hollywood star Chris Hardy following a botched assignment. The expansion will feature new in-game events, story missions, and a wardrobe full of new clothing, weapons, and other related chicanery. The Heist and The Hazardous is the first of three paid DLC expansions planned for the title in 2023.

Saints Row, which launched last August after being delayed from its initial spring release date, saw the tongue-in-cheek crime franchise rebooted with an oddly elite fashion aesthetic and a cast of younger, entrepreneurial stars. While the game itself was serviceable, with high-octane action and an appetite for destruction, many critics and fans were non-plussed at the reboot&#x27;s general vibe, complaining about a dated mission design, obnoxious and offputting dialogue, as well as a slew of technical issues.
Developer Volition has been releasing updates to correct the latter problems, which has led to this long delay between launch and DLC drops. Soon after release, it was announced that Volition was being transferred from Deep Silver to another Embracer Group publisher, Gearbox Entertainment.
Saints Row is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. But not Stadia. Not anymore.

                              <span>Hope there&#x27;s a Homer comeback
Square Enix has announced a release date for In Tanta We Trust, the DLC expansion for its mythical adventure title Forspoken ‚Äî The new campaign content will arrive May 26 on PC and PS5.
While the action-packed trailer doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of context, we can see that Frey Holland, now truly coming to terms with the incredible powers afforded her in the kingdom of Athia, has been seemingly joined on the battlefield by no less than Tanta Cinta herself. The two magic-infused warriors will face new enemies and threats as they search for a way to purge Athia of the energy-sucking anomaly known as &quot;The Break&quot;. Players can expect an extension to Athia&#x27;s already huge map, as well as new spells, skills, friends and foes. Will we get new cat familiars? I hope so.

Am I going to die on the Forspoken defense hill? No, I am not, the moment has passed and fate has made its decision. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I agree with all of the flack directed towards what was, essentially, a perfectly fine adventure with some excellent stand-out setpieces and some lovely world and character design. While hardly the most original of open-world adventures, I really liked the synergetic combat, I really liked the costuming and special effects, and... fact is... I really liked Frey.
In Tanta We Trust will, quite possibly, be the last we ever hear from the Forspoken franchise, given its disappointing sales, and combined with the fact that developer Luminous Productions has essentially been assimilated into Square Enix proper. If so, I hope that Frey, Athia, and, of course, Homer, are all given a fitting finale that sends the audience home happy.
Forspoken is available now on PS5 and PC. In Tanta We Trust will launch on May 26.

There&#x27;s more on the way for Insomniac&#x27;s take on Spider-Man, and now, the remastered version of the original is getting its own release. Insomniac Games is releasing a standalone version of¬†Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered on PlayStation 5 sometime later this month.
Originally, the remastered version of 2018&#x27;s¬†Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man was only available as a part of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition. Now, there will be an option to get Peter&#x27;s adventure all by itself for PlayStation 5 owners.

The quality of The Blue Blur&#x27;s games might be hit or miss, but one thing that&#x27;s consistent with the Sonic the Hedgehog¬†series is its outstanding music. Some of the best¬†Sonic¬†songs excite us as blast through each stage at supersonic speed, battle bosses, and gaze at the wonderful visuals surrounding the hedgehog.
From fully vocal tracks like &quot;Escape from the City&quot; to the nostalgic 16-bit themes of &quot;Green Hill Zone,&quot; there are practically hundreds of compositions to choose from for this list. And so, chili dog in hand, let&#x27;s listen to the 10 best Sonic¬†songs in the series&#x27; history.

                              <span>Looking ahead to the summer
Microsoft is locking in all the details for its summer showcase plans. The publisher now has both a date and time set for its Xbox Games Showcase and the Starfield Direct that will follow after.
The Xbox double feature will air on June 11 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. It will stream out over Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, and have an ASL stream option available as well.
https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1653754086372818944
What&#x27;s it showing? Well, for the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft is making it sound like there will be some announcements. There will be &quot;new surprises and first-looks&quot; from its internal studios, as well as partners from around the world. The showcase will also discuss games coming to Xbox, PC, and to Game Pass.
As for the Starfield Direct, well, it&#x27;s going to be about¬†Starfield. Bethesda&#x27;s big RPG is still a ways off, but getting closer every day. Xbox says there will be tons of new gameplay and developer interviews.
Then, on June 13, Microsoft will air the Xbox Games Showcase Extended at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. This stream will host some interviews based around the news from the showcase,¬† as well as game updates.
The summer game showcases draw near
We&#x27;re only a few days into May, but the time period for summer streams and news is now just a month away. The PC Gaming Show is set to follow right after the Xbox showcase, Ubisoft is airing its 2023 Forward the day after, and the Summer Game Fest kick-off stream will air on June 8.
Though Nintendo, Sony, and a few other companies still have yet to lock in any summer plans as of this writing, the summer&#x27;s already starting to stack up. Even in a year without E3, it seems like June will have some news and announcements in store.
It will be interesting to see what Xbox brings to its summer games showcase event, especially as Redfall¬†didn&#x27;t land quite so well for some folks. We&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s in store on June 11.

                              <span>Hug a tree
THQ Nordic has announced that furry open-world exploration game Biomutant will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.
Biomutant originally launched on other platforms on May 21, 2021. It drops you and your hideously ugly fursona in a post-apocalyptic world where your goal is to maybe save the world tree if you think that‚Äôs a good idea. For the most part, it was very open-world and put an emphasis on crafting and exploration.
I liked it. Maybe one of the few, I think. I enjoyed the exploration, thought the world presented a nice amount of variety, and the crafting system is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. Not only could you build weapons, you could take them apart and make them into better weapons. I don‚Äôt need to excuse myself for liking a game that other people bounced off of, but if I wanted to, 2021 was absolutely depressing. Any spark of joy just glowed brighter.
I‚Äôm not really sure how this is going to look on Switch. It uses Unreal Engine 4, which has built-in compatibility with the Switch. However, I feel like you‚Äôre going to need to substantially cut back on the vegetation and fur, and I‚Äôm not sure a naked version of Biomutant is going to look so hot. Still, gameplay-wise, it should be the same. We‚Äôre pretty far removed from the days when games needed to be scaled back to fit on handheld.
Biomutant is currently available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.

Every day we read stories about the potential (inevitable?) end of human creativity due to advances in AI. But meanwhile, in the Czech Republic, a brand new developer is creating a game utilizing embroidered animation, hand-painted backgrounds, and traditional musical instruments.
It&#x27;s titled Scarlet Deer Inn, and it is being produced by Attu Games. This studio consists of a husband and wife team that decided they wanted to craft a video game entirely in-house, and I&#x27;ve never wanted to cheer someone on more. While Eva and Lukas Navratilova have been tweeting about their game since 2021, it&#x27;s a recent Twitter post that seems to be catching the internet&#x27;s attention.

Modus Games and Secret Base are teaming up to beat Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons right into our faces this summer.
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons brings back the brothers Lee, as well as a couple more dragons to make quadruple dragons. Marian joins the brothers, after becoming tired of bad guys constantly carrying her off. Meanwhile, I hope Uncle Matin is actually their uncle. There‚Äôs reportedly going to be a total of 13 playable characters, but the gameplay only supports two-player local coop. That‚Äôs probably a bummer for a lot of people, but I‚Äôm okay with it. I don‚Äôt like playing games with people who are out of Charlie Horse range.
The big combat change here is that it‚Äôs all ‚Äútag team combat.‚Äù You select two characters and can switch between them freely. There are co-op combos and other moves to pull off between your pair.
https://youtu.be/TVvlBr6hVXA
Secret Base is best known for Streets of Red: Devil‚Äôs Dare Deluxe. They‚Äôre applying a twist to the main campaign of Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. You select the order you&#x27;ll tackle the levels, and that will affect the length and difficulty of the following stages. You can also gain cash by performing special KOs and upgrade your fighter.
This is, by my count, the dozenth return of the series following 2012‚Äôs Double Dragon Neon and 2017‚Äôs Double Dragon IV. Secret Base seems to be bringing their own style to the series, so it should stand out from other revivals. I dig the art style, and the animations really pop.
We won‚Äôt have to wait long, as Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons releases this summer on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Devolver Digital has announced that its fantasy gunslingin&#x27; adventure Weird West is to receive a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X platforms next week, bringing Wolfeye Studios&#x27; strange frontier of cowboys and monsters to the ninth generation of gaming.
Released in the spring of 2022, Weird West is an anthology title that tells the story of five distinct characters, each forced to face a bizarre and twisted version of America&#x27;s formative period. Utilizing a top-down perspective and with a heavy emphasis on exploration, combat, and environmental interaction, Weird West was praised for its pulpy writing, creepy character design, and interesting world, though some of its action and technical elements gave critics pause.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;0NS3lzv0Nw4&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;DevolverDigital
Weird West: Definitive Edition will see the game launch on modern platforms, boasting new 4K resolution options and running at 60 FPS. Hopefully, with these visual upgrades and the power of Gen 9, some of the game&#x27;s stiffer creases will be ironed out. Here&#x27;s hoping, as Weird West is certainly charming in its own peculiar way, and any fans of alternate realities, old-school horror comics, or twin-stick action would do well to test the murky waters of Wolfeye&#x27;s adventure.
Weird West: Definitive Edition launches May 8 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. It is already available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One in its standard form. Devolver has not yet confirmed a free upgrade option.

                              <span>Trapped in another house
Vertical Reach and publisher Armor Games Studios have announced that their puzzle-focused retro horror title, The Tartarus Key, is chambered for a May 31, 2023 release.
Putting you in the shoes of the hapless Alex Young, The Tartarus Key takes place in a bizarre mansion where doors are locked with all manner of puzzles. Lifting the aesthetics of the PS1, it promises a horror experience without the use of jump-scares. That&#x27;s a fairly common goal for horror games. Hopefully, they can pull off the scares without all the jump.

The Tartarus Key reminds me somewhat of the recent Madison, which is itself part of the emerging escape-the-room sub-genre. I don‚Äôt mean that as a bad thing. I‚Äôm just bringing it up as a matter of classification. In one of my guide-writing gigs, I would sometimes be tapped to tackle puzzle games like this since, apparently, I have a mind for it. That, or the editor just really liked pumping up my ego. And it worked! I feel like a boss!
There are three different endings to find. You have the option to either rescue your fellow captives or leave them to their fate. We‚Äôll see how annoying they are. If we‚Äôre talking something like the SNES‚Äô SOS, where everyone else sucks, then maybe they should just be eaten by the house. The only NPCs worth saving are the dudes from Metal Slug.

In any case, I‚Äôm looking forward to checking out The Tartarus Key to see if anyone is worth saving.
The Tartarus Key is coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on May 31, 2023.

                              <span>Showdown with Lili &amp; Salt on the cards?
While Capcom&#x27;s upcoming scrapper Street Fighter 6 is already getting chests puffed out and shoulders heaved way ahead of its June launch, fans from all walks of life seemed to take time out yesterday from all the smack-talkin&#x27;, hitboxin&#x27; controversies to collectively fall in love with Delta Red agent Cammy White and, in particular, her new cat pal.
Cammy, who has been depicted as having an affinity for moggies ever since her 1994 Super Street Fighter II debut, takes her love of feline friends one step further in Street Fighter 6, with an as-yet-unnamed kitty that appears with her on the character selection screen, chilling out and wanting food, because all cats are constantly hungry 24/7.
https://twitter.com/ChrisxMoyse/status/1653314827295637507?s&#x3D;20
However, in a clip captured by myself during my recent playtime with a full build of SF6, We see Cammy&#x27;s kitty has taken to interrupting her glory moments, leaping onto the battlefield mid-fight in order to brush up to her and Demand Pets. While Cammy&#x27;s trademark stoicism is apparent, she cannot help herself, and squats down to stroke Mr. Mittens, (my name, not Capcom&#x27;s), before regaining her deadly composure for the next round.
The video has been extremely popular, with even Cammy&#x27;s own voice actor Caitlin Glass declaring her love for Street Fighter&#x27;s new four-legged superstar. One cannot help but wonder whether Cammy and her friend must now do battle with Tekken&#x27;s Lili and her new moggie, Salt. This is the real reason we need to see the return of Tekken vs. Street Fighter. A gen-you-ine Meow Mix.
Street Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Please take some time to check out my preview of the full build. A look at the terrifying online tyrant, JP,¬†The 50 things I loved about the beta, as well as my 10 suggestions for DLC characters.

Park Beyond is not just a complex theme park management sim, or a physics-ish coaster builder (although it is both of those), it&#x27;s also an anti-physics weird-ride expando-game, allowing you to unlock increasingly unrealistic upgrades for rides in a process the developers Limbic Entertainment call &quot;impossification&quot;.

                              <span>RTS-FPS hybrids aren&#x27;t a new thing, but they also haven&#x27;t been the most historically successful ventures. Well, Arma 3 developers Bohemia Interactive are taking a punt at blending the two genres with Silica, in the hopes that you can both shoot and command things with equal levels of good. It&#x27;s the first project to hatch from Bohemia&#x27;s incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.
Silica is largely the work of one developer, Martin &quot;Dram&quot; Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia&#x27;s Take On Mars. Having given Silica a whirl for over an hour, I struggle to see whether the RTS, FPS hybrid can truly offer the best of both worlds. It does, however, make being a crab extremely good.

This time we&#x27;re chatting about our biggest Steam sins. That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre revealing it all: shamefully ignored indie gems, outrageous playtimes, and games that we promise we‚Äôll return to one day, honest! We also get into what we‚Äôve been recently playing and then end, as always, with our hyperfixations.

We named Jump Over The Age&#x27;s dystopian RPG one of our favourite games of 2022 last year, and seeing as the game is also celebrating its first anniversary this month, it&#x27;s the perfect time to return the rag-tag world of Erlin&#x27;s Eye.

                              <span>Persona is a series with plenty of choice as you balance your alternate dimension demon-slaying responsibilities with your high-schooling social life. Playing as a student, you&#x27;re free to decide how to spend your free time, which characters to spend it with, and who to inevitably romance by the end of the game. Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist‚Äôs gender in the series. Until now. Thanks to the simply titled ‚ÄúP5R Female Protagonist‚Äù mod, you can now replace the default male protagonist Joker in Persona 5 Royal with a she/her Joker. On paper, that would seem like a novel change in a lot of games, but in the mammoth-sized Persona 5, a change like that requires some very impressive modding.

                              <span>The new Apex Legends season, Arsenal, looks exciting from watching the new trailer. The 17th season is set to launch on May 9th, and features new character Ballistic, a competitor in the Apex Games&#x27; predecessor the Thunderdome Games, now making a comeback as the new legend. The popular World&#x27;s Edge map is also getting some healing, and there&#x27;s an Apex Museum within the map that celebrates Apex&#x27;s past, present, and future. Although the theme for this season seems to be nostalgia, there are still some new features to look forward to, particularly the updates to the weapon system and upgraded Firing Range.

It&#x27;s the Cooler Master SK622, a gaming-optimised 60% design that offers low profile switches, a UK layout (with optional RGB backlighting) and the flexibility of wired (USB-C), Bluetooth and lower-latency 2.4GHz wireless.
The CM SK622 retailed for over ¬£100 back in the day, but now it&#x27;s available for half-price: ¬£49.98. That&#x27;s an awesome deal for any mechanical keyboard, much less one from a name brand with wireless connectivity!

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) launched a new awareness campaign today hoping to educate kids on the risks of using the internet. The government&#x27;s decision to call the campaign &quot;CyberFlix&quot; is utterly bewildering. Not only does the campaign now share the same name as one of the most recognized movie piracy apps, but the first few pages of Google results only return piracy-related results, at least some of which lead to malware.

                              <span>Planet¬†of Lana, the narrative sci-fi puzzle platformer with Studio Ghibli vibes, got a surprise release date today, and it‚Äôs just a couple of weeks away.¬†
On May 23, players can embark on an adventure as Lana, joined by her cat-like companion, Mui, to rescue her sister. The game is set in an alien world teeming with strange creatures and dangerous robots, which Lana and Mui overcome by working together to solve platforming puzzles or sneaking unseen in stealth. Planet of Lana occupies a similar space as games like Limbo and Inside, though with a decidedly more vibrant presentation. Check out its new trailer below.¬†


Planet of Lana was first unveiled at E3 2021 and is being developed by Wishfully and Thunderful. It was originally supposed to launch last year before suffering a delay.¬†The game is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. It will be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</span>

                              <span>PlayStation has announced that a standalone version of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered will hit PlayStation 5 later this month.¬†
Previously, Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered was only available by purchasing the Ultimate Edition of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Later this month, anyone will be able to play Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered. Players will be able to purchase it standalone or, if you own Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man on PlayStation 4 (or its Digital Deluxe Edition or Game of the Year Edition), then you can pay $10 to upgrade to Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered on PS5.¬†
This remaster is perhaps most famous for introducing a redesigned face for Peter Parker, but it also includes The City That Never Sleeps expansion starring Black Cat as well as some exclusive Spidey suits, such as those from Spider-Man: No Way Home.¬†
Owners of Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales can still obtain Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man Remastered by upgrading to the Ultimate Edition through the main menu of the PS5 version of the game. If you&#x27;re looking to buy the remastered game standalone, it will cost you $49.99.¬†
PlayStation says this standalone version and upgrade path is coming later this month, but it doesn&#x27;t say exactly when.¬†

                              <span>Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.
Set in New York City after it‚Äôs been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won‚Äôt be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers‚Äô old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield.¬†


According to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts ‚Äúseamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.‚Äù Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update).¬†
Double Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses.¬†
Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It&#x27;s¬†coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</span>

Earlier this year, the company showcased various games, including Redfall and the shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush, at an¬†Xbox and Bethesda Direct in January. Microsoft said at the time that a standalone Starfield show was in the works to &quot;dedicate the proper amount of time for a deep dive&quot; into the game, and now we know when that&#x27;s happening: June 11, immediately after the June 11 Xbox Games Showcase.¬†

The Breath of the Wild soundtrack might have been something of a departure for the Zelda series with its grand themes and sweeping scores replaced by something a little more subtle, but there are still some top-notch tunes to be heard in there.
Many of us have been listening to the soundtrack on repeat in the run-up to Tears of the Kingdom, but this recent concert from the Ensemble G.A.P. orchestra in Japan is a pretty darn good reason to blast those themes all over again (thanks, Siliconera).

Believe it or not, Pok√©mon GO has been around for almost seven years now, having launched back in July 2016 (almost a full year before the Switch!). It always seemed inevitable, then, that interest in the app would eventually wane.
Well, it seems that time may well be upon us, as according to MobileGame.biz (thanks, VGC), Pok√©mon GO&#x27;s monthly earnings for April 2023 were significantly lower than that of March, which itself was a poor month compared to February. The app brought in a total of $34.7 million during April, $42.8 million in March, and $58 million in February, meaning the drop over the course of two months is a rather severe 40%.

THQ Nordic has today announced that it is bringing Experiment 101&#x27;s Biomutant to the Switch, with a release planned for later this year.
Biomutant was released back in 2021 on the PS4 and Xbox One to mediocre reviews before getting a next-gen update the following year. We don&#x27;t know whether the game is going to be tweaked in any way for the Switch at the moment, so we are assuming that it is going to be the same combat-focused open-world adventure.

                              <span>Prematurely hatched.
Ever since Nintendo gave players the tools to develop their own levels with Super Mario Maker, there‚Äôs been talk about the Big N expanding the concept to other franchises, especially Zelda. This was allegedly discussed at greater length behind the scenes and eventually led to the addition of the Chamber Dungeons concept in the Link‚Äôs Awakening Switch remake, but there seemingly wasn‚Äôt enough will or interest to see it through to a fuller product, as we haven‚Äôt seen anything come to fruition yet. Spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the potential of this idea, an indie team called Firechick launched and successfully funded a Kickstarter late last year for a legally distinct top-down Zelda-style dungeon builder called Super Dungeon Maker. Now that it‚Äôs come to Switch, we can report that it‚Äôs a decent foundation, though it feels unfinished at launch and there‚Äôs clear room for improvement here.
First, a brief overview. This is a game that apes the gameplay of the Game Boy and SNES Zelda games as closely as possible, right down to that annoying worm boss that spins in circles in a cramped room. Instead of playing as Link, you play as a chicken named Fink who has the same basic sword and shield alongside a small arsenal of tools like a hookshot or bombs. Using these, you navigate dungeons, solve puzzles, and kill baddies, all in the quest to find the golden egg at the end of each dungeon.

It&#x27;s been a while since we last heard from the arcade-inspired baseball series, Super Mega Baseball, but thanks to a new official reveal trailer, we now know that the fourth entry in the franchise will be swinging its way onto Switch from 2nd June.
Super Mega Baseball 4 continues much of what we have seen before, bringing over 200 baseball legends back to the field in a chunky, big-head visual style. This time around, the game has received some fresh new animations and stadiums, improved in-game audio and soundtrack, and a couple of more tweaks for good luck.

Are you a fan of Shovel Knight? How about Mega Man? If you&#x27;ve answered &quot;yes&quot; to either of those questions, then you may be entitled to compens... Wait, no, that&#x27;s not right.
If you&#x27;ve answered &quot;yes&quot;, then we&#x27;ve a feeling you&#x27;re going to love Bat Boy, an 8-bit action-platformer from X PLUS Games that takes everything great from Shovel Knight and Mega Man and lumps it all into a neat little package that frankly looks awesome.

We know that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is going to be set in the same Hyrule that we have each spent many, many hours exploring in Breath of the Wild. Sure, we imagine that there are going to be a fair number of tweaks (hi Sky Islands!), but it looks like the basic skeleton is the same. So, what&#x27;s the best way to prepare for this return? Replay the first game? Stare longingly at the map? Get yourself a horse and head out on a real-life adventure on your own? You could do all of the above, or you could have a crack at HyruleGuessr, a BOTW-set map quiz (thanks, Polygon) ‚Äî it&#x27;s your call...

2023 promises to be a good year for League of Legends fans (at least, for those who are excited about spinoffs). We heard of two upcoming titles back in the hazy days of 2021 ‚Äî Convergence and Song of Nunu ‚Äî and we now know that the former is heading our way in just a few weeks on 23rd May.
The League of Legends franchise has never been against genre jumping in its spinoffs ‚Äî just look at the turn-based RPG Ruined King from a few years back, or even the action-focussed The Mageseeker from last month ‚Äî and Convergence is no exception.

If you&#x27;re a fan of fun little arcade racers, then Minit Fun Racer should really be a no-brainer.
Out now for a measly $2.99 / ¬£2.69, the game will see you weaving between traffic on an adorable little scooter as you gather coins, soar through the air, and accomplish a variety of unique goals along the way. The best part, though, is that all proceeds from the game will go directly to charity.

                              <span>Is there worse box art than that for the first Age Of Wonders, back in 1999? Probably - but I still wouldn&#x27;t have seen it and bet on the series continuing 24 years later. 

Yet here we are. Age Of Wonders 4 is out today.

                              <span>Each game in the Super Mega Baseball series strips the sport back to its fundamentals: pitching, batting, and making its big-headed players cry. That makes it a baseball series that someone with no understanding of the sport can enjoy - and I would know.

Now Super Mega Baseball 4 has been announced, and for the first time it&#x27;s got a roster of pros to play with - or former pros, at least.

As of today, any Game Pass subscriber can offer up to five friends a 14-day free trial to PC Game Pass. So I guess it&#x27;s time to bug your friends.

Having played the vampiric FPS for a clutch of hours now, I&#x27;d say it feels more like an &quot;absence&quot;. Arkane&#x27;s latest strikes me as an open world shooter with a few simple strands that never seem to go anywhere. Occasionally, there are flashes of a team that - as we all know - are capable of brilliance, but Redfall has me following a path of irritation, and feeling a slight sadness for what might&#x27;ve been.

The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director‚Äôs chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.


Together, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm spoiled,‚Äù said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. ‚ÄúI worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They‚Äôre the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.‚Äù It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.

That makes it often an aggressively priced SSD compared to others at similar speeds, and today Box are offering the 2TB model for just ¬£77.50. That&#x27;s the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever seen for a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD and a deal worth writing up, IMO.

                              <span>Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns may be a turn-based tactics game first and foremost, but it also has a substantial RPG element that drives both the story and the interpersonal dramas of its superhero teams between missions. When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It&#x27;s a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. 
&quot;It&#x27;s crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they&#x27;re three hours long. That&#x27;s as long as a movie,&quot; he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals &quot;we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.&quot;

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor‚Äôs PC has had a particularly bumpy launch on PC with our hardware boss James concluding that ‚Äúsluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects.‚Äù EA have now released their first post-launch patch, aiming to fix a host of issues.

                              <span>I first played co-op third-person shooter Glitch Busters: Stuck On You at Summer Games Fest last year, and came away really impressed. I played with couch co-op with two members of developers Toy Logic, which was lighthearted, slightly chaotic fun; everything couch co-op should be, right?
So, I thought I&#x27;d give the game a whirl but as a solo player. How would a game built for up to four players cope when there&#x27;s just one person taking the reins? Well, sort of fine for a bit, then quite agonising, actually. That&#x27;s not to say it can&#x27;t be a fun time, but bots definitely aren&#x27;t a substitute for real people.

And every Monday (or Tuesday, after a holiday weekend like this), I bring you a selection of these snaps and clips. This week, my eye has been caught by weird musical contraptions, a quiet moment on the balcony with a cup of coffee, chill building, frozen sledding, and the ability to skip a game&#x27;s tutorial so hard that it sinks to the bottom of the sea. Come admire all these interesting and attractive indies with me!

Yep, embroidered as in using needles, thread, and fabric to stitch together every animation in real life, from the protagonist&#x27;s big jump to a sheep‚Äôs wagging tail. This stitching is then scanned into the game by developers Attu Games, creating a uniquely beautiful platformer with a slightly physical touch.

                              <span>In the incredibly rare circumstance that you might have had a Kinder Egg as a kid, was the toy ever your favourite part? It sure wasn‚Äôt for me. I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I‚Äôd crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, ‚ÄúOh, an elephant!‚Äù, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I‚Äôm currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6‚Äôs World Tour mode. It&#x27;s available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I&#x27;ve been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can&#x27;t say it left much of impression.
In case you&#x27;re equally bemused by what SF6&#x27;s World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‚Äòem! There‚Äôs a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate.

If there‚Äôs two things I love, it‚Äôs wrestling and cuddling. Both of these things are already very adjacent, but Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid on the Block is looking to flying elbow-drop them into one sexy package.
The sequel to Team Lazerbeam‚Äôs 2016 indie title, Wrestling With Emotions: New Kid on the Block looks to continue the team‚Äôs weird take on love and suplexes, and it‚Äôs everything I want it to be. It‚Äôs got meat, it has all types of hunks, and it‚Äôs about rugged embraces and tender smooches. It‚Äôs what wrestling is all about!
And now, there‚Äôs a demo, and after playing it, I can confirm that this is the next big thing in big things.

As one of¬†Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns&#x27; delays, Firaxis had pushed the hero strategy game and also further delayed some console versions of it. While the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions arrived last December, the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions fell back.

Video game composer Ryo Nagamatsu announced that they have left Nintendo following a 17-year tenure that saw them produce music for titles franchises including Splatoon, Mario Kart, Super Mario, and Smash Bros.
Speaking in a succinct message on Twitter, Ryo Nagamatsu implied that he has left Nintendo (amicably) in order to spread his creative wings a little further across the industry.
&quot;I have made a decision to leave the company of April 30, 2023,&quot; writes Nagamatsu. &quot;I will work a little wider and more directly to help those who need my help and to help the industry. Thank you all for your kind support! I look forward to serve you in the future! (an amicable settlement)&quot;
Joining the studio in 2006, Nagamatsu plied his trade on some of the biggest releases for Nintendo platforms, composing music for Wii releases Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Wii Sports Resort. 3DS titles The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Party: Star Rush, and in more recent years oversaw music composition and voice recordings for Switch titles Splatoon 3, Mario Party Superstars, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
We can very likely look forward to hearing his exciting and evocative compositions in future works.

Another Riot Forge production is on the way, this time exploring the world of¬†League of Legends&#x27; Ekko.¬†Converegence: A League of Legends Story¬†is a 2D action platformer starring the time-and-space-travelling fighter, and it arrives on May 23, 2023.
Developed by¬†Speed Brawl¬†studio Double Stallion Games,¬†Convergence¬†follows Ekko as he deals with a threat to the city of Zaun. From today&#x27;s trailer, it looks like Ekko will be interacting with his future self, as well as rewinding time in the short-term too, in order to foil some catastrophe.

Convergence&#x27;s platforming and action also makes use of Ekko&#x27;s unique time abilities. From gaining an advantage over foes to rewinding a missed jump, it definitely feels like something¬†Prince of Persia: Sands of Time¬†should be keeping an eye on.
The story follows Ekko through the undercity of Zaun too, so¬†Arcane¬†fans should get a little bit more out of this than other locales. But of course, there are champions to fight too. Alongside Ekko, three other champions have been confirmed: Jinx, Camille, and Warwick.
Time after time
It feels like only yesterday that¬†The Mageseeker, the latest Riot Forge production, came out. While that one followed the magical rebellion happening within Demacia, Ekko&#x27;s exploits in Zaun will be a bit different, both in setting and gameplay.
All of these, as well as the upcoming¬†Song of Nunu, are part of Riot Games&#x27; publishing arm Forge. The idea has been to expand the world of¬†League of Legends¬†through third-party projects, and so far, it seems like it&#x27;s been doing alright. Games like¬†The Mageseeker¬†and¬†Ruined King¬†were solid, fresh approaches to Runeterra. Maybe the streak can keep up with¬†Convergence.
Convergence: A League of Legends Story¬†goes live for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 23.

Square Enix has announced that its blocktastic range of releases known as the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has now surpassed two million total sales across PC, console, and mobile platforms.
The range of classic RPGs first launched on PC and mobile platforms in the summer of 2021, drip feeding each title over the course of the following six months. The entire collection finally arrived on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch just last month, and consists of legendary releases Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V and, you guessed it, Final Fantasy VI. The new console reports have received praise from both critics and fans alike.

Each release sees the games that defined a genre sharpened up for modern displays, while retaining the nostalgic and warmth-inducing sprites and environments of their 8-bit and 16-bit roots, overseen by original artist Kazuko Shibuya. Audio has been restored by composer Nobuo Uematsu, and a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug fixes have been made to the releases, fixing issues that have existed ‚Äî in some cases ‚Äî for nigh-on four decades. The console editions of the games include the option to switch to each title&#x27;s classic soundtrack, as well as utilize an easier-on-the-eyes &quot;pixel font&quot;.
The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is available now on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android platforms.

Torture Star Video has announced the next game from Bloodwash duo Black Eyed Priest and Henry Hoare, Sniper Killer. The short-form horror game is due for release on PC sometime in 2023.
The twist in Sniper Killer is that you control both the eponymous sharpshooter and a detective trying to stop them. While the sniper has the goal of simply delivering high-caliber snacks into the faces of their victims, Detective Comardy is searching for clues and trying to end the killings. The information on it suggests that the detective is a past-his-prime burnout, which I can definitely relate to.
https://youtu.be/Q4h117kC1J0
The last game from the duo was Night at the Gates of Hell, which was a fun, tacky zombie shooter. In my review, I noted that ‚ÄúIt gives a strong impression that the developer had as much fun creating it as you will have playing it,‚Äù which is a sentiment that still sounds accurate to me.
Meanwhile, Bloodwash was a slow-cooker slasher title. I found that one to be extremely inventive in that most of the game was spending time while waiting for your laundry to finish. You could literally just sit and wait. But it was more fun to wander around the shopping plaza, learning about the murders that have been going on.
Being the victim in short-form lo-fi horror risks getting stale after a few years of iterating on it. However, trying to solve the mystery while alternating as the cause of the mystery sounds absolutely fab to me.
Sniper Killer is coming to PC sometime in 2023.

A group of plucky modders have taken to expanding the 1990 Genesis/Mega Drive version of Ghostbusters to correct a longstanding problem with the game: Winston Zeddemore wasn‚Äôt in it. The Ghostbusters: Special Edition hack adds the fourth ‚Äòbuster. Beyond that, it also implements a slate of other improvements.
Developed in 1990 by Compile, Ghostbusters on Genesis/Mega Drive is a pretty unique title. It was released after Ghostbusters 2, but it is neither based on that title nor does it pull from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon series. Instead, it presents a different kind of sequel to the original game. It‚Äôs a side-scroller where you delve into various locations to purge them of ghosts.

Sony Pictures Entertainment, (yes, really), has released the first full trailer for its upcoming big-screen adaptation of one of the most successful driving simulators of all time, Gran Turismo. The new film, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9, CHAPPiE) will arrive in theaters this August.
The picture will tell a somewhat dramatized version of the very real story of die-hard Gran Turismo fan Jann Mardenborough, who won a series of Nissan-sponsored Gran Turismo tournaments, before eventually going on to become a bona-fide championship racing car driver. Mardenborough will be portrayed in the movie by Archie Madekwe (Midsommer) and will be joined by cast members Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings), Djimon Hounson (Guardians of the Galaxy), David Harbour (Stranger Things)‚Ä¶</span>

Publisher Fellow Traveller and Copychaser Games have announced that hot scooper Times &amp; Galaxy is the next game from the developers of Speed Dating for Ghosts. It‚Äôs slated for a PC release in 2024.
Times &amp; Galaxy casts you as the first-ever robot reporter. You‚Äôll pick your story, do some interviews, and scoop your scoop. You then have to assemble the story yourself (not actually write it out). In order to impress your readers and, more importantly, your editors, you‚Äôll be covering important topics such as cat shows and toy launches, and rubbing elbows with your co-workers between assignments.
https://youtu.be/KMjufslCX0o
This feels a little close to home to me. That‚Äôs maybe because multiple writers on the Copychaser Games team worked in journalism. I hesitate to call myself a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù because people like to hurt my feelings by putting that in quotation marks. Also because it implies a certain degree of professionalism that I don‚Äôt want to commit to. Otherwise, I‚Äôm afraid it will mean I might have to stop using the word ‚Äúbutthole‚Äù so often.
Time &amp; Galaxy looks fantastic, though. Beyond the colorful aesthetic, the awesome premise, and the excellent writing, the idea of having a machine try and write news has a lot of opportunity for satire. I mean, people are already talking about having AI take over the jobs of journalists. Is that what you really want? Robots know nothing about buttholes, and they definitely won‚Äôt overuse and misuse the word ‚Äúscoop.‚Äù You come to me for that kind of &quot;quality&quot; content.
Times &amp; Galaxy is currently only confirmed for PC, and it will be coming sometime in 2024. To whet your appetite for hot scoops, you can try out a demo for it today.

NetherRealm Studios has released a video thanking its fans for three decades of devotion to the Mortal Kombat series ‚Äî The video ends with a cryptic image that appears to be the first tease for a brand new title, presumably Mortal Kombat 12.
Backed by the awesome &quot;Subway&quot; theme from Mortal Kombat 3, the video sees various members of the NetherRealm team offer the community their thanks for sticking by the super-gory fight franchise since its inception way back in 1992. On deck are a plethora of studio names new and old, including graphics dude John Vogel, audio director Dan &quot;Toasty&quot; Forden, designer Derek Kirtzic, art director Steve Beran and, of course, co-creator and NetherRealm director Ed Boon.

I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of playing Street Fighter 6 multiple times since its initial reveal, just one short year ago. I first checked out the rad-looking sequel during the summer of 2022 at Birmingham&#x27;s VS Fighting tournament, then later that year at EGX London. I&#x27;ve also had the good fortune to take part in both beta tests and, as previously reported, I have been left in a pretty excitable state from each experience.
A fortnight ago, I was kindly invited to Capcom&#x27;s UK headquarters in order to check out what was, more or less, the full and final build of SF6. And, by the end of my short time spent with the complete game, my anticipation for this scrapper has, more or less, reached something of a eye-twitching, hand-scratching fever pitch... Or maybe that&#x27;‚Ä¶</span>

During a recent visit to Capcom&#x27;s European HQ, I was afforded the opportunity to check out the Arcade Mode adventure for Lily, one of the many exciting newcomers headed to incoming scrapper Street Fighter 6. I was able to take a look at the Thunderfoot princess&#x27; narrative, engage in a few battles, and even lock horns with a mighty Truck in the sequel&#x27;s returning Bonus Round.
Lily is a descendant of Mexico&#x27;s Thunderfoot Tribe, the same clan that previously brought us the Super Street Fighter II warrior T.Hawk. While much more diminutive in stature than ol&#x27; Timothy Hawk, Lily retains his strength and power through her indomitable spirit and proud nature. Armed with weighted clubs, Lily is also afforded very deceptive reach, and can also use the weapons to c‚Ä¶</span>

As those of an age may remember, when Crimson Viper first made her debut in 2009&#x27;s Street Fighter IV, there was a common opinion that in character design, personality, and playstyle, the Secret Agent Mom felt like SF&#x27;s answer to the fashion-forward King of Fighters roster. C. Viper fit like an (electric) glove, but something about her just felt different ‚Äî distinctly different from her SF brethren.
I recently visited Capcom HQ, where I had the chance to check out a full build of Street Fighter 6, complete with its launch roster. And while many of the new characters felt familiar ‚Äî retaining the skills of fighters who had maybe passed through the World Warrior ranks before ‚Äî one character really stood out, featuring a playstyle that felt borrowe‚Ä¶</span>

Redfall starts off in a curious place. Within the first moments of the game, the player is shown a montage of the little town‚Äôs downfall. Creatures of the night begin to fester and swarm, soon locking the town in with bloodsucking beasts, the cult that worships them, and the security contractors hired to cover it all up. A towering vampiress with a haloed visage holds you by the throat, telling you of big plans currently brewing, as the sun emerges outside.
The latest game from Arkane starts off strong. But as the days and nights go on in Redfall, I‚Äôm finding myself running up against its layout over and over. Some aspects are inventive twists on the four-player co-op shooter. But in both gameplay and technical aspects, it‚Äôs falling short of what I had hoped for.

We&#x27;ve gushed plenty of times over the stunning-looking Metroidvania Afterimage by developer Aurogon Shanghai. From its beautiful animation style to stunning watercolour backgrounds and hand-drawn characters and world, amidst the bustling genre of Metroidvania, it stands out in the best possible way.
The blend of colourful worlds and tight combat pay homage to some of the best in the genre, but it&#x27;s the art style that has long stuck out to us. Afterimage smashed its 2022 Kickstarter with fans falling head over heels in love with the game&#x27;s visual identity alone, and that magic has followed through to the final product. And it was one of the standout aspects in our review, where we said the game &quot;offers a lengthy, lovely-looking Metroidvania adventure.&quot;

Midnight Suns hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2, 2022, with plans for the PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions to launch at a later date. Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game&#x27;s fourth and final DLC ‚Äì Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero ‚Äì releases.¬†
As for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn&#x27;t provide anything more than, &quot;Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns is no longer planned.&quot; This follows news from earlier this year that the game&#x27;s director (and the director of Firaxis&#x27; modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio.¬†
PS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game&#x27;s Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm¬†adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.

                              <span>Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite experiences of 2022, and as it approaches its first anniversary on May 5, the team behind it reveals it&#x27;s begun work on its next project.
Gareth Damian Martin, the solo developer behind Jump Over the Age, is again joining forces with indie publisher Fellow Traveler, character artist Guillaume Singelin, and composer Amos Roddy on a new game. There‚Äôs no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the ‚Äúnear future.‚Äù¬†The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4.¬†
Citizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that &quot;Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I&#x27;ll be thinking about for years to come.&quot; Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022.¬†
Citizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.</span>

Electronic Arts acquired developer Metalhead Studio a year after the launch of Super Mega Baseball 3, meaning that the developer had the benefit of creating this fourth entry with the added resources of its new parent company.
The result appears evident. For the first time in series history, more than 200 legends of the sport (including cover star David Ortiz) are included in the roster alongside the fan-favorite cast of players from the earlier games in the series.

Unlike other many video game movies, Gran Turismo is actually based on real events. The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough&#x27;s ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it.¬†















	



  
    

  
      
            


      
  













Mardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou. Neil Blomkamp sits in the director‚Äôs chair.¬†
Gran Turismo premieres exclusively in theaters on August 11.</span>

Street Fighter 6 may feature thrilling 1v1 fights, but one of its most exciting features is its World Tour mode. This single-player sandbox story mode is a dramatic shift in what the series has offered, and players recently got to sample a small slice in a recent demo. On a trip to Capcom‚Äôs U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, I ventured beyond the demo for a more comprehensive look at what World Tour has to offer.¬†¬†
World Tour gives players robust tools to craft a custom fighter, then take them to the streets of Metro City and other locations on a journey to create the u‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.
Writing this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it‚Äôs weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town‚Äôs vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason.¬†
As a whole, Redfall‚Äôs gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I‚Äôd expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play.¬†
On a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few¬†locations, like a deranged scientist‚Äôs mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge¬†to incentivize¬†intelligent pathfinding.¬†Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed ‚Äì certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps.¬†
However, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I‚Äôve completed roughly 50 percent¬†of the game and its first story arc, but I‚Äôve only played for a few days and have more content to see.

We‚Äôre reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090,¬†AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM</span>

                              <span>More slack in the line
Team17 has revealed the roadmap to Black Salt Games‚Äô indie darling, Dredge, that continues through to the end of the year. While many additions could be considered ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù it will conclude with paid DLC at the end of the year.
First up, we‚Äôve got map markers. I didn‚Äôt even realize they weren‚Äôt already in the game. I guess I just didn‚Äôt need them so hard that I never looked to see if they were there.
Next up is a feature I always appreciate: a photo mode. It&#x27;s always nice being able to set up the perfect visual. You‚Äôll get this ability from a character in the game and can then use it to find new wildlife to snap photos of. As part of this update, you‚Äôll be able to turn off the aggressive behavior of certain sea monsters. While I feel like vulnerability is sort of central to the horror of Dredge, it will be helpful for anyone who just wants to explore without being harrowed.
In Q3, the Dredge team will be adding boat customization. Once again, I didn&#x27;t necessarily look for this while playing, but I always love new ways to get creative. This will come in the form of paint schemes and flags.
Life at sea
Finally, at the end of the year, Black Salt Games will release paid DLC for Dredge. The DLC will center around a mysterious corporation known as Ironhaven. While they claim to be simply investing in drilling operations to revitalize the area‚Äôs towns and settlements, their actual goals seem much more sinister. Nonetheless, you‚Äôll be aiding them with building up their facilities while uncovering their secrets.
While I wasn‚Äôt in love with Dredge, I appreciate it thematically. The paid DLC seems kind of cool, and I might be willing to check it out when it finally drops at the end of the year.
If you haven‚Äôt dropped anchor on Dredge, it‚Äôs available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.

I really thought this was going to be worse. Hearing about 2004&#x27;s Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in the years since Fallout 3 introduced console players to the franchise, I thought it was going to be an abomination. If Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (don‚Äôt get them confused) is the series‚Äô black sheep, then surely Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel was the sibling that died early because it was born without a butthole.
I was led to believe it was a barely related cash-in made by people who paid no care to the license it was based on. It has advertising for Bawls in it; that caffeinated energy drink with the cheeky name. Bawls. There was no way it could possibly be good.
It‚Äôs not, but it definitely has a butthole.

Honkai: Star Rail¬†has been out for just about a week now, and already, fans have started to create things around it. Art and memes have already been flooding social channels. And in a turn that surprised me a bit, the Trailblazer‚Äîthe main character chosen by the player‚Äîis getting quite a bit of attention.
In¬†Honkai: Star Rail, you assemble a party of adventurers and explorers to travel across the stars, dealing with the ever-present Stellaron threat. As you travel between worlds, you meet an ever-expanding cast of characters, though it remains centered on the Astral Express crew and your chosen Trailblazer. Though referred to by a chosen name or their pseudonym, fans often refer to the male version as Caelus and female as Stelle.

Almost two decades later, movie studios known for their cash settlement model are obtaining subpoenas regardless. Their latest target is Cox Communications, because that makes complete sense.

However, the court believes that the Redditors&#x27; First Amendment right to anonymous speech outweighs the interest of rightsholders.

                              <span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a pretty great game that, unfortunately, isn‚Äôt running as well as it could be for some players. The PC version has been especially problematic, and Respawn is addressing these issues with a performance update.¬†
The PC version of the game has reportedly been plagued with a variety of bugs and glitches, notably affecting frame rate. Today‚Äôs update, which is now live, is only stated as being¬†‚Äúperformance improvements for non-raytraced rendering&quot; in the patch notes.¬†
That doesn‚Äôt seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it&#x27;s worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:
Multiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.
Fixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.
Performance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Fixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis
Fixed various rendering issues.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.
Fixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.
Fixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.
Fixed various collision issues.
Fixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.
Fixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.
Fixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.
Fixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn‚Äôt save after leaving the chamber and die. 
Hopefully, today‚Äôs PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works. If you‚Äôre playing on PC, how has your experience with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor been? Has today‚Äôs update helped at all? Let us know in the comments.</span>

                              <span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past¬†$1 billion at the global box office.¬†
The film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490¬†million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination‚Äôs adaptation of Nintendo‚Äôs flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.¬†¬†
The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also just the fifth movie to cross the billion-dollar threshold since the pandemic started. It joins the coveted ranks of Avatar: The Way of Water, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick,¬†and Jurassic World Dominion.¬†

                              <span>Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation.¬†
Developer poncle has confirmed that it&#x27;s working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There‚Äôs currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast¬†or a premiere date.¬†
‚ÄúThe most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it&#x27;s a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It‚Äôs also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they&#x27;ve realised that there isn&#x27;t a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,‚Äù says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.
If you&#x27;re tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it&#x27;s worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its¬†two expansions ‚Äì Legacy¬†of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari ‚Äì¬†both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be¬†reference points for how this series may potentially appear.¬†
Vampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards¬†and walking¬†away with a couple of BAFTA trophies¬†this year, including winning Best Game. You can read our review of Vampire Survivors here.</span>

                              <span>When tackling direct infringers becomes impractical, rightsholders can take legal action against entities that are indirectly involved. Intermediaries and service providers are obvious targets but tend to enjoy protection under so-called &#x27;safe harbor&#x27; provisions. In Australia, digital platforms want these protections too, claiming they will boost anti-piracy cooperation. Rightsholders believe that cooperation is directly linked to a credible threat of liability.

                              <span>With 30 million-odd pre-registrations under its belt prior to coming out, Honkai: Star Rail was always going to be a pretty big deal when it eventually launched. The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it&#x27;s already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That&#x27;s a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai&#x27;s turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well?

                              <span>Hargh blargh games are bad, roguelikes are worse, whinge moan complain. It is that time once again. You know whether my complaints will bother you, so consider this a massive recommendation if they dont: Shardtide Verminp... Punktide Verminsha... Shardpunk... goddamn it. Hang on.
Shardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn&#x27;t feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn&#x27;t also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and &quot;repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum&quot; though, I can&#x27;t pretend I don&#x27;t enjoy it anyway.

                              <span>Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam&#x27;s desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They&#x27;re overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that&#x27;s happened in the game&#x27;s community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you&#x27;re following a guide, say, and don&#x27;t want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m quite upset about, and that&#x27;s the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad.

                              <span>I quite enjoy the vwing-vwing lighstabering at the heart of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is why it now pains me to have an extended moan about the PC version&#x27;s technical troubles. 


Despite the odd glimmer of joy, like better-than-expected performance on its lowest system requirements, much about playing Jedi: Survivor on Windows suggests it could have used a little more time in the bacta tank. Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.

                              <span>Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game&#x27;s performance in Unreal Engine 5.¬†
Layers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games&#x27; DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called &quot;The Final Note&quot; that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game&#x27;s story.¬†Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game&#x27;s performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below:¬†


Layers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word &quot;Lumen&quot; from Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects &quot;to create particle effects in real time&quot; and Action System Controls &quot;to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,&quot; according to a press release.¬†
&quot;Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,&quot; Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. &quot;It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that ‚Äì thanks to the engine ‚Äì we&#x27;ll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.&quot;¬†
Layers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June.¬†

                              <span>From Software, the developer behind last year&#x27;s critically acclaimed Elden Ring, announced Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon at The Game Awards 2022. Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it&#x27;s probably sooner than you expected.¬†
That&#x27;s because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world.¬†
Check out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below:¬†


As you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this¬†still looks decidedly From Software. And we can&#x27;t wait to check it out in just a few months.¬†
The trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game&#x27;s various digital editions and the special Collector&#x27;s Edition ‚Äì check them both out below:¬†

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023. While waiting to learn more, check out the reveal trailer from last December. Read about From Software&#x27;s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring after that.¬†

                              <span>Redfall, the vampire FPS from Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, is out in less than a week and to prepare players for what awaits, the team has released a new launch trailer aptly set to a cover of¬†Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun.&quot;¬†
It&#x27;s a nice cover, and it goes quite well with what&#x27;s happening in Redfall, Massachusetts, as a total eclipse has made it a haven for the game&#x27;s enemy vampires. The launch trailer itself is more of what you&#x27;d expect from a Redfall trailer ‚Äì vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below:¬†


For more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda. Listen to our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with Redfall¬†after that.¬†
Redfall launches on Xbox Series X/S and PC next Tuesday on May 2.¬†

                              <span>I spent time last week watching old, Japanese PlayStation game adverts after puzzler Humanity referenced them in its own trailer. Among those adverts were several for Fantavision, a little-loved colour-matching puzzle game about firework displays from 2000.

Imagine my surprise when today Fantavision showed up on Steam.

                              <span>Live A Live was originally released in 1994, but only on SNES and only in Japan. It was short as far as Square Enix JRPGs from the period go, but was unique in that it featured 8 inter-connected stories set across 8 time periods. 

Last year, a remake brought the game to Nintendo Switch, and as of today it&#x27;s also available on Steam.

Might &amp; Magic: Clash Of Heroes was a surprise delight on Nintendo DS in 2009 and an HD release made its way to PC in 2011.

Now it&#x27;s getting a Definitive Edition release courtesy of Dotemu, with updated character art, quality-of-life improvements and rebalanced multiplayer.

                              <span>The Case Of The Golden Idol was one of my favourite games of 2022, but one twist I didn&#x27;t see coming from the heir to Obra Dinn&#x27;s detective crown was more of it, or more of it so soon, for that matter. Happily, developers Color Gray Games have announced a new DLC pack is coming for The Golden Idol next week called The Spider Of Lanka. Set in 1741, a year before the first scenario of The Golden Idol proper, this trio of new cases looks set to shed extra light on the titular idol whose mysterious powers set the original game in motion. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t tell you much more than that, as most of the announcement details have been slapped with big black REDACTED marks. Have a watch of the reveal trailer below instead.

                              <span>For me, developers Deconstructeam are the GOAT at fleshing out characters through the subtle art of conversation. Whether it‚Äôs revealing the dark secrets of corporate espionage from the mouths of loose-lipped employees after a cocktail or two in The Red Strings Club, uncovering the cut-throat life of a hitman as he arranges beautiful bouquets in Eternal Home Floristry, or unravelling the personal philosophies of an old man who claims he can speak to God through a radio in Interview With A Whisperer, their games are detailed portraits of complex people. And after playing through an hour-long preview build of the team‚Äôs next game, the fresly unveiled The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, I can already tell that this adventure is one of their most complex portraits yet. This time, folks, we&#x27;re dealing with divination, cosmic gods and sweet, sweet revenge.

                              <span>When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game&#x27;s combat and dropping the cards entirely. 
&quot;Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!&quot; laughs creative director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It&#x27;s well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon&#x27;s credit he does also concede that he was perhaps &quot;a little na√Øve&quot; at the time for thinking it would go down without question.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t feel very strongly about Age Of Wonders 4. But I‚Äôll be fair; it&#x27;s definitely good.
I&#x27;ve enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn&#x27;t were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven&#x27;t captured my imagination.
It is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the &quot;cursed toadlings&quot; I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you&#x27;ll have access to upfront.

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.


A new Dota patch came out last week, and it‚Äôs a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that‚Äôs 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It‚Äôs certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship.

                              <span>When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it&#x27;s his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. &quot;It&#x27;s surreal,&quot; he says. &quot;For probably the next ten years, I&#x27;ll refer to it as &#x27;we&#x27; when we talk about Firaxis, and it&#x27;s sad to think it&#x27;s not the right pronoun anymore. It&#x27;s exciting, but a little terrifying.&quot;
On the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel&#x27;s Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he&#x27;s so well known for. 
Solomon&#x27;s next adventure, though, won&#x27;t have the certainty of Midnight Suns&#x27; supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon&#x27;s third day of unemployment when we speak; it&#x27;s also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently.

                              <span>Long-running sci-fi MMO Warframe has just released its biggest update yet, The Duviri Paradox, for free. Jumping into any 10-year-old game can be intimidating, especially an MMO, but developer Digital Extremes say this is the first story-driven update that‚Äôs not progression-locked based on skill level or experience with the game. In other words, this is a new experience within Warframe that‚Äôs immediately available to newcomers, while also adding weird cool stuff for old-timers.

                              <span>Forgive me, I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s recently got a Steam Deck and I&#x27;m going through the honeymoon phase. Except it&#x27;s a phase which is unlikely to end? Anyway, it&#x27;s proven to be an excellent way to rinse Vampire Survivors, a game I wouldn&#x27;t - I have nothing against those who do -  play upright on a monitor. Survival is best served on the couch, curled up like a shrimp with the blood draining from my arms as I hold the TV slab at some atrocious angle.
Anyway, I&#x27;ve come to realise that Vampire Survivors might be a game about running away, but actually peaks when you come to a standstill. There&#x27;s a special kind of joy to be had when you&#x27;re able to stop and idle.

                              <span>After a few weeks in time limbo, Quantum Break has returned to storefronts on PC and Xbox. Publisher Microsoft had said ‚Äúsome licences that expired‚Äù were to blame for its removal from Game Pass (for consoles), which was probably the same reason it was pulled from storefronts too. It‚Äôs now rewound the clocks, available to buy, and as a nice bonus, it‚Äôs joined PC Game Pass for the first time since it was previously only available on the console version of the service.

                              <span>Some of the world&#x27;s largest pirate sites, offering movies, TV shows and anime for free, are reportedly operated from Vietnam. The statistics are nothing short of extraordinary and measured in billions of visits per year. Fmovies, Bmovies, Bflix and 9anime are just a few of the sites causing problems for rightsholders. Despite U.S. concerns, Vietnam seems unwilling to pull the plug.

                              <span>With more web traffic than Netflix and Disney, pirate streaming site Pobre.tv was hugely popular in Portugal. A few days ago the site mysteriously went offline without any word from its operators. No anti-piracy agency has taken credit either, but ACE says that it obtained several disclosure orders related to the site in recent weeks.

                              <span>Confession time, everyone: I&#x27;m still only about 2.5 hours into Disco Elysium. Games journalism sin or what? Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I&#x27;d restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn&#x27;t extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree, but what&#x27;s it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?
Well, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game&#x27;s presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character&#x27;s strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.

                              <span>Last time, you decided that unit veterancy is better than rerolling dice. I&#x27;m not surprised, given that rerolling dice is a pretty niche thing only seen in a handful of games, but oh what a glorious niche thing! Fine, fine. We continue. This week, I ask you to choose between the mechanism for controlling magic and the mechanism for controlling a big daft rock. What&#x27;s better: cool spellcasting gestures, or seizing control of a rolling boulder trap?

                              <span>Here&#x27;s an idea! You know that 2.5-inch laptop drive that you have sitting around ever since you upgraded a year or two back? How about repurposing it as a portable SSD or HDD with this USB-C enclosure? For ¬£6, you can give that drive a new lease on life. Your new drive will be useful too, ideal for backups, moving video files to your TV or just moving game directories between PCs. 
n.b. Face in image above is unrelated, I just wanted to fill out the space without drawing attention to the USB cables that stop at the edge. Thanks to my pal Ross for the illustration.

                              <span>In my preview of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor I said it was a competent game that essentially offered Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but more. Playing the full thing reveals I was correct, both for better and for worse, which is why you should never doubt me. Are we done here?
Oh alright. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a third-person action game where you play Cal Kestis in his second rip-roaring adventure across a localised part of the galaxy, fighting both the Empire and a very naughty little Sith, with a flanking attack from Cal&#x27;s own regrets about getting people killed all the time. Crucially though, at least for the purposes of having fun, Cal has one of those hot glowsticks that goes *whummmmm* and cute robot friend BD-1 - but you will often be deploying both in the effort to get a new pair of trousers.

                              <span>My name is Katharine and I&#x27;m a reformed Pok√©addict. I thought I&#x27;d get that out there right at the start, because you can&#x27;t really talk about Cassette Beasts without talking a bit about Pok√©mon. Admittedly, the idea of an open world Pok√©mon-like might have lost some of its shine now that the actual Pok√©mon games have finally gone and done it themselves with last year&#x27;s Scarlet and Violet releases, but Cassette Beasts, the debut game from UK micro team Bytten Studio, is banging a different kind of drum to Nintendo&#x27;s primo monster catcher.

                              <span>Microsoft‚Äôs proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard King has hit a large snag on the road. The UK‚Äôs Competitions And Markets Authority (CMA) previously released their provisional findings on the $69 billion buyout, laying out concerns over less competition and innovation for UK gamers. Microsoft were allowed to respond to the CMA‚Äôs findings, but it seems they weren‚Äôt able to quell the regulator‚Äôs concerns, as the CMA have now vetoed the merger.

Ed enjoyed his two minutes of hands-on time last year, and with a pedigree this good, it‚Äôs probably worth checking out for fans of sleepy sports.

                              <span>A big new update to unofficial mod tools for Alien: Isolation has greatly expanded the range of mods people can make. Modders can now add custom models, materials, textures, and more to Creative Assembly&#x27;s horror shooter. To quickly demonstrate the new capabilities, the toolmaker has whipped up a small example: importing classic Counter-Strike map de_dust2 into Isolation. You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2&#x27;s sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.

This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel‚Äôs Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.
It‚Äôs an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It‚Äôs pretty clear that Kafka isn‚Äôt a hero, but they‚Äôve woken you up, and since you‚Äôve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores serves fans a substantial dessert that brings the main course of the campaign to a satisfying close. A dangerous new sandbox and a compelling story await Aloy, offering a nice wrap-up that also provides some tantalizing glimpses into the future.¬†
Unlike Zero Dawn‚Äôs Frozen Wilds DLC, which was a good but skippable side story, Burning Shores has enough relevant plot advancement to make it closer to required playing. Taking place immediately after the sequel‚Äôs conclusion, this abbreviated tale sees Aloy travel to the volcanically fra‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>Join hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard as the two take a quick look at Bramble: The Mountain King, a spooky and horrific adventure game inspired by Nordic Folklore that plays like Little Nightmares. It comes from Dimfrost Studios and features gorgeous (if not terrifying) visuals and a fun loop of traversal and puzzle solving. And fortunately, you don&#x27;t have to wait long because it hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC tomorrow on April 27.¬†
If you&#x27;re wondering whether it&#x27;s a game you should pick up, check out roughly 13 minutes of new Bramble: The Mountain King footage in the latest New Gameplay Today:¬†

                              <span>Humanity is a new puzzle game from the same publisher as Tetris Effect. In the game you, as a dog, must direct an endless stream of humans as they mindlessly walk forward. It&#x27;s up to you to make sure they reach safety. Join Charles Harte and me as we play a few puzzles (without revealing the final solutions) and make sure Humanity can live on. At least, I think that&#x27;s what the game is about.
As a bonus, the game is also fully playable in VR using PlayStation VR2, so we took the time to show off that version of the game, as well. It is functionally the same, but it&#x27;s nice to have an alternate, encompassing way to play.

If the only thought in your mind upon completing 2019‚Äôs Jedi: Fallen Order was that you wanted more, then I have excellent news. Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn‚Äôt just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It‚Äôs a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters.

                              <span>Flashback 2 got a fresh gameplay trailer today showing off¬†the sequel‚Äôs modernized graphical facelift as well as a November release window.
The sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven‚Äôt seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year.¬†Today‚Äôs video provides a look at how hero Conrad B. Hart (and his A.I.-powered weapon¬†A.I.S.H.A.) faces off against the shapeshifting aliens known as the Morph once more. Though the action¬†largely retains its 2D roots, the game¬†now sports 3D levels for more depth of movement, especially during firefights. Flashback 2 is helmed by original creator Paul Cuisset alongside the development team at¬†Microids Studio Lyon.¬†


Flashback 2 launches in November for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch and PC.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly¬†January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth.¬†
More specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox&#x27;s gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox&#x27;s gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count ‚Äì the latest count was 25 million in January 2022.¬†
As for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply.¬†
Here are some other numbers from Microsoft&#x27;s financial results:¬†
Revenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)
Operating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)
Net income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)
Xbox hardware revenue is down 30%
Xbox content and services revenue is up 3%
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%
These results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard¬†today. You can read more about that here.¬†

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has the unenviable task of following what many consider to be one of the greatest games in recent memory. When it launched in 2017, Breath of the Wild revolutionized the longstanding franchise formula in innumerable ways, giving players the biggest world the series has ever featured and mechanics that allowed them to experiment with the game&#x27;s physics. After spending more than an hour playing some early moments of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the answer to how this game plans on following such a tough act is a bit clearer.

The Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same function as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., has blocked Microsoft&#x27;s pending $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns.¬†
This news is somewhat shocking, as quite a few experts predicted the CMA would allow the deal to go through, and while this block presents a large barrier to Microsoft&#x27;s progress forward toward this acquisition, it&#x27;s not a be-all, end-all for the purchase. Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA&#x27;s ruling.¬†

                              <span>Paul Ehreth, a former Halo and Control developer, has opened Anchor Point Studios, a new studio within NetEase Games.¬†
The team is aiming to create &quot;immersive and engaging action-adventure games that offer social and multiplayer experiences,&quot; according to a press release. Ehreth, who has more than 20 years of experience as a game director and designer on console and PC games, is joined by a team of industry veterans with experience from Ghost of Tsushima, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Division, and more.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so excited to officially drop our anchor in Barcelona, the hometown of my great-grandparents, and start building a strong team for our journey of exploration together with NetEase Games,&quot; Ehreth writes in the press release.¬†&quot;Our studio‚Äôs motto is ‚ÄòPer Aspera, Ad Astra‚Äô (‚Äòthrough hardships, to the stars‚Äô) because we want to build an adventure that will stay fresh and provide a unique experience that will surprise and delight people each time they play, and I want us to acknowledge the challenges we are setting out to face. We&#x27;re grateful to NetEase Games for giving us the creative freedom and resources to build this interconnected world that will expand beyond games and reach into other mediums as well.‚Äù¬†

Anchor Point Studios plans to develop action-adventure games for console and PC that &quot;push the boundaries of entertainment and bring elements of surprise into the gameplay.&quot;

The studio¬†is based in Barcelona, Spain, but the team will be hiring up to 100 employees across Europe and North America, &quot;seeking developers, technical artists, and designers to work in its offices, remotely, or in a hybrid capacity.&quot;¬†
There&#x27;s no word on when we can expect to see or hear about the studio&#x27;s first game.</span>

                              <span>For all of Fallout 76‚Äôs faults, the multiplayer shooter has fostered one of the most interesting communities in any game, leading to fun mutations such as the theatre company experimenting with performance art in-game. The Wasteland Theatre Company previously tackled Shakespeare and A Christmas Carol, and they&#x27;ve now reconvened with a post-apocalyptic performance of Alice In Wonderland, appropriately adapted as Alice In The Wasteland.

                              <span>Kingston&#x27;s Fury Renegade SSD was the fastest one we&#x27;d tested in early 2022, although it was later surpassed by the marginally faster WD SN850x and Samsung 990 Pro. Regardless, it&#x27;s an extremely capable PCIe 4.0 SSD - and now it&#x27;s available for $134.99 for a 2TB model after a discount at B&amp;H Photo Video in the US. To get this price, which represents an oustanding $45 discount, you just need to add the drive to your cart - easy enough, right?

Larger space regimes require more work, so this expansion is for fans of big government, focusing on Stellaris&#x27; collection of leaders, expanding the council system, and introducing deeper character progression. It‚Äôs also adding a new Origin delving into the leader who founded your galactic empire, which you can see teased in the very short, very non-descript trailer below.

After playing the Steam demo, I can tell you that it&#x27;s one of the most charming games I&#x27;ve played all year, and it looks like I&#x27;ll be able to play the rest soon because Mail Time is out this week on Thursday April 27th.

                              <span>Owners of AMD Ryzen 7000 processors, you may wish to reconsider any overclocking plans. This hardware family may include some good gaming CPUs but several users have recently reported cases of fatal overheating, sometimes even with their processors burning the motherboard socket in the process.


Investigations by Tom‚Äôs Hardware and YouTuber der8auer suggest the culprit is SoC (system on chip) voltages being pushed beyond safe levels during memory overclocking attempts. AMD haven‚Äôt confirmed this directly, but are supposedly working on a fix that would prevent this accidental overvolting from happening again.

AEGIS have also teamed up with the CWA, the labour union that assisted other studio‚Äôs unionisation efforts and who previously filed unfair labour charges against Activision Blizzard.

                              <span>A draft law that aims to criminalize and prosecute those who &quot;create conditions for online piracy&quot; has been approved by Bulgaria&#x27;s Council of Ministers. The proposed amendments are Bulgaria&#x27;s response to heavy criticism from the United States, most publicly via the USTR&#x27;s Special 301 Reports. It&#x27;s hoped that prison sentences of up to six years will send a deterrent message.

                              <span>Funko Fusion, the mash-up co-op action game featuring a bizarre assortment of disparate properties, is the first game from 10:10 Studios. The studio was founded by TT Games veterans like Arthur Parsons, who worked as lead designer on about a dozen of TT Games&#x27; Lego games.
The game features Funko characters and worlds from Jurassic World, Back to the Future, The Umbrella Academy, The Thing, Child‚Äôs Play 2, Masters of the Universe, and other NBCUniversal properties.


Many of the properties featured¬†in the trailer above are R-rated, and characters lose limbs and heads, use flame throwers, and get eaten by monsters. It never veers into full, non-cartoon violence, but compared to the Lego games the team worked on in the past, Funko Fusion seems like it is going for a more mature audience.

Funko Fusion is coming to consoles and PC next year.</span>

                              <span>Netflix has released the first official teaser for its upcoming season of The Witcher alongside the release dates for Volume 1 and Volume¬†2.¬†
The Witcher: Season 3 still features Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia but it will be his last season in the role as Netflix announced last year that Liam Hemsworth would be replacing him as the titular Witcher in Season 4. If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill&#x27;s final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.¬†
Check it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix&#x27;s The Witcher:¬†


As you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what&#x27;s in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27.¬†

Introducing something new to me in action combat is rare. In games that feature it, you‚Äôre likely using either guns to kill enemies or melee action to take them down, and I‚Äôm not often surprised by how this can work. I can, of course, fall in love with familiar combat despite that, but it‚Äôs always exciting to experience something I haven‚Äôt before, which is what Strayed Lights manages to do.¬†

                              <span>The EVGA Z20 optical mechanical keyboard is a super-solid option with a boatload of features - and it&#x27;s currently 69% off at Amazon UK, bringing it down to a measly ¬£39.98. This is an awesome price for a keyboard of this size and quality, and well worth picking up even if you&#x27;ve already got a mechanical keyboard - or if you&#x27;ve never tried one before.

                              <span>The Steam Deck is a handy device, but its 45W charger isn&#x27;t the most convenient to lug around as it only charges one thing at a time and takes up a fair amount of space. That&#x27;s why I tend to opt for a multi-port charger, so I set out to find one recently that would charge my Steam Deck, MacBook, Pixel smartphone and Pixel watch all from a single point. 
I eventually ended up with this 65W GaN charger from UGreen, which includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A for ¬£39.99 - but today this model has been reduced by 15%, bringing it down to ¬£33.99 where it&#x27;s well worth recommending.

This week, genuinely by chance, my eye was caught mostly by first-person shooters. Come for those, stay for the impressive puppet tech, the giant snake, the cute dog, and the colossal crocodile.

Really, though, one of the best experiences you can have this Steam Puzzle Fest week is by downloading the free demo for upcoming puzzler Viewfinder. Developed by Sad Owl Studios, I had a sneaky peek at this at GDC last month and was properly blown away by it. It might look like just another Witness-like, but don&#x27;t be fooled. There are some real smart ideas in here, and I dare you not to go &#x27;OooOOOooooOOOooooh&#x27; when you see the in-game photos you take come to life in all their full, 3D explorable glory.

                              <span>I do love me a good farming sim, and I also love a good detective game, so imagine my brain exploding when I saw Grave Seasons for the first time, a farming murder mystery hybrid in the works by developer Son M and their studio Perfect Garbage. It&#x27;s still very early in development (like there isn&#x27;t even a Steam page for it yet), but it&#x27;s still an incredible-sounding concept, as every time you start a new game, a random NPC will be selected to become a serial killer. You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!

                              <span>For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it&#x27;s simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. 
Whether you&#x27;re successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you&#x27;re trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren&#x27;t nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of &#x27;Success. Barely&#x27; in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.

                              <span>As our shuttle hits the ground, the world erupts into smoke, chaos, and confusion. Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (‚ÄúOh, I guess that‚Äôs what ‚Äòknock out‚Äô means,‚Äù I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don‚Äôt have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It‚Äôs a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.
For fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it&#x27;s one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it‚Äôs exiting early access for a full release, it‚Äôs safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I‚Äôve seen yet.

                              <span>Knowing that wombats&#x27; dump is little stackable cubes was one of the fun facts I learned at school (it was either a rhetorical proof for or against the existence of God; I forget which). This knowledge comes in handy for understanding the game Hardhat Wombat, coming from George Fan (of Plants Vs. Zombies fame), with Andy Hull (of programmer on Spelunky fame). Out later this year, it&#x27;s a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.

In addition to pursuing hosting services, Discord, and GitHub repositories, Mojang is also asking Google to disappear Eaglercraft from search results. While the original developer appears to have thrown in the towel, for now at least, others show no sign of stopping.

                              <span>Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon¬†Forbidden West&#x27;s Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy.¬†
This news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It&#x27;s a move similar to the one¬†the team&#x27;s former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that¬†director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios.¬†


Within that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy&#x27;s world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle.¬†
&quot;We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy&#x27;s next adventure and our exciting online project,&quot; the statement reads.¬†
As you can see, Guerrilla isn&#x27;t trying to hide it ‚Äì the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the &quot;exciting online project&quot; being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy&#x27;s next adventure and that online project.¬†
In terms of the studio&#x27;s new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will &quot;be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.&quot;¬†
This statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after &quot;an incredible 20 years&quot; there:¬†

                              <span>Sons Of The Forest just received its fourth major patch and it adds some new features to the cannibal survival sim. The more exciting changes might lie in the &quot;improvements&quot;, however, which include things like your sidekick Kelvin being able to carry two logs at the same time and brighter night vision goggles.

                              <span>Super Replay returns, and we&#x27;re checking out Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts! Join us today¬†Friday on Twitch at 2¬†p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We&#x27;ll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel.¬†
Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11,¬†2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry¬†in Rare&#x27;s beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where¬†players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble¬†their own wacky¬†contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to¬†how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will¬†I land on it? Let&#x27;s find out.
Join me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360&#x27;s biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey.¬†

You&#x27;ll need to log in to your GI account and click &quot;okay to print&quot; for your letter or question to go through. We&#x27;d also love it if you included your location (city, state, or country will do). We&#x27;ll look through the questions and pick a few to include in our next issue, which releases on May 16.
For each issue, we ask our community a question for our SoundOff section. This time around, we want to know...
&quot;What was the most excited you have ever been for a game to come out?&quot;
You can answer this question and/or include any other feedback/questions you want. Thank you again for your support throughout the years, and we hope many of you get the chance to have your letter printed in an upcoming issue!

The company announced this on a new PlayStation Blog, noting that it&#x27;s been in a publishing partnership with Firewalk Studios and ProbablyMonsters since 2021 and that it&#x27;s now happy to expand that relationship by bringing the studio under the PlayStation umbrella. The studio has been working on its &quot;first original AAA multiplayer game&quot; for PlayStation and it sounds like development on that will continue.¬†
&quot;Since announcing our publishing partnership with ProbablyMonsters and Firewalk in 2021, we continue to be impressed by the team&#x27;s ambitions to build a modern multiplayer game that connects players in new and innovative ways,&quot; Head of PlayStation Hermen Hulst writes in the blog. &quot;The studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds grounde‚Ä¶</span>

                              <span>One of the most exciting and mysterious elements of Street Fighter 6 has been a World Tour, a single-player open-world exploration mode Capcom had previously¬†only shown glimpses of. Thankfully, today‚Äôs Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.
World Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode‚Äôs protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you‚Äôre dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour‚Äôs many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall.¬†

                              <span>Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.
&quot;A big part of Street Fighter&#x27;s charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,&quot; executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today&#x27;s Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. &quot;We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players ‚Äì and for us as well ‚Äì the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we&#x27;re continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.&quot;
During Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024.¬†These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.
If you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version.¬†Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2. For more on the game, check out our exclusive coverage hub here.</span>

                              <span>Diablo IV may have¬†gone gold, but Blizzard wants¬†to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it&#x27;s¬†opening the gates of¬†Sanctuary¬†to players one more time in a third¬†open beta next month.¬†
This next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they&#x27;re as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.
Server Slam weekend will be a¬†clean slate as progression¬†from the previous betas does¬†not carry over.¬†Additionally, the beta¬†supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:
The Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)
The Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)
The Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)
A new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).
Diablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It‚Äôs also Game Informer‚Äôs cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.</span>

                              <span>After teasing the game during the 2022 Game Awards and giving the game a proper trailer last week, Ascendent Studios is back with a new showcase for the title, this time focused on gameplay. The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.


Along with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game&#x27;s environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.


For a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here. You can also expect even more from our trip in an upcoming issue of Game Informer magazine.</span>

                              <span>HeR Interactive‚Äôs The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill are now ready for testing in ScummVM!
The Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.
Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.
You will need the data files from the games‚Äô original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill‚Äôs Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.

                              <span>OpenTTD 13.0 has been out for two months and we‚Äôve found some bugs to fix. Most notably, we‚Äôve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town‚Äôs local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we‚Äôve added a callback to select how the engine‚Äôs name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker</span>

                              <span>We are proud to announce that network-enabled Humongous Entertainment titles are now playable online! Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!
This all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim ‚Äújibbodahibbo‚Äù Westerkamp and Sam ‚ÄúQuestionMonkey‚Äù Kupfer.
Please note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that&#x27;s your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.
If you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.
This fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.
* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.
