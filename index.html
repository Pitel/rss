You might remember a 3D platformer named Lunistice that was meant to be released on the Nintendo Switch in September. In the end, it got delayed and has now been locked in for next month.
Yes, this 3D platformer inspired by the PSX and Sega Saturn era will be released on 10th November for both the Switch and PC. The delay has apparently given the developer &#x27;A Grumpy Fox&#x27; time to add two guest characters from the Toree series and Holomento.

Activision&#x27;s latest Call of Duty game arrives this week, and while there&#x27;s no Nintendo release, there has been some conversation from the Xbox boss Phil Spencer about bringing the popular first-person shooter series to the Switch.
Speaking to the Wall Street Journal recently, Spencer mentioned how Microsoft&#x27;s plan for the series when the Activision Blizzard deal goes through could be to treat it like Minecraft and make it available on as &quot;many different screens&quot; as possible - including Switch (via The Verge senior editor, Tom Warren).

Halloween is my favorite holiday, and October is my favorite month of the year. Last year I dedicated four weeks of my column to be about storytelling in games that also related to Halloween, but it turns out that&#x27;s a pretty niche topic to keep coming up with ideas for over and over. This year I&#x27;ve instead resigned myself to watching and playing as many Halloween related movies and games as I can, and I have to say that plan has done a tremendous job of getting me in the spirit of the season.
There are a few games I come back to every year, chief among them being Until Dawn. It&#x27;s a great game to play with friends, and it&#x27;s scary enough to spook me, but not so scary that I have to sleep with the lights on.

Some version of a real life, widespread virtual reality world has been an aspiration of sci-fi enthusiasts for decades, and as technology has improved in recent years, that dream has become closer than ever before. Meta (formerly Facebook) and Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s Metaverse project have been the closest mainstream attempt we&#x27;ve seen, but if that&#x27;s the best we have, it&#x27;ll be a while until we see a VR world akin to something out of Ready Player One. The internet has taken the opportunity to roast pretty much everything the Metaverse has shown because, well, it looks ridiculous. Take their most recent announcement about adding legs, for example, which apparently don&#x27;t even work how they said they do.

                              <span>A few helpful tidbits to get your head around Marvel Snap
Marvel Snap recently went into early access on mobile platforms and PC, and it&#x27;s been creeping its way into every social feed. I&#x27;ve seen players who rarely get hooked on a card game seeking out some Marvel Snap tips, deck advice, or just sharing bizarre board states.
I, too, have been deep in the Snap mines. This isn&#x27;t my first rodeo, as I&#x27;ve spent a decent chunk of time in games like Hearthstone and Artifact, and dabbled in card games like Magic: The Gathering. Heck, Geralt of Rivia and I dominated Novigrad in Gwent.
With that in mind, I thought I&#x27;d provide some helpful tips for players new to the game, or maybe even new to the ideas in Second Dinner&#x27;s card game.

                              <span>38-inch gaming ultrawides are few and far between, and it&#x27;s particularly rare to find good deals on them - so that&#x27;s why I was excited to see this Dell Alienware AW3821DW on sale with a code from HUKD. When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. 
Let&#x27;s quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating. All in all, it&#x27;s a ton of monitor for a fairly reasonable price.

                              <span>The Ryzen 7 5800X3D is one of AMD&#x27;s fastest gaming CPUs - and the only one of the top contenders that runs on cheap and widely available AM4 motherboards with DDR4 RAM. Earlier this week we covered a deal for the 5800X3D in the US, and now we&#x27;re back to finish the job with a deal for the UK market. 
Right now Ebuyer are taking orders for the 5800X3D at £349, a solid £110 discount from its UK RRP. A lot of folks have already jumped on this deal, using up Ebuyer&#x27;s existing stock, but you can order now for delivery on October 31st - and get a spooky Halloween upgrade for your PC.

                              <span>Ahead of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s full release on October 28th, I’ve been using its campaign early access to get familiar with its inner PC workings. As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. 
After Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.

                              <span>I’m fairly sure that zombies are the perfect video game enemies. They’re relentless, for one thing, happily chomping their way through anyone who gets in their path. The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I&#x27;ve put together a list of my favourite zombie games.

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t have the greatest understanding of how one is meant to play a real-time strategy game as a child. It wasn&#x27;t a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I&#x27;d had enough fun.
This was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I&#x27;d amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I&#x27;d tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.

The team describe Nightmare as a “mind-shattering extradimensional take on the classic CoD zombies formula” with some emotional baggage on the side. Essentially, it’s a horror FPS that has you up against vampires, werewolves, and angels (the bad kind) across six biomes. This bite-sized FPS acts as a companion piece to next year’s El Paso, Elsewhere, the previously announced third-person shooter

The “full-fledged” remake of 2007’s RPG is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and will use the same toolsets that CDPR is creating for their upcoming Witcher trilogy. The studio call the project a “modern reimagining” and say they’re “updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it.”

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of talking about The Callisto Protocol this year, starting with the game&#x27;s gore system and spiky walls at Summer Geoff Fest, before finding out its Die Hard and Shaun Of The Dead inspirations at Gamescom. In-between all the talking? Lots of slides and presentations and absolutely no hands anywhere near controllers. But finally, finally, I&#x27;ve played a 90-minute PS5 demo of The Callisto Protocol and can confirm that it felt like a last-gen game in a good way: all photorealistic sweat and blood scrawled on walls, coupled with 360-era exploration and fighting. Refreshingly familiar, I&#x27;d say.

Amazon posted a screengrab from the show on Twitter last night, depicting three Vault 33 dwellers staring at a silhouette coming in or out of the Vault - and what appears to be a body lying on the ground beside them. This is the first and only proper look we&#x27;ve had at the adaptation since August’s leaked set images mysteriously disappeared from the internet, but that hasn’t stopped fans from wildly theorising about what&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>After the past three years, I’d have happily never heard the word &quot;plague&quot; again, let alone in the context of one of my favourite co-op games. Yet after an early play around with Deep Rock Galactic Season 3, I’m already sold that this update – which centers around a corrupting, planet-wide infection – could be its best one yet.
After repelling a robot-spamming rival corp across Seasons 1 and 2, your reward in Season 3 – which launches on November 3rd – is to find your mining operating pelted by a meteorite storm. And they’re carrying a nasty payload: Rockpox, a contagion that quickly infects both the caves of Hoxxes IV and the many, many giant bugs living within them. These sickly Glyphids and contaminated caverns will present you and your fellow space dwarves with some new perils, but also new opportunities to turn a management-pleasing profit. And isn’t providing value to shareholders why we’re all here to begin with?

                              <span>Last time, you decided that relocatable buildings are better than slide kicks. I often side with functionality over flash but honestly, this is gutting. Still, this is science, and I respect the process. Next up, I am asking you to choose between two things which, if we&#x27;re honest with ourselves, are both really about trying to be cool.

                              <span>Nothing frightens me more than not being in control. The fear of an outside force pushing me into the corners of my mind and redecorating however they wish. It’s what should be scary about zombies when they’re not just mindless headshot fodder. This is also the main fear behind Endoparasitic, a top-down horror game released earlier this week.

                              <span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&#x27;s campaign may be the best it&#x27;s been for a long while. There&#x27;s great variety in the game&#x27;s first-person shooty bang with plenty of interesting ideas to break the illusion of it being an on-the-rails ride. Where it excels is in its action movie sequences, but it also takes itself too seriously at times and struggles to balance the sensitivities of conflict within its choppy story.

                              <span>Marvel Snap is a very good card game that recently left early access and is now playable on Android, iOS, and Steam. However, unlike basically every other digital card game, Snap doesn’t include a mulligan option at the start of the match, letting you ditch some or all of your cards for new cards. But as Ben Brode of…

Then, two years later, it blew up all over again after a bizarre hidden area was discovered in the game, one laced with all kinds of apparent links to ARGs and cults.

Alan Wake (now on the Switch) is psychological horror game about coming to terms with who you are. Many have compared it to Silent Hill 2 for that reason and many others, but for me, the ways that it&#x27;s about internal conflict have always felt more unintentional than that.
Throughout the game, the titular Mr. A. Wake is thrown into nightmare situations that are too bad to believe. Likewise, the game&#x27;s Switch port is technically much, much worse than anyone would have expected.  When it comes to stuff like polygon count, pop-up, frame rate, and just a general sense of jank, this is one of the least polished-looking modern games from a AAA studio I&#x27;ve ever seen. It runs worse than the original 360 version did in 2010. Heck, it even looks a little cruddier than than Sil…</span>

                              <span>BioWare&#x27;s next big RPG is playable start-to-finish now
The next Dragon Age game has passed a big internal milestone. In a new blog, BioWare confirms Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has completed the Alpha milestone.
What this means, effectively, is that Dreadwolf is currently playable from start to finish. This doesn&#x27;t mean the work&#x27;s done quite yet, though.
In a new blog, BioWare general manager Gary McKay says the team is now looking at the narrative cohesion.
&quot;We can take the story we’ve written and see if we’re expressing it well through the characters, dialogue, cinematics, and ultimately, the player’s journey,&quot; said McKay. &quot;Now that we have the ability to do a complete playthrough, we can iterate and polish on the things that matter most to our fans.&quot;
Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is heading to a few new locales. Notably, this includes one fans have heard about more than a few times: the Tevinter Imperium. Today&#x27;s blog confirms players will visit Minrathous, the heart of the Tevinter empire.
McKay continues on to say that the Dreadwolf team wants to &quot;continue being transparent&quot; with fans about development, and keep people up-to-date. So far, the studio has released a few development updates this year. One slapped the official subtitle on Dreadwolf. And another teased some codex entries that are in store.

The Dreadwolf rises
The next installment of Dragon Age was first teased at The Game Awards in 2018. Since then, BioWare&#x27;s been working on it, going through some big shifts in the process.
While we&#x27;ve seen some teases, we&#x27;ve still had yet to see a full look at what&#x27;s in store for the Dragon Age universe. Hopefully, with such a big milestone passed, BioWare will cast more light on the Dread Wolf&#x27;s plans soon.

One of gaming&#x27;s endless wars is set to rage on, and it looks like it&#x27;s time to fuel up the legendary R-9 vessel once again, as Granzella has announced that R-Type Final 3 Evolved is currently in development for PS5. The new remaster has an expected Japanese launch date of March 2023.
R-Type Final 3 Evolved — revealed in the latest issue of Japanese publication Famitsu — is a revamped edition of the 2021 release R-Type Final 2, making the initial title of that game even more ironic than it already was. While details are incredibly slim at this stage, Famitsu reports that Final 3 Evolved will feature improved visuals, online multiplayer lobbies, a selection of mini-games, and an impressive 100 total ships as well as seven all-new stages, making this one of the most feature-packed releases in the iconic Irem franchise.
In addition, Final 3 Evolved will utilize support for the upcoming PSVR2 hardware, allowing players to be immersed in The Bydo Empire battle like never before. I personally cannot wait until the famous boss character Dobkeratops is quite literally assaulting my eyeballs with their eyeballs. While no western localization was announced, such a release remains highly likely, given the appearance of previous titles on North American and European shores. We will be sure to let you know right here on Destructoid when more details are forthcoming.

                              <span>Both are still due on November 18
In what will be one of the last big releases of 2022 (alongside of Midnight Suns and the re-release of Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core in December), Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is approaching very soon. Before then, we have new Scarlet and Violet footage to look over: though it&#x27;s not quite as flashy as it has been presented in the past.
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet lands and towns footage:
This brief clip runs roughly 30 seconds, but has quite a bit of gameplay mixed in, with a focus on open world footage.

My World My Way:
This is the &quot;main&quot; video of the duo drop, with a minute and a half of footage mixed in with some real-life backdrops from the game. If you mute the voiceover, you can see some collected gameplay of Scarlet and Violet dealing with exploration, as well as some combat.
Marketing is really pushing the &quot;your way&quot; angle of exploration, which I hope actually pans out in the full version. They&#x27;re banking hard on this being the first legit open world game, so hopefully there aren&#x27;t many gates or blocks to worry about, and you actually are able to roam around pretty much everywhere you want.

God of War Ragnarok is not far off now, but its photo mode won&#x27;t make it in time for launch.
Sony Santa Monica Studios has confirmed that God of War Ragnarok&#x27;s photo mode won&#x27;t be live at launch. The studio says it will share more details &quot;closer&quot; to when it plans to release it.
https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1585079721020526594
Granted, the Share button on your DualSense or DualShock controller will still work just fine. But there will be a wait for a more elaborate photo mode in God of War Ragnarok, it seems.
The studio also recently released a combat breakdown, showing off some of the enemies Kratos and Atreus will face. It looks like Kratos has some fancy new tools of destruction to take care of them, too.

Ragnarok is coming
We are, at the time of this writing, just about two weeks out from the release of God of War Ragnarok. The follow-up to the God of War 2018 reboot that saw Kratos tackling Norse mythology, rather than Greek, made a pretty big impact.
It&#x27;s a shame we won&#x27;t be seeing a photo mode at launch, considering some of the vistas we&#x27;ve seen so far have already looked spectacular. But Sony games have been historically good at providing elaborate photo mode options, so a little extra time&#x27;s worth the wait for a good tool.
The game&#x27;s gold and the date is set. We&#x27;ll be seeing how the next leg of Kratos and Atreus&#x27; journey, and what looks like a showdown with the Norse thunder god himself, looks like soon. God of War Ragnarok will launch for PS4 and PS5 on November 9.

Koei Tecmo has finally announced an official release date for Team Ninja&#x27;s dark fantasy epic Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty — The hugely challenging Three Kingdoms adaptation will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms on March 3, 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;xlmdeQFyqC0
Wo Long, which was recently bestowed upon Soulslike fans via a PlayStation demo, will task players with building a deadly and stoic warrior, who will then stand against a huge batallion of rogues, demons, and monsters. Utilizing an array of deadly hand-to-hand and weapon-based combat skills, our hero will call upon the power of The Divine Beings in order to infuse their attacks with otherworldly, spiritual powers. Craft your champion across five phases, taking down larger and more destructive forces as their epic journey continues.
Now available to pre-order, eager players can bag the Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Deluxe Digital Edition includes a season pass, containing three post-release DLC expansions — bringing with them additional stages, skills, weapons to swing, and demon heads to be swung upon. Picking up the Deluxe Digital Edition will also bag you a digital art book and soundtrack, as well as the exclusive &quot;Qinglong Armor&quot;. Additionally, all pre-orders of any edition of Wo Long will unlock the exclusive &quot;Baihu Armor&quot;.
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty launches March 3 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

                              <span>Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker are moving on to a new adventure
Rocksteady co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker are leaving the company. The pair announced they will depart Rocksteady at the end of 2022.
In a letter detailing the shift, Rocksteady confirms that founding member and longtime director of production Nathan Burlow will take over as studio director. Darius Sadeghian will take over the role of Studio Product Director.
&quot;With Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League nearly finished, they have both decided to leave Rocksteady at the end of 2022 and will begin a new adventure in gaming,&quot; reads today&#x27;s statement. &quot;We have the utmost respect and gratitude for Jamie and Sefton and wish them all the best in their new endeavor, and like many fans, we look forward to what they do next.&quot;
No word yet on what the duo will go on to do. Today&#x27;s letter says the two will be moving on to a &quot;new adventure&quot; in gaming. Hill and Walker wished Burlow and Sadeghian the best in taking the reins of Rocksteady.
&quot;Now with Suicide Squad in safe hands, and the team here stronger than ever, it&#x27;s time to hand over the reins, and for us to start a new adventure together in games,&quot; wrote Hill and Walker.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;KRKZ1ewc9f0
Keep steady
The duo of Walker and Hill has been behind Rocksteady since it was formed in 2004. The two had previously worked together at Argonaut Games.
The team would go on to kickstart the Batman: Arkham series of games. The Arkham series grew, expanding out to other studios, and has become pretty pivotal for the modern superhero genre.
Rocksteady is currently working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which was pushed out of this year and into spring 2023.

Player First Games has some exciting news for fans of its platform-based brawler, MultiVersus — The studio has announced that a new update is headed to all platforms this week, bringing with it DC Comics&#x27; anti-hero Black Adam, as well as a neat new Arcade Mode for single-player/co-op action.
Debuting way back in 1945&#x27;s The Marvel Family, Black Adam was depicted as a predecessor of Shazam (then Captain Marvel) who had ruled with an iron fist (not with Iron Fist) over ancient Egypt. Eventually banished to a distant galaxy star, Adam would eventually return seeking revenge against Captain Marvel and his kin. In later series, Black Adam would receive a new origin story, involving his Pharoah like burial and resurrection. The character has since gone through a variet…</span>

                              <span>The image posting tool was removed this week
The 3DS and Wii U image posting tool was removed: which itself seems insignificant, but actually highlights the slow, and at times, absurd deaths of the systems.
The news comes straight from Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese customer service Twitter account, which states (translated): &quot;Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U &#x27;image posting tool&#x27; service ended today at 4:00 pm. Images from the Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U cannot be posted after. Images and comments posted on Facebook and Twitter can be viewed on each SNS even after the service ends.&quot; The official end time was October 25 at 4PM JST. So it&#x27;s over!
As you may recall, both of these devices are on the way out, and are being completely disconnected from pretty much every service by 2023. Most of their online functionality was already ripped away, as we move toward the &quot;March 2023&quot; full end date when everything is gone.
It&#x27;s a shame. I get that legacy devices do need to end service at some point. But it&#x27;s funny to boot up some really old devices, and just....game on PC...and see a ton of online functionality alive and well, like nothing changed. I love the Wii U and 3DS to pieces, but the latter in particular has an incredible legacy that Nintendo should forever be proud of. I wish it could live on past March 2023.

                              <span>Fool&#x27;s Theory will remake the first Witcher game
CD Projekt has revealed one of their previously teased projects as a full-fledged remake of the first The Witcher game.
The remake, previously dubbed Project Canis Majoris, is in the early stages of development at Fool&#x27;s Theory, a third-party studio. The team is working on the remake in Unreal Engine 5, with creative supervision from CD Projekt Red, and is using the same tool set as the new Witcher trilogy that&#x27;s in the works.
Fool&#x27;s Theory was formed in 2015 by former Witcher developers, so it&#x27;s a bit of a natural fit. CD Projekt Red head Adam Badowski said the team at Fool&#x27;s Theory knows the source material well, and how to make &quot;incredible and ambitious&quot; games.
&quot;The Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD Projekt Red,&quot; said Badowski. &quot;It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it feels just as big, if not bigger.&quot;

Return to the source
The first The Witcher game stretches back pretty far, first launching in 2007 for the PC. Having personally played a chunk of it, it certainly has some cool ideas, but isn&#x27;t really the series that it would grow into with its sequels.
A rermake of the original certainly seems like an intriguing prospect. No more details were shared today on when this might arrive. But hearing it will also utilize the tools for the next Witcher trilogy is interesting.
There&#x27;s more in development at CD Projekt, too. The aforementioned new trilogy for The Witcher is one part, as is a new Witcher project from The Molasses Flood. And on the more futuristic side of things, CD Projekt is also working on the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077.

Muttley is an all-time best-dog in cartoons, and now it seems like everyone is ready to embrace this new good boy in Pokemon. Following a viral campaign from The Pokemon Company advertising that something was going to happen on October 25, we just got a new Pokemon reveal: in the style of a found footage video. Yep, it&#x27;s a new Pokemon dog.

Thanks to some post-video info dumps, we know that it&#x27;s a ghost-type Pokemon named Greavard, and that it seems to resemble a design that&#x27;s a cross between Litwick and a dog. It also possibly murdered the trainer in the video, and potentially has an &quot;energy vampire&quot; type aura.
Based on the official description, I was right!
&quot;Greavard is friendly and affectionate, willing to follow Trainers no matter where they go with its hand…</span>

There must come a time when a prominent leaker becomes so expected that they might as well be hired by the publisher — Such is the case of leak-like-clockwork Dealabs user billbil-kun, who is once again out of the gate early with the PlayStation Plus Essential titles heading to all subscribers in November.
According to billbil-kun, next month will see PS Plus gain access to three new games: Team Ninja&#x27;s celebrated action-RPG Nioh 2 (PS4/PS5), intergalactic gravity challenge Heavenly Bodies (PS4/PS5), and block-based adventure LEGO Harry Potter Collection (PS4). The three titles should be available to download from the first week in November.

Playing Beacon Pines feels a bit like early winter nights, where you’re surprised by how quick the darkness creeps up – yet comfy and warm under a blanket.
Coming from indie developer Hiding Spot, the setting might look like your usual cute woodsy town populated by anthropomorphic animals, but there’s a dark terror lurking beneath. Like its colourful story, Beacon Pines doesn’t belong to just one genre. The game is visual-novel-meets-exploration, with sparks of choose-your-own-adventure.

Forget Capcom giants like Resident Evil and Monster Hunter for a second — Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins Resurrection saw the return of Sir Arthur after a ten-year absence in 2021, and it was a pretty darn good return to form, that form being &quot;very difficult&quot;. In fact, we specifically said this revival was &quot;So immorally brutal on higher tier difficulty levels&quot; in our review. Ouch!
But Capcom has partnered with Dream Figures to make us remember the pain, or the glory, to create some stunning Sir Arthur statues. And the creator of the series rightly shared these figures on Twitter today, because what would make a better Halloween present than a Sir Arthur statue?

As if picking your starter Pokémon wasn&#x27;t already a difficult enough decision, Sanei Boeki has announced a line of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet plushies modelled on the game&#x27;s leading trio, making that all-important choice a whole lot harder.
The Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly plushies join the company&#x27;s &#x27;All Star Collection&#x27; and yes, they look very, very cuddly. The plushies will be available in two different sizes, with the larger model coming in at around 35cm in height, while the smaller is just a little guy at around 12cm and features a chain so it can hang on your keys or bag.

Nintendo has temporarily removed Rainmaker from the Anarchy Battle rotation in Splatoon 3, as the company has discovered a bug that can reduce your score to &#x27;1&#x27; when you touch a checkpoint. Not exactly ideal for competition!
This has been reported today after version 1.2.0 for Splatoon 3 went live, and Nintendo has apologised for the issue. To fix the big, the company has pulled Rainmaker from the rotation, so you&#x27;ll be temporarily unable to play it in Splatoon 3&#x27;s ranked mode.

Pink Gorilla Games, the famous Seattle-based retro gaming store, has been subjected to armed robbery, forcing the owners to consider relocating after 17 years.
As reported by our friends over at Time Extension, the incident occured on Monday night, during which a hooded and masked man demanded money and collectible cards after pretending to check out. He allegedly repeatedly asked the store assistants for a bag before branishing a firearm.

Would it really be another year of gaming without a new edition of Skyrim coming out? For those who missed it, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition flew over to Switch last month as either a bundle in and of itself or as an add-on purchase for those who already owned the game, and some players were disappointed to experience the title occasionally drop to 15-20fps in certain areas.
We didn&#x27;t run into any performance issues in our review of the Anniversary Edition, but others were not so lucky. Fortunately, it looks like a new patch dropped for the game last week and the frame rate seems to have improved because of it.

                              <span>Still stuck in the &#x27;90s.
The Oddworld series has never quite evolved past its late 1990s roots; the grimy puzzle-platformer was a unique take on the genre for its time, yet hasn’t really made a mark with the handful of releases and ports since its debut. A shame, as Oddworld, with its Mudokon slaves, the half-mechanical Sligs, and industrialist Glukkons, is a place we enjoy spending time in – even if it’s a little depressing and grotesque. The most recent entry, 2021’s Oddworld: Soulstorm, came as a reimagined version of 1998’s Abe’s Exoddus on PS1. Now, Soulstorm has arrived on Switch with a handful of improvements.
Our sister website Push Square enjoyed Soulstorm about as much as antagonist Molluck the Glukkon likes our protagonist Abe – which, if you’re unfamiliar with Oddworld, is not very much. Bugs, clunky gameplay, and a lack of a fart button were among its issues, yet the Switch’s Oddtimized Edition promises to fix some of these issues, particularly the AI. The good news for Oddworld fans is that this promise has been fulfilled in some key areas. The bad news is that significant issues still abound.

Here&#x27;s the video game-to-book adaptation you never knew you wanted — Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet, 2022&#x27;s adorable, snack-based party game featuring the pink puffball, is getting its own novel in Japan, Automaton Media reports.
Yep, really. We know that Kirby games can get wild with their lore, but Dream Buffet certainly isn&#x27;t the first slice of the pie we&#x27;d think of when considering which Kirby games to adapt into a novel. But it&#x27;s getting one. A game where you roll around and try to eat as many sweet treats as possible is getting a novel — not a cookbook! As an aside, we&#x27;d love a Kirby cookbook, but let&#x27;s get down to business here — why Kirby&#x27;s Dream Buffet? Well, it&#x27;s actually pretty simple — Kirby actually has an entire light novel series in Japan, written by Mie Takase.

                              <span>Sure looks like it, though.
We all love a bit of fishing in our video games, right? Well, you&#x27;re in luck, because Bandai Namco Entertainment is about to launch Ace Angler: Fishing Spirits on Nintendo Switch, a game packed to the rim with sharks, frogs, turtles, octopi, and much more. In short, everything you could hope for if you like to just kick back and reel in a few fishies.
What we can&#x27;t quite get over, however, is just how similar it looks to Animal Crossing, at least in terms of aesthetics. Just look at those characters! They look like they&#x27;ve been plucked straight out of a bunch of Animal Crossing villages and dropped into Ace Angler. It&#x27;s not a bad thing, of course; the design choice arguably fits the tone of the game to a tee, and you can even explore a fully formed Aquarium, just like the museum in New Horizons.

Tomorrow (27th October) will see the Switch debut of Signalis - a low-poly horror survival game from newcomers rose-engine and publisher Humble Games. The game will be available on the Switch eShop for £15.99 / 19.99€ and based on its reviews, this sounds like we are in for a bargain.
Our friends over at Push Square gave Signalis a solid 8/10 in its review, describing the title as &#x27;an astoundingly stylish effort from such a small studio.&#x27; There isn&#x27;t a lot of discussion of the Switch port as of yet, though the game&#x27;s visual style has us hoping that it plays as good as it looks.

Last month, Nintendo revealed it would be discontinuing two more 3DS and Wii U features on 25th October 2022.
It&#x27;s now officially past this point in certain locations around the world, and this means the Image Share feature is no longer available on both of these devices. To remind everyone, Nintendo&#x27;s Japanese social media accounts have shared the following message. Here&#x27;s a rough Google translation:

Companies are always adding support for various wireless devices and controllers, and this time it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s turn. The latest update for iOS 16.1 has added support for the Nintendo Switch Online classic controllers.
Based on tests so far, it seems the SNES and N64 wireless controllers work. It&#x27;s not been confirmed just yet if the same applies to the NES and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive wireless controllers. Here&#x27;s a demo of this new feature for iOS 16.1, courtesy of developer Steven Troughton-Smith on Twitter:

Verification ticks are an important part of social media and websites like YouTube nowadays - allowing users to easily identify legitimate channels and accounts. With this in mind, it seems Nintendo&#x27;s American YouTube channel has recently lost its tick.
As highlighted in a post on the Nintendo subreddit (via GoNintendo), the Nintendo channel for America, simply called &quot;Nintendo&quot; has recently been renamed to &quot;Nintendo of America&quot;. In the process, it has lost its verification badge.

In response, an impressive 15% decided to go legal, but others weren&#x27;t so readily converted. Close to half migrated to other pirate sites, with around 12% of blocked pirates deploying VPNs or modified DNS settings.

                              <span>Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have announced that they are departing from the studio. 
This news comes as a bit of a surprise, both because Hill was the director of the studio&#x27;s upcoming game, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and because both were original founders of the studio and masterminds behind its popular Batman Arkham series. Nonetheless, it seems the two are leaving Rocksteady amicably at the end of the year with confidence in the team they&#x27;re leaving behind to carry Suicide Squad across the finish line.

                              <span>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red announced that it was developing a new Cyberpunk game, multiple Witcher games, and a new IP. One of those Witcher games was given the codename &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; and CDPR called it a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Witcher title. Now, the company has revealed that &quot;Canis Majoris&quot; is actually a remake of the very first Witcher game. 
The official Witcher Twitter account posted the news this morning, revealing that CDPR is working with developer Fool&#x27;s Theory to make The Witcher using Unreal Engine 5. Fool&#x27;s Theory developed Seven Enhanced Edition and Seven Drowned Pass, but it has also provided developmental support on games like Divinity: Original Sin II, Baldur&#x27;s Gate III, and Outriders.

                              <span>Team Ninja has revealed the release date for its upcoming action game set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and it&#x27;s less than half a year away. 
More specifically, the studio has revealed that Wo Long will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on March 3, 2023. That&#x27;s less than six months away. Alongside this news, Team Ninja has detailed the editions of Wo Long you can preorder as well as some of the DLC coming to the game.


Let&#x27;s break those editions down: 
Standard Edition
The physical version of the game will include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus.
The digital version of the game will include the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus and the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Steelbook Launch Edition
The steelbook launch edition of the game will include Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a collector&#x27;s steelbook (yet to be revealed), and the Crown of Zhurong and Crown of Gonggong bonus DLC. It will also include the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus. 
Digital Deluxe Edition
The digital deluxe edition will include a digital copy of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a digital art book, a digital mini soundtrack, and the game&#x27;s season pass. It will also include the Quinglong armor as a season pass bonus, the Baihu armor as an early purchase bonus, and the Zhuque armor as a digital pre-order bonus. 
DLC
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty will have a season pass and it will include three pieces of DLC, although Team Ninja has not detailed what to expect just yet. You can also buy these DLCs individually. Anyone that purchases the season pass will get the Qinglong armor as a bonus.

Fallout has been one of the most iconic series in all of gaming for decades now, so it was only a matter of time before it got a proper game-to-television adaptation. We got the news that Amazon would be helming the project all the way back in July of 2020, and it&#x27;s being developed by Westworld creator Lisa Joy and writer-director Jonathan Nolan (also known as the brother of famed director Christopher Nolan). It&#x27;s been radio silence on the series for quite a while, which is why it&#x27;s so exciting to get a first look at the series today on Twitter.
Today actually happens to be the 25th anniversary of the series as well, so in honor of Fallout&#x27;s birthday, Amazon Prime posted a tweet featuring a screenshot from the show. The image features two figur…</span>

Owlcat Games is planning on more Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous content. Today, the studio laid out its plans for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&#x27; Season 2 Pass, which will have three new pieces of DLC for the RPG.
In a video today, creative director Alexander Mishulin discusses the upcoming DLC. Owlcat put a survey in the field, and the studio says it got over 30,000 responses on what players want from more Wrath of the Righteous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;f-fkebaHP9g
The result? This set of three DLC, currently labelled DLC 4, 5, and 6. Here&#x27;s the rundown of each.
Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Season 2 Pass DLC
DLC #4: A new companion joins the party, showcasing the new playable class for the DLC: the ever-changing Shifter. They&#x27;re physical brawlers who take on bestial aspects. New love may even await.
DLC #5: A standalone campaign that picks up from where Through the Ashes, a previous self-contained mini-campaign, left off. It offers a six-to-seven hour independent campaign, featuring a regular group of adventurers. And once you&#x27;re done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be available to explore.
DLC #6: The Knight Commander and crew return to Kenabres for some unfinished business: actual rest and relaxation. A new festival is in the works, and there&#x27;s plenty of opportunities to hang out with companions and your loved one. Though, you might want to keep an eye out for secret developments.
The Season 2 Pass for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will go for $29.99, and is available to pre-order for PC players now. It doesn&#x27;t look like a release plan has been set out yet for the new content.
Owlcat&#x27;s Wrath of the Righteous recently launched onto consoles, which also upgraded the PC version to the Enhanced Edition. And even with another RPG in the oven, it&#x27;s nice to see Owlcat continuing to bulk out an already sizable RPG offering.

                              <span>Plus, Age of Mythology is getting &quot;retold&quot;
Xbox owners are getting some historical strategy in 2023. Microsoft and World&#x27;s Edge announced today that Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition and Age of Empires IV are both making their way to Xbox consoles.
The two strategy games are expected to hit Xbox in 2023. For Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, World&#x27;s Edge has a date set for January 31, 2023. Age of Empires IV, meanwhile, will aim for Xbox consoles later in 2023.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;1cZTqd6BEIY
In an Xbox Wire post, World&#x27;s Edge confirms that the team has been specifically working on the controller experience. The team is specifically crafting a tutorial for controller input, paired with a new user experience.
A new game AI is also included, which the team says helps make resource management &quot;efficient and intuitive.&quot;
If controller isn&#x27;t your thing though, keyboard and mouse inputs will be supported in the Xbox versions.
Keep it on the down-wololo
The Age of Empires II Xbox release will include all the Definitive Edition content since 2019. Alongside the DLC that adds new campaigns and civilizations, there have also been tons of updates over the years.
According to World&#x27;s Edge, the versions will also have optional cross-play. This will let PC and Xbox players raise armies against each other, and the team is also aiming to bring AOE to Xbox cloud gaming. So yes, you will be able to lead a war elephant charge on the go at some point in the future.
More is on the way too, as Age of Mythology Retold is in production. From the sounds of it, it&#x27;s an updated version of the original with updated graphics and features. Old-school RTS fans seem to have a good deal to look forward to in the future.

                              <span>I hope we get a single player version of this region eventually
Bethesda has given us a glimpse into more Fallout 76 concept art, thanks to a special (SPECIAL) post on their blog this week.
As the blog suggests, and as is usually the case with concept art, a ton of potential ideas were sketched on various canvases:
&quot;Hundreds – if not thousands – of individual pieces, from napkin sketches to entire painted landscapes, are created when crafting the world of a Fallout game. Concept art like this not only gives the developers details for making assets, they help set the look, feel and tone of the world players are about to inhabit.&quot;

In a small series of &quot;never-before-released&quot; concept art, we got to see a Scorchbeast, as well as the emergence from Vault 76, a look at The Pitt, and some environmental designs. The last piece, a collage of life in a vault, looks lovely. The blog concludes with a link to Adam Adamowicz&#x27;s concept art gallery on Flickr, who provided a lot of the artistry for Fallout 3.
While Fallout 76 has made big strides since its tumultuous launch, this concept art really showcases how much potential an Appalachian fully-fledged, kept-in-the-oven-until-it-was-done new Fallout could have been. It could take a while, but I hope that Fallout 76 isn&#x27;t the last we&#x27;ve seen of this region. I guess there&#x27;s always an opportunity for DLC in some far future Fallout iteration.

                              <span>The stakes are high
It&#x27;s that spooky, scary time of year, and Arkane is ringing in the season with a new look at its own scary project. Bethesda and Arkane dropped a new trailer for upcoming co-op shooter Redfall today, spotlighting the bloodsuckers terrorizing the town.
Today&#x27;s official &quot;Into the Night&quot; trailer takes us into the heart of Redfall, which is having a bit of a vampire problem. We see firsthand how the invasion has torn apart the city, and see some in-first-person gameplay of dealing with one of the creatures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yi3iVpiitD8
While it&#x27;s definitely got some Left 4 Dead vibes, I like the use of vampires here. These enemies grabbing and biting allies could make for some good panic moments. And the mix of genuine horror and retro-throwback atmosphere goes well with the &quot;Visit Redfall&quot; set-up of the whole showcase.
Bite back
Redfall is the newest game from Arkane, with the Austin studio leading up development on the project. It was originally set for a 2022 release, until it got pushed back alongside another Bethesda project, Starfield.
We&#x27;ve still seen some glimpses and heard from the developers about what, exactly, Redfall is shaping up to be. It looks to be a first-person, co-op experience where four different characters have to take on the vampiric infestation of Redfall.
Each character brings their own special weapons to the party. And what vampire fight would be complete without stakes? In today&#x27;s trailer, we get to see a stake bayonet in action, even.
Redfall is currently set for a 2023 launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

You know how the saying goes: you fix one thing, you break two more. From Software games are pretty huge, and as a result, tweaks in one patch may have rippling effects on some small part of their games. Elden Ring is one of the biggest projects they&#x27;ve undertaken, so another minor Elden Ring patch is a given.
Released this morning, the 1.07.1 patch chiefly deals with Endure (an Ash of War), and nerfs it, following a &quot;greater impact on game balance than expected.&quot; Reading between the lines, the team overbuffed Endure, and allowed it to become one of the most formidable abilities in the game, tanking damage without a sweat (you can see how this played out in the video below). It also addresses Inescapable Frenzy (and an FP consumption bug).

                              <span>The upcoming amiibo trio are now implemented
Splatoon 3 version 1.2.0 Nintendo Support: How to Update Splatoon 3, and it&#x27;s a big one: one of the biggest patches in Splatoon history, actually.
There&#x27;s a few aspects of this patch that we can break down individually.
More amiibo support
For one, amiibo support is in for the Inkling (Yellow), Octoling (Blue) and Smallfry figures. Those will arrive in several weeks, on November 11.
Faster data transfer
Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of how Nintendo is summing up the new data transfer improvements:
On average, data will be transferred about 0.5 seconds more quickly than before. Users can expect to see a reduction in time it takes from a player being dealt damage to them being defeated, the time it takes from touching a golden egg to actually picking it up, and other similar actions.
Tons of fixes
The biggest part of the Splatoon 3 1.2.0 patch is fixes! And tons of them! There&#x27;s over 100 in tow, including alterations to multiplayer and story mode.
While not strictly limited to the fixes portion of the patch notes, the team also &quot;improved the efficiency of matchmaking&quot; for anarchy battles (open and series), as well as splatfest battles (open) and tricolor attack. Simply put, this should theoretically lead to &quot;shorter wait times.&quot;
What&#x27;s in store for the future?
Nintendo says that &quot;the next update,&quot; which is slated for &quot;the season beginning in December,&quot; will usher in weapon balance changes, as well as more meaningful changes to the Splatfest Tricolor Attack mode. It will be released &quot;at the end of the current season.&quot;

There are so many places I could start with Signalis, that it&#x27;s hard to know just where. Maybe it&#x27;s the long, ominous shadows that often hid an enemy from my sight. The horrifying creatures, waiting to shriek and charge at me. Maybe it&#x27;s the incredible style, or the music, or the intricate, tactile puzzles.
It is really hard to succinctly explain what&#x27;s so striking about Signalis. In a span of nine or so hours, I went on a trek deeper and deeper down, scraping through layers of steel and concrete until I reached the earth&#x27;s flesh, to find the forbidden truths that both my avatar and I sought. It was perilous and emotional, gorgeous and terrifying.

For me, I keep thinking back to the tension I felt in save rooms. I&#x27;m standing over a storage box, counting how many …</span>

A Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope patch is out day one, and although it clocks in at just 130MB comparatively, it has a lot to address. Like, a lot!
Billed as a non-mandatory patch but &quot;recommended,&quot; this one hits everything from framerate fixes, to individual and obscure bugs that could cause progression issues. It gets even more granular once you hit the battle bugs, like separate abilities not quite doing the damage they should: which is super hard to suss out on your own. Those are some of the worst bugs in a combat-focused game, as you could be inadvertently holding yourself back with some tactics through no fault of your own.
Beyond that you should have less crashes or &quot;force quits&quot; (as the patch notes call them, when the game brings you back to the title screen) during certain circumstances. Or even &quot;buttons pressed in quick succession!&quot; Just take a look at the massive tome below!

When I first heard that Gungrave was coming back with not one, but two projects, I was in shock. This is a series that felt buried roughly two decades ago after Gungrave: Overdose on the PS2, but nonetheless we got a so-so VR adaptation, and very soon: Gungrave GORE.
We had a chance to play a preview build, and it feels like a blast from the past (in ways that will both delight and disappoint).

One thing I swiftly noticed after starting up Gungrave GORE is how much it asks you to already be somewhat invested in the lore. The quick intro was partially incomprehensible for newcomers, with a lot of exposition required, and less emotional resonance. What you mostly need to know is that anti-hero Grave is trying to kill the Ravenclan, led by four eccentric bosses who, i…</span>

Bayonetta 1 and 2 are up there with Devil May Cry 3 and Ninja Gaiden Black as one of a select few all-time action greats. There&#x27;s a strong case that until Devil May Cry 5 came along, Platinum was practically peerless in the contemporary action space. Now, we have Bayonetta 3.
So how do you follow up on prior perfection? More of it.

Bayonetta 3 (Switch [reviewed])
Developer: Platinum Games
Publisher: Nintendo
Released: October 28, 2022
MSRP: $59.99
Bayonetta 3 starts with Bayonetta getting her ass kicked without context; which is a pretty great way to kick off an action game. We&#x27;re immediately introduced to newcomer Viola, who has an appropriate punk vibe, looking to make a name for herself and earn the respect of Bayonetta while saving the world.

                              <span>A battle for every area
Bandai Namco Entertainment has put out a new gameplay showcase for One Piece Odyssey, where we get a good glimpse of how the Straw Hat Pirates fight their turn-based RPG battles.
Before the fighting starts, we do get a look at the locale for the new adventure. One Piece Odyssey follows Monkey D. Luffy and the crew in a journey after they&#x27;re shipwrecked at sea.
In the trailer today, we see the city of Alabasta and some of the locales the pirates will run through. Each character has an overworld ability, allowing them to access certain areas or take advantage of certain resources. From being stretchy or handy with a slingshot to just being small, everyone has their own talent for navigating the island.

All&#x27;s fair in turn-based battles
Once the fighting starts, the crew dukes it out in a traditional RPG style. It&#x27;s got a traditional vibe to it, with a little bit of One Piece style.
It looks like one of Odyssey&#x27;s battle mechanics is the scramble area battle, where characters are placed in different zones to duke it out. Some characters are able to attack other areas from long-range, and it looks like fighters can also move from one area to another one their own is clear.

Basically, an all-out brawl. But with type effectiveness and other factors in play, it seems like an interesting battle system that could make for fun combat encounters. I dig the idea of the crew getting split and having to fight their way back together. Plus, there are some conditions called Dramatic Scenes that give extra rewards for clearing them.
I&#x27;m not a huge One Piece fan, but this look at the battle set-up has me intrigued. We&#x27;ll see how Luffy and the crew&#x27;s battles turn out in this new RPG when One Piece Odyssey launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 13, 2023.

Overwatch 2 is ringing in the season of scares with a return to Halloween Terror, its annual Halloween event. The festivities kick off tomorrow, October 25, and run through November 9.
A new limited time co-op mission is in store for this year, dubbed Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride. The bride, as you can tell from the images, is a special Sombra skin.
With every new event comes a bevy of cosmetics, to both unlock and purchase in Overwatch 2. Special challenges will unlock rewards like a name card, weapon charm, and some Battle Pass XP if you&#x27;re still working on it.

                              <span>AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 7000 processors are brilliant, often beating Intel 12th-gen offerings and drawing close with 13th-gen, while offering support for PCIe 5.0 SSDs, DDR5 RAM and a brand new AM5 socket. For content creation, they&#x27;re by far the best CPUs AMD has ever produced - but for gaming, there is another option: the Ryzen 7 5800X3D. This CPU remains stunningly fast in some games that can take advantage of its uniquely huge L3 cache, and best of all works with a wide range of inexpensive AM4 motherboards with cheap DDR4 RAM. 
Pound for pound, it&#x27;s by far the best AMD CPU for gaming on the market - and now it&#x27;s been reduced to just $329 at Antonline via Ebay. That&#x27;s a healthy $120 reduction from its US MSRP of $449, and a great price overall given the level of gaming performance it provides.

                              <span>Today marks the 25th anniversary of strategy classic Age Of Empires, and to celebrate Xbox Game Studios have announced a ream of updates coming to Age Of Empires II: Definitive Edition next year. Technically, the main bit of news from tonight&#x27;s anniversary stream is that both Age Of Empires II: DE and Age Of Empires IV will be arriving on Xbox consoles in 2023 (that, and Age Of Mythology is coming back), but the upshot of all that is that the PC versions will be getting the very same benefits, including controller support, crossplay with consoles and cloud gaming support.

                              <span>Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.
If you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you&#x27;re looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam&#x27;s done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.

                              <span>Shareware platformers defined my PC gaming as a kid. Yeah, a cheeky blast on Wolfenstein 3D was okay, but Commander Keen and Duke Nukem were an amazing discovery for a small person who’d been introduced to games through the NES. One of my all-time favourites is Apogee’s Crystal Caves, a gem of a platformer about an interstellar miner who goes space spelunking in search of alien crystals.

                              <span>It’s been two years since developer Origame Digital released the beloved photography game Umurangi Generation and since then, the team have been relatively quiet. That all changed over the weekend when Umurangi’s composer, ThorHighHeels, posted a YouTube video showcasing three obscure horror games. A short teaser for Origame’s FiveSeven was mysteriously tucked in the middle of it.

                              <span>Last week I reviewed New Tales From The Borderlands and I really didn&#x27;t like it. This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don&#x27;t want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).
As it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I&#x27;m not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I&#x27;d sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn&#x27;t played it for a while. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t how I remembered. Maybe I&#x27;d changed, you know?

                              <span>When Adam Isgreen, creative director at World’s Edge, first played the Age Of Empires series, he was still working at Westwood Studios on Command &amp; Conquer. “The first thing I was impressed about more than anything with this series was just like, wow! History! That&#x27;s really smart,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Like, there&#x27;s no need to explain anything to people. You don&#x27;t have to be like, oh, there&#x27;s a laser gun or this is a magic missile. It&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”


To Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it&#x27;s just outlasted everything else.”

Back in January, FromSoftware deactivated online features for the Dark Souls trilogy on PC due to the prominence of hackers and security concerns. Recently, Dark Souls III servers were reactivated (before being deactivated and reactivated again) and now it&#x27;s Dark Souls II’s turn. The base version of Dark Souls II will have these features “made available at a later date,&quot; but for now, Scholar Of The First Sin players can continue to invade the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and scribble down messages for others.

                              <span>The Activision Blizzard King Workers Alliance have teamed up with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union to file another charge of unfair labour practices against Activision Blizzard. The filing is in response to a message described as anti-union that was sent by Activision Blizzard’s communications executive, Lulu Meservey, to 18,000 employees last week. The CWA had previously filed a charge of unfair labour practices in September 2021, accusing the company of violating US labour laws and stopping employees from discussing working conditions. Last year’s complaint was closed just a month later.

Alright, here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing: playing Greaser, a wee free visual novel about riding a Cronenbergian biomechanical motorbike along an endless unreal desert highway. It&#x27;s playable in your browser so kick-start on over to Itch.io right now. I don&#x27;t know what else you&#x27;re doing this morning that&#x27;ll get your engine running more than adventure, self-discovery, and erotic motorbike maintenance.

Despite this big news, discussion around the event has focused on EA’s lack of community representation, as they only included one “black simmer” onscreen during a stream full of other content creators.

Bethesda Game Studios announced back in 2020 that it was teaming up with Amazon Studios and Kilter Films to develop a Fallout TV series. Early details revealed that Westworld creators and producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy signed onto the project and are partnering with Fallout 4 director and long-time Bethesda producer Todd Howard to bring the show to life.
Since then, not much else has been released except a 2021 report that details the show as a &quot;gonzo, crazy, funny adventure&quot; and some leaked set photos that reveal some pretty accurate set designs and costumes. However, today, in celebration of Fallout&#x27;s …</span>

                              <span>The Age of Empires series is coming to Xbox; well, some of it at least. 
More specifically, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, the 2019 remaster of the original 1999 Age of Empires II release, is coming to Xbox consoles on January 31, 2023, and it will be followed by an Xbox release of Age of Empires IV later that year. This news came alongside various Age of Empires-related news announced today as part of the series&#x27; 25th Anniversary celebrations. 
Check out the announcement video for yourself below: 


That&#x27;s not all that was revealed today, though. If you&#x27;re an Age of Empires fiend, check out this video breaking down the history of the series that the Xbox and the Age of Empires team released today: 


Xbox, World&#x27;s Edge, and Relic Entertainment have also revealed Age of Mythology Retold, a definitive edition of the Age of Empires spin-off series first released in 2002. Check out its reveal trailer below: 


&quot;Age of Mythology Retold is in production,&quot; the announcement reads. &quot;We know that the Age of Mythology community has been waiting hopefully for a Definitive Edition, and we&#x27;ll be delivering. We&#x27;re working hard to bring you the glory of the original game with updated graphics, features, and more.&quot; 
Next up is the reveal that Age of Empires is heading to mobile devices. Not much was revealed, but you can check out the teaser trailer for the game below:

                              <span>A trailer from the Pokémon Company International has revealed the Greavard, the Ghost Dog Pokémon, just in time for Halloween. You can watch the official reveal below.


On Twitter, the official Pokémon account describes this haunted hound with the following Pokédex-like entry:
That second sentence ties into the first part of this reveal – an animated video posted on the Pokémon YouTube Channel about a trainer searching the Paldea region for ghost-type Pokémon. They eventually stumble upon a Greavard, but mysteriously collapse after playing fetch.
Greavard’s reveal continues a trend in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s marketing campaign where they post animated teasers and reveals of each new monster coming to the games. It started with Grafaiai and has continued all the way up to Bellibolt, a Pokémon revealed less than two weeks ago.

                              <span>Bethesda revealed Arkane Studios&#x27; open-world, co-op FPS Redfall back in 2021, and since then, the companies have been slowly pulling back the curtain on what to expect in this vampire-infested experience. We&#x27;ve received new trailers, details about how campaign progress is tied to the host in co-op, and we&#x27;ve even previewed the game (read here). 
Now, Bethesda and Arkane have released a new &quot;Into The Night&quot; Redfall trailer inviting players to experience a night out on the town to discover all the (bloody) fun that awaits. Spoilers: there&#x27;s a lot of blood, a lot of vampires, and at least one giant heart that we probably need to destroy. Check out the new Redfall trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, Redfall continues to look like good fun. Today&#x27;s trailer makes me wish this game was coming out this month – it&#x27;d be such a great Halloween game – but it&#x27;s not due out until sometime during the first half of 2023. It will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, as well as Xbox and PC Game Pass when it&#x27;s released. For more information, be sure to check out Game Informer&#x27;s Redfall hub.

By the end of Bayonetta 3&#x27;s third chapter, it&#x27;s operating on a scale that dwarfs most video games. Buildings twist and crumble like flimsy plastic, giant craters pock-mark the earth, and mountain-sized creatures level entire cities; the bombastic culmination of an opening three hours that feel like they&#x27;re running a mile a minute; a never-ending barrage of stimuli.
It&#x27;s loud, obnoxious, and frankly a bit exhausting. And I was hootin&#x27; and hollerin&#x27; the entire time. 
The Bayonetta series has always been at its best when you&#x27;re staring slack-jawed at your TV, repeated…</span>

                              <span>Cult of the Lamb was released back in August and while the main story will run you a dozen or so hours, developer Massive Monsters are inviting you back to your base of operations with a new Blood Moon Festival update that&#x27;s now live. 
This limited-time event began yesterday (October 24) and will run until November 10. It brings plenty of new with it, too, so you&#x27;ll want to jump in to check out all of the Blood Moon&#x27;s offerings before it&#x27;s too late. Here&#x27;s what to expect:
New Blood Moon Ritual
3 New Follower Forms to unlock
4 Base Decorations to unlock
New music track
To accompany the news, Massive Monsters have also released a new trailer for Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s Blood Moon Festival update that you can watch below: 


&quot;Under the light of the Blood Moon, devotees can harvest pumpkins to unlock a brand new ritual that will raise former members of their cult, casting them back to the land of the living as wandering spirits,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;New follower forms and dreadful decorations will be granted upon their capture, but be quick about it, the Blood Moon will wane on November 10.&quot;

                              <span>One of Overwatch&#x27;s most popular annual events was Halloween Terror, which brought not only Halloween-inspired skins and rewards to the game&#x27;s loot box system but a unique PvE experience. 
Halloween Terror has returned, this time to Overwatch 2 and much like the years of experiences before it, this year&#x27;s event comes with skins, rewards, and a semi-sequel to the first game&#x27;s Halloween PvE experience, Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge. The new PvE mode for Overwatch 2 is now called Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge: Wrath of the Bride and you can jump in starting today, October 25.

&quot;Return to Adlersbrunn alongside four fresh faces to experience an all-new story as the Bride of Junkenstein seeks vengeance upon those responsible for the death of her creator,&quot; a blog post about the limited-time co-op mission reads. &quot;Complete challenges to unlock special rewards like the Nightfall Over Adlersbrunn Name Card, the Jack-o&#x27;-Lantern Weapon Charm, Battle Pass XP, and other spine-tingling rewards. Dr. Junkenstein will also be making a grand reappearance in the original Junkenstein&#x27;s Revenge co-op Brawl, returning for a limited time to Halloween Terror 2022.&quot; 
Halloween Terror will run until 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, November 1. If you watch two hours of streams on the Overwatch 2 category on Twitch, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Spray and if you watch four, you&#x27;ll receive the Werewolf Winston Legendary Skin (pictured above). 
Alongside this event, Blizzard is also running a Double Match XP weekend for Overwatch 2 starting October 28 and lasting until October 31. All players who login to Overwatch 2 sometime during the Halloween Terror event through the end of Season One will receive the Cursed Captain Reaper Legendary Skin and Health Pack Weapon Charm as well.

The dated article contains allegations of extortion-like business practices by piracy-tracking outfit Rightscorp. The music companies label the blog as an unreliable &quot;pro-piracy&quot; source. Grande, meanwhile, notes that the article was valuable enough to be documented by Warner&#x27;s anti-piracy expert.

Just recently we saw the anniversary of The Mummy Demastered, an example of a great game based on the most mediocre of movies. Historically, licensed games — usually movie tie-ins — haven&#x27;t enjoyed the best of reputations due to them often being rush jobs thrown together on a shoestring by an under-resourced developer crunching their socks off to make the movie&#x27;s release date and, presumably, capitalise on some cross-media marketing synergy and whatnot.
Of course, there are games like GoldenEye 007 that arrived spectacularly late (21 months after the movie!) and proved that a quality game can stand on its own two feet, but despite a general improvement in quality when it comes to licensed games on consoles, there&#x27;s still a stigma around them. Licensed games are bad is the prevailing mindset, even if &#x27;average&#x27; would be a more appropriate adjective.

After the slight delay of last week&#x27;s UK boxed charts, you would be forgiven for thinking that this week&#x27;s may be much of the same again; but with a whole bunch of new releases, the data has been well and truly shaken up.
Yes, FIFA 23 still holds onto the top spot like a leech, but this week has seen two great openings for Nintendo. Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes straight out of the gates in at number three, proving itself to be a franchise which is ever-growing in popularity despite being a somewhat unusual pitch, and Persona 5 Royal lands the number six spot with an impressive 79% of sales coming from the Switch (Playstation 5 made up 17% while Xbox Series X|S accounted for 4%).

We are glad that Bayonetta 3 is almost out. After a full week of back and forth controversy, the game will soon be able to stand on its own merit and be judged accordingly - and boy, oh boy has it been judged. We have been through the reviews from a whole host of outlets to give you the full rundown of the critical consensus, but was all that drama really worth it? Welcome to our latest reviews round up!
Before we dive into what other critics are saying, let&#x27;s catch everyone up on our Bayonetta 3 review. Simply put, we thought that the game was outstanding, granting it a 10/10 rating and describing it with the following accolade:

This is the second time the RPS Treehouse has gathered together to hash out our collective Bestest Bests from across the ages, and lemme tell you, this year&#x27;s list has seen tons of movement compared to last year&#x27;s ranking. Not only are there buckets of new entries, but there&#x27;s been plenty of upward and downward shuffling of old favourites, too. So come on in and find out what&#x27;s made the cut.

                              <span>The Radeon RX 6950 XT is the fastest AMD graphics card in the world, and will remain so until at least November when AMD is expected to announce a new range of next-gen GPUs. It originally debuted at $1000, undercutting the RTX 3090 Ti at $1500, but third-party models could cost much more - such as this $1200 PowerColor Red Devil. Today though, with that whole &#x27;impending release of better graphics cards&#x27; thing, the 6950 XT is down to $800 at Amazon, which is an awesome deal for the level of graphics performance on offer.

                              <span>Folks, I’ve got some bad news. Victoria 3 is not a game where you play the clone of the clone of Posh Spice. I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.
Trying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.

                              <span>The Corsair 5000D is a rather good PC case, but as it&#x27;s fairly new it&#x27;s normally quite expensive - like $165 on Amazon expensive. So it brings me good cheer to announce that Woot are doing the case in white or black for just $99.99, the lowest price we&#x27;ve ever recorded for this model.

                              <span>The Angel of Darkness gets blamed for a lot of the Tomb Raider franchise&#x27;s failures in the early-to-mid 2000s — whether it&#x27;s the downfall of Core Design, the box office flop of the second Angelina Jolie movie, or the continuity reboot the series needed before anyone would agree to publish another one of its games. While I have to admit there&#x27;s some pretty damning circumstantial evidence there and that not every accusation is exactly unfounded, the game&#x27;s memetic unpopularity even among people who never played it still feels harsher than is warranted.

                              <span>Horror games are great and all that, but what about games that make you the monster? Yeah. Chew on that for a second.

I&#x27;m not just talking about games that belong to the horror genre, either. In fact, spare those asymmetrical multiplayer games that are all the rage with their worryingly young audiences, there are few actual horror games that let you assume the role of the villain. But that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a deluge of titles where you play as a creature so vile, so menacing, that the residents of their worlds undoubtly view the player as evil incarnate. Far from it. The games on this list may not all be spooky in tone, but your character is still the stuff of actual nightmares.

As reported by Tech News Space, it appears that Robert Kurvitz, the lead developer and writer on Disco Elysium, is suing Studio ZA/UM, the development studio of Disco Elysium, via his own company Telomer. Kotaku AU seem to have corroborated this, finding a record on the Estonian Ministry of Justice&#x27;s website showing Telomer has filed an application against ZA/UM Studio to &quot;obtain information and review documents&quot;, which you can see for yourself here.
This comes after Martin Luiga announced (in a frankly kinda weird post) the dissolution of The ZA/UM Cultural Association, and that Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov were no longer working at Studio ZA/UM.

                              <span>House Castle has been on a bit of a horror binge this month, what with it being Spooky Season and all. Not because we&#x27;re die-hard horror buffs - if anything, we&#x27;re both lifelong wimps when it comes to this stuff. But buoyed by a growing resolve to tackle our collective cowardice head on, October has seen us watch, play and read several of the big horror classics we&#x27;ve been too chicken to attempt in the past. Over the course of it all, though, there&#x27;s been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I&#x27;ve often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.
I was beginning to think I&#x27;d lost the capacity to feel anything at all. Heck, the real horror show this month has been the collapse of the entire UK nation state, and yet I still cannot bring myself to muster anything beyond a tired sigh. Then I got to the second act of Resident Evil Village&#x27;s Shadows Of Rose DLC and, oh yes, hello fear. It&#x27;s been a while, hasn&#x27;t it?

                              <span>Silent Hill: Townfall’s announcement was decidedly cryptic, but fans have since found various secrets hiding in the trailer. Announced during Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission broadcast last week, Silent Hill: Townfall is being developed by No Code, the studio behind the spooky Observation. The trailer was light on details, with a speech about crime and judgement playing over footage from a Pocket Television, but some eagle-eyed - or perhaps eared - fans have uncovered messages hidden in the audio that might give us a hint of what Townfall is all about.

                              <span>PlatinumGames embodies style, imagination, and risk-taking. Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.
Launching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.
Nintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.

Former Bayonetta 3 voice actor Hellena Taylor has released a new thread of tweets clarifying some of what she said in regards to Platinum Games&#x27; &quot;immoral&quot; compensation offer to return to voice the titular character in the threequel. These tweets follow a report from Bloomberg that refuted Taylor&#x27;s original claims and added clarification from sources as to how Jennifer Hale, the new Bayonetta voice actor, came about getting the role. They also follow a statement released by Platinum Games that essentially asks the community to support Hale and her statement. 
In Taylor&#x27;s thread, released October 24, the voice actor says that she feels &quot;the need to defend myself and my reputation in the industry&quot; since &quot;some people are calling me a liar and a golddigger.&quot;

                              <span>The Cooler Master NR200P is one of the best small form factor PC cases on the market, but it normally costs around £100 - a fair amount of money. Today though, you can pick up the case for nearly half off, as CCL are selling this model for just £54.
For context, the last time we wrote about a big discount to this model, it was down to £76 - so this is the best deal we&#x27;ve ever seen on the NR200P by some margin!

Currently there are accelerator drivers living within the catch-all &quot;char/misc&quot; area of the kernel while some driver efforts have been focused on Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem integration given the commonality with GPUs and some of the core infrastructure and APIs being relevant for both GPUs and these dedicated accelerator ASICs. There finally seems to be some agreement over the future of the accelerator subsystem and some initial patches were mailed out this weekend...</span>

The IFS driver and associated hardware capability is for detecting potential problems not caught by parity or ECC checks on systems in production. In-Field Scan was merged in Linux 5.19 but then shortly thereafter the driver was marked &quot;broken&quot; due to some driver design issues coming to light. New patches for IFS have been posted to improve the driver&#x27;s design and remove that &quot;broken&quot; tag...</span>

Pairing asymmetrical multiplayer experts IllFonic with the Ghostbusters license is a match made in the spirit realm. Previous outings Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds pit Jason and Predator against camp counselors and mercenaries with flashes of greatness, but technical issues and uneven design choices held them back. With Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, the team has applied everything it’s learned about compelling asymmetrical multiplayer to a property that perfectly lines up with the game…</span>

                              <span>Standing here, I realize that this Super Replay will be a cut above the rest because we’ll be slicing and dicing in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance! Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. 
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. 


Join me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Going into my hands-on time with Pokémon Scarlet, I was expecting some changes based on the ninth generation’s embrace of open-world gameplay and a “do what you want when you want” mentality with its three primary story paths. Pokémon has yet to take the massive generational shift I’ve dreamed of for years and has instead opted for half-steps with each new entry. Scarlet isn’t the transformation I hoped for, but it’s significantly more than a simple half-step, representing arguably the most considerable shift in mainline Pokémon history.

                              <span>Capcom held a special Resident Evil showcase yesterday, revealing more about the upcoming Resident Evil Village Gold Edition, that game&#x27;s Shadows of Rose DLC, and its remake of Resident Evil 4. 
Capcom revealed that it was remaking the beloved classic earlier this year, giving it a March 24, 2023 release date. Now, the company has released a second trailer for Resident Evil 4 and simply put, this game looks stunning. It wasn&#x27;t a surprise when Capcom revealed it was remaking Resident Evil 4 – it was next in line after all – but given how well-regarded the original is, plenty of people were skeptical this remake would live up to its legacy. Capcom is deadset on proving skeptics wrong if yesterday&#x27;s trailer is any indication.

                              <span>This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake&#x27;s Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don&#x27;t steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.
This puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven&#x27;t played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you&#x27;re missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, &quot;Yes&quot;. The long answer is, &quot;Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably&quot;.

It&#x27;s about starting a job in a museum and archive based around a former tobacco plantation, and run by the extremely wealthy descendants of its owners. It&#x27;s not about what great people they were. It didn&#x27;t feel like trauma porn, but obviously I can only speak as a ludicrously white person from another country.
What it is definitely good at it is representing real historical research, and who gets to write the history that suits them.

                              <span>Anyone who’s played the charming Tunic knows that it’s a little cryptic. There’s an immediately nonsensical language to try and decipher, for one thing. Then you’ve got an in-game manual that’s been pulled apart, with pages strewn around the world to find before you can figure out how to do everything your little fox is capable of. Well, now audio designer Kevin Regamey has explained a whole other secret side to Tunic, and it turns out the game’s soundtrack hides a whole other language.

                              <span>As Ed detailed in his review earlier this week, Gotham Knights is a bit of a disappointing dud. I&#x27;ve also been picking my way through Gotham City as various members of the bat family, weightlessly punching dudes in alleys before crafting new sticks that hit 2% harder than the one I was using before. Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. 


It didn&#x27;t help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady&#x27;s trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.

The early access version of the game will allow you to fully travel around the Kerbolar system - can’t quite believe I typed that - which has been given a major overhaul since the first game. There’ll also be more than 350 new parts to build your spacecraft with. You can watch a lengthy chat with the Kerbal team about their early access mission below.

Valve&#x27;s cooperative FPS is still a great hangout game after 13 years but while waiting for my pal to log on, I did think I might refresh it by browsing the Steam Workshop and installing some popular mods. Turns out, modders have made lots of anime girls and VTuber avatars to replace friends, enemies, and even guns. What an experience! It is startling to discover that the blue-haired anime approaching you is not a teammate but, in fact, a vomit-filled Boomer.

That’s why I raised an intrigued eyebrow while sipping my seventeenth cup of tea today, after I saw Twitch streamer Luality playing FromSoftware’s latest with just a drawing tablet. Taking on the challenge with admirable confidence, Luality used a virtual keyboard on the tablet’s left side for movement, and bound strokes of the stylus to attack its enormous monsters.

It&#x27;s an uphill fort siege where you&#x27;re facing off against an evil necromancer who&#x27;s shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone&#x27;s mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you&#x27;ve just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. 
Tactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it&#x27;s clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you&#x27;d learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I&#x27;m still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn&#x27;s opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.

                              <span>Frosty survival game The Long Dark is releasing the first part of its paid expansion, Tales From The Far Territory, in December. The expansion is part of devs Hinterland Studio’s efforts to make further improvements to the game’s Survival Mode, and will be split into multiple releases over twelve months. I’m getting a Stranger Things season four vibe from what’s been shown so far. You can see for yourself by watching the short, and quite dark, teaser trailer below.

                              <span>About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.


I was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle proved naysayers wrong by offering a well-crafted tactics game that successfully blends two very disparate franchises. Its sequel, Sparks of Hope, now must live up to fan excitement rather than dispel their doubt. Ubisoft Milan accomplishes this feat by returning to the drawing board, reworking its template, and creating a more streamlined, dynamic experience that maintains strategic depth. The core combat remains strong, but Ubisoft fleshed out the rest of the offerings to create a more wholly engaging packa…</span>

                              <span>Square Enix and developer Creative Business Unit III have released a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI called “Ambition,” and it features plenty of details about the realm of Valisthea, its multiple kingdoms, Eikons, and much more. 
Since its reveal in 2020, Square Enix has been slowly doling out information about this hotly-anticipated RPG. With beloved Final Fantasy XIV director and producer Naoki Yoshida in the producer seat for this title, many are excited to see what a single-player mainline Final Fantasy looks like from him and his team. A few trailers have been released, further detailing this medieval fantasy adventure, and now, Square Enix has released a new four-and-a-half-minute video to showcase even more of what to expect.

One of my biggest gripes with the mainline Borderlands series is its humor. I’ve had some good laughs while playing, but Borderlands’ jokes land more like a shotgun blast where some hit and others don’t. That’s okay in bursts, but shotgun blast after shotgun blast can get exhausting. Telltale Games’ take on this universe, Tales From The Borderlands, remedied this by providing a more nuanced and subtle take on the humor coursing through the franchise’s veins. It became one of my favorite Borderlands games, with a gr…</span>

                              <span>Street Fighter 6&#x27;s beta ran from October 7th until the 10th - or at least it was meant to. Some cheeky players found a way to keep playing the beta after it ended, prompting Capcom to release a new update earlier today to delete it from player&#x27;s hard drives.

As per usual, pre-ordering the latest iteration of the long-running management sim gives you access to the beta, which is nearly-final version of the full game. It&#x27;s 20% cheaper than the full game will be when it releases on November 8th, and it&#x27;s available from Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Now, dear reader, I return once again with a free browser-based game that&#x27;s perfect for long-distance fun. But this time, it&#x27;s just about the funniest game I can remember playing. It&#x27;s called Gartic Phone.

                              <span>Square Enix have released a new cinematic (with a teeny sliver of gameplay) trailer for Final Fantasy 16 today, and crikey, there&#x27;s a heck of a lot of summons action in there. Technically, the summons are called Eikons in this version of Squeenix&#x27;s long-running JRPG series, and from the looks of the trailer, you&#x27;ll be battling as them directly in big, dramatic battle sequences. A bit like in Final Fantasy X, just with an infinitely higher number of enormous explosions. Let&#x27;s take a look, shall we?

If we don’t own them already, that is. There’s a strong chance that you might have already picked up either or both of this week’s freebies. One is Bethesda’s first instalment of their take on the retro-futuristic post-apocalypse in Fallout 3. There’s also Shiro Games’ ode to classic console RPGs, the Evoland series.

                              <span>As a James who’s always forgetting things, I’m probably the main target audience of the Silent Hill 2 remake – one of yesterday’s many Silent Hill game and film announcements. Nevertheless, I wouldn’t have expected such high demands from its PC system requirements, which have appeared on Steam.


Highlights include the AMD Radeon RX 5700 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 – a former flagship! – listed among the minimum specs, alongside a 12GB RAM requirement, and Windows 11 as the recommended OS. Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.

In an update on the Overwatch forums, Blizzard confirmed that the missing characters should be returning to the game on October 25th, alongside the Junkertown map, which has also recently been disabled due to graphical performance bugs. Their return coincides with the game’s next planned update.

There are chips in this family with many more cores and even higher clock speeds, like the £700 Core i9-13900K, but this is the one most upgrade-seekers will probably look to first: a mid-range champion to take over from the Core i5-12600K.

                              <span>Valve have updated their Steamworks documentation for developers with a commitment to refresh their suggestions for regional pricing more often. This change in frequency is an effort to reflect global and local economic conditions affecting regions. While the company reminds developers that they are free to set their own prices in different regions, Steam provides regional pricing suggestions based on the price of a game in US dollars. Those recommendations should be updated more regularly, Valve said.

                              <span>I watched a badminton match where one player was so dominant, his opponent looked like he&#x27;d largely given up. The commentator said, &quot;Yep, the belief has all but vanished&quot;, as it panned over a guy who simply wanted to be anywhere but that court. At the time, I&#x27;d already sunk some hours into Gotham Knights and taken a quick break from the action to keep tabs on a tournament and collect my thoughts. But as I turned away from the telly to dive back in for another session, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that if the same commentator had been in the room with me too, they would&#x27;ve repeated themselves. I&#x27;d simply had enough.

                              <span>In every story where a wish is granted - whether by some primary-coloured goon sticking out a lamp, a creepy piece of fairground entertainment, or a piece of cursed bushmeat - there&#x27;s always an ironical sting in the tale. You wish for health and it turns out you can&#x27;t die. You wish for a personal chef, but it turns out he only does offal. You wish everything you touch to turn to gold, then it&#x27;ll turn out there&#x27;s no way to turn it off - or it kicks in just as you go to the toilet, that kind of thing. You should, as the saying goes, be careful what you wish for.
I&#x27;m sorry I wished for New Tales From the Borderlands, everyone.

                              <span>As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We&#x27;re all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It&#x27;s very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...

                              <span>Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I&#x27;m not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I&#x27;m sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We&#x27;re still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I&#x27;d imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I&#x27;ll keep you posted as soon as we&#x27;ve got more to share on it.
Things that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year&#x27;s list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won&#x27;t want to miss it.

                              <span>The piracy liability trial between several major record labels and ISP Grande Communications is underway. When the parties presented their opening statements, Grande informed the jury that it will present a witness who has spoken to multiple innocent infringers. That came as a surprise to the labels and prompted a request for the court to exclude &#x27;hearsay&#x27; evidence from the jury.

                              <span>Released seven years ago, Warhammer 40,000: Regicide offers a kind of far future murder-chess. Although really that should be &quot;offered&quot;. Earlier today, Regicide&#x27;s developers announced on Steam that the game had been taken off sale and its servers closed down. In the brief announcement, developers Hammerfall Publishing say only that they &quot;will be venturing into new and exciting projects in the future.&quot;

                              <span>The Crysis Remastered Trilogy is heading to Steam next month, a little over a year after it first launched via the Epic Games Store. The pack does what you&#x27;d expect it to: takes Crytek&#x27;s three scifi shooters and spruces them up with modern rendering trickery.

If it isn’t, it’s not too hard to pretend, and DRG’s another-day-at-the-office wit lends it a likeable levity that’s partly why I’ve played it almost every week for a year and a half.

                              <span>The last time we saw Amicia and Hugo de Rune in A Plague Tale: Innocence, the two homeless orphans were escaping the clutches of the Inquisition, trying desperately to find a cure for the cursed Prima Macula in Hugo’s blood. They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?
Turns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they&#x27;ll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.

Earlier this week, the publisher announced there would be a Silent Hill Transmission stream taking place today, October 19th, which would provide &quot;the latest updates&quot; on the series. At the time, there were no streaming links available, but in setting their YouTube page live this morning, Konami jumped the gun and included some of the game names being revealed. And it&#x27;s the big one, folks. Spoilers within, obvs.

                              <span>After what feels like an eternity of rumors, leaks, and speculation regarding the future of Silent Hill, Konami is finally revealing what’s next for the long-dormant franchise. The publisher is airing a special presentation that promises new Silent Hill reveals today at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. Could it be the much-rumored Silent Hill 2 remake by Bloober Team? Confirmation of the seemingly leaked Silent Hill: The Short Message? Whatever it winds up being, come and watch the event along with us!
Editors Marcus Stewart and the freshly returned Kyle Hilliard will be streaming and reacting to the Silent Hill transmission on Twitch beginning about 10-15 mins before the festivities begin (roughly 3:30 p.m. Central/4:30 p.m Eastern). Come hang with them along with the rest of the GI community and share excitement (or disappointment) at what Konami has in store. Missed the stream? Watch the YouTube version below!

                              <span>It&#x27;s the middle of the month, which means it&#x27;s time for another batch of Game Pass games to be detailed. For a start, today sees the day one release of A Plague Tale: Requiem, the followup to everyone&#x27;s favourite Middle Ages ratventure. There are similarly big games to come before the end of the month, however, including Persona 5 Royal.

                              <span>I used to think Ghostbusters was a fantasy about having a cool car and a slidey pole in your house. Now that I&#x27;m an adult I realise it&#x27;s actually a fantasy about having ample free time to hang out with your friends in New York. But I suppose it&#x27;s also about bustin&#x27; ghosts, which is what Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed&#x27;s asymmetric multiplayer replicates. It&#x27;s out today.

That&#x27;s because, during today&#x27;s Sims Summit livestream, Maxis also announced that the next The Sims is in-development. Currently codenamed Project Rene, it&#x27;s a few years away, although we saw some early footage of its creative tools in action.

                              <span>Robot damage hero Bastion has been unplayable in Overwatch 2 for the past week due to some unfortunate shenanigans with his artillery ultimate. It was only meant to be temporary, Blizzard said. Yet this increasingly lengthy absence from the game&#x27;s resulted in some players treating the poor droid as though he&#x27;d passed away rather than becoming glitched out for a little while.

                              <span>My initial instinct when playing Payday 2 was to be sneaky. If I could creep through banks, jewellery stores, and all the rest without being detected, surely that’d be awesome. Only, the pursuit of that was anything but awesome. It was a gruelling slog of planning and restarts with rarely a sliver of success. So, I chucked my silencer away and donned the biggest suit of armour I could find. Unsurprisingly, the biggest joy in Payday 2 is going loud, and it turns out I’m a big fan of playing stealth games that allow you to skip stealth entirely.

Hailing from some of the devs behind Blizzard’s successful digital CCG Hearthstone, Marvel Snap takes the House Of Ideas’ superheroic formula and runs with the current multiversal obsession of the MCU. The game also mixes in the art and variants you’d expect from Marvel’s comic book output.

                              <span>The PC continues to collect PlayStation mascots like they’re Maccies Monopoly tickets. This time it’s adventuring iron-quiffed quipper Nathan Drake, courtesy of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, which is out on Steam on November 19th. And where there’s a Steam game, there’s usually a Steam Deck game, so Liam and I have both busted out the handhelds to see how well this remastered bundle of Uncharted: A Thief’s End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy takes to more portable hardware. That includes the best settings to use if you want to play it on your own Steam Deck.
You can watch Liam’s video below to see how he got on, along with footage of how Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection runs in situ. After swapping notes we’ve settled on a settings guide that will get you consistently decent performance across both the individual games; if you’d prefer it in text form, read on.

                              <span>Guildford in the UK isn’t a place that you’d expect to feature in games. It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it&#x27;s because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.

                              <span>I loved Overwatch when it first came out. When the original game was fresh and new, I was experimenting with the characters just like everyone else. I found my niche in support, and got to be a pretty decent player with Mercy and Lúcio (I was particularly proud of the latter, because I flatter myself that he&#x27;s quite difficult to play well). Then, you know, life happened. I didn&#x27;t have as much time to play, and I just kind of stopped playing Overwatch.
I appear to have nodded off or something, because there are now 35 heroes on the roster, and Overwatch 2 is out. What. Who allowed this? I wish to speak to someone in charge. Jeff? Jeff From The Overwatch Team? Are you there? Jeff is still in charge right? Wait, wh-

                              <span>A few more classics have made their way onto EA’s list of games they’re shutting down online services for, with Mirror’s Edge the most notable casualty for PC players. The shutdown will come into effect from January 19th, 2023, just overshooting the 13th anniversary of the game’s launch on PC. It’ll presumably affect the dystopian parkour game’s online leaderboards, and downloadable Ghosts of other players.

I first reported on this free pumpkin carving game from Adamgryu (of A Short Hike fame) way back in 2020, when it was only the 999th festival, and Alice0 took a stroll around it last year, too.
This year the pumpkins are back, and better than ever. Download the Pumpkin Fest for pay-what-you-can on Itch, carve your very own pump with the tools provided, and place it among the efforts of others in a peaceful spooky scene. You can take a walk around and vote for your favourite pumps. But this isn&#x27;t the only pumpkin game to enjoy! I&#x27;ve found a couple of others, too. It&#x27;s the reason for the spooky season.

Good job that Capcom have announced they’re streaming a Resident Evil showcase this Thursday, October 20th, then. They’ve even roped in Resident Evil Village’s Merchant to narrate the trailer for it. Watch below for a quick look at what’s coming up in the showcase stream.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”
This is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.
October 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we&#x27;d have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:

                              <span>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge controller in August, and now, it has revealed that it will be released this January for $199.99. 
When it was first announced, PlayStation didn&#x27;t reveal too much about its take on the Xbox Elite Series controller type, but it was clear that it was a &quot;pro&quot; version of the DualSense controller, aimed at PS5 enthusiasts. Now, the company has detailed more of what to expect in a new trailer you can check out below: 


The controller will be available to preorder from select retailers starting next week, on October 25. It will be released on January 26, which is the same day the &quot;replaceable stick modules&quot; will be available too. Those will cost $19.99. 
&quot;The DualSense Edge wireless controller features a host of hardware and software-based personalization options, including button remapping, the ability to fine-tune stick sensitivity and triggers, options to swap between multiple control profiles, and a unique on-controller user interface,&quot; a PlayStation Blog post reads. &quot;It also sports the signature comfort and immersive features of the DualSense wireless controller, like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
&quot;You can make the DualSense Edge wireless controller uniquely yours with the included three changeable set of stick caps and two changeable sets of back buttons. Everything will come bundled in the included carrying case, and you can even charge the controller via USB connection while it&#x27;s stored in the case to make sure you&#x27;re always ready for your next play session.&quot; 
PlayStation has included a breakdown of everything you get alongside the carrying case too: 
DualSense Edge wireless controller
USB braided cable
2 Standard caps
2 High dome caps
2 Low dome caps
2 Half dome back buttons
2 Lever back buttons
Connector housing
Carrying case

                              <span>Fortnitemares, the annual Halloween-inspired event in Fortnite, is now live and it brings werewolves, Evil Dead&#x27;s Ash Williams, and Rick &amp; Morty&#x27;s Summer Smith (Morty&#x27;s sister) and Mr. Meeseeks to the game. 
Epic Games announced the event with a quick gameplay trailer teasing what to expect alongside a look at how being a werewolf works in Fortnite. Plus, you can get a quick glimpse of Ash using his infamous chainsaw (it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s attached at this point), likely alluding to the fact that this chainsaw might be a weapon pickup around the battle island, akin to the recent Kamehameha or E-11 Blaster Rifle mythic weapons in recent weeks.

An MPA investigation to identify the site&#x27;s operator was met with sophisticated countermeasures. It ended at a UK property that has been publicly linked to other crimes worth billions of dollars. And a site called KickassTorrents.

Going into A Plague Tale: Requiem, developer Asobo Studio’s follow-up to 2019’s A Plague Tale: Innocence, I was prepared for the usual jump in quality and scale that most sequels embrace. I underestimated just how significant that leap would be, though. Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic. It feels Odyssean in scope and storytelling prowess. Although much of it came together for me by the end of my 20-plus hour journey through medieval France, the game feels stra…</span>

                              <span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope doesn’t release until Thursday, October 20, but the review embargo lifts today. However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet. In the meantime, however, here are some impressions based on roughly the first half of the game.
As a fan of Kingdom Battle, I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played of Sparks of Hope. It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It&#x27;s interesting because this doesn&#x27;t change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game. Heroes still have limited ranges and can’t move after attac…</span>

Silent Hill’s future has been the subject of numerous rumors over the last couple of years, and it appears we’re finally getting a clear answer on what’s next. Konami is broadcasting a Silent Hill Transmission this week.
The event airs Wednesday, October 19 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern. A tweet only states the presentation will feature “the latest updates for the Silent Hill series.&quot; The tweet links to a new Silent Hill website, but it currently doesn&#x27;t offer any more information. 
In your restless dreams, do you see that town?
#SILENTHILL Transmission on Wednesday, October 19th, at 2:00 PM. PDThttps://t.co/8Knoq9xYsa
October 16, 2022
Konami reportedly has multiple Silent Hill projects in development at various studios, a rumor recently corroborated by Silent Hill movie director Christopher Gans. The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. 
The last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014&#x27;s P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima&#x27;s canceled Silent Hills. 
For years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements. What do you expect to see at the Silent Hill Transmission? Let us know in the comments!</span>

                              <span>Your host Wesley LeBlanc discusses Persona 5 Royal, the hugely successful Atlus-developed RPG originally released in 2019 as a new version of the original 2016 Persona 5. After years of hopeful waiting, Persona 5 Royal has finally made its way to Switch, and we&#x27;ve been playing it. 
In today&#x27;s installment of New Gameplay Today, your host talks about the lasting legacy of Persona 5 Royal, what makes the game so special, and how it looks and feels on Switch. Enjoy nearly 15 minutes of Persona 5 Royal from the game&#x27;s opening moments (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about spoilers too much if you haven&#x27;t played the game elsewhere!). 


Personal 5 Royal hits Switch on October 21, which is the same day the game hits Xbox and PlayStation consoles and PC too. You can check out our thoughts on the game on PlayStation 4 in Game Informer&#x27;s Persona 5 Royal review.

                              <span>To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. 
The video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. 


Dead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</span>

Also, Wesley explains why he isn&#x27;t enjoying Scorn, the slippery and wet puzzle game we all thought was a first-person shooter. Lastly, Jill talks about her new indie game website, The Indie Informer, and shares what she&#x27;s been up to since departing Game Informer earlier this year.

                              <span>In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.


In Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don&#x27;t feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called &quot;Electromorphosis,&quot; which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.
Say hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!

                              <span>Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.
Developer Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).
Resurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. 
We played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.</span>

                              <span>Your hosts Wesley Leblanc is joined by Game Informer editor Marcus Stewart to discuss Scorn, the new puzzle horror game from developer Ebb Software and publisher Kepler Interactive. The two discuss the game&#x27;s narrative, or lack thereof, how Scorn works as a puzzle game, and ultimately, whether or not it&#x27;s a game the two plan to continue playing. 
If you&#x27;re someone who&#x27;s been following Scorn since its reveal years ago, or someone looking for an interesting Xbox console exclusive, look no further than today&#x27;s New Gameplay Today. Enjoy!


Scorn hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on October 14 (coming to both Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass too!) so if you&#x27;re reading this and are interested in checking the game out for yourself, you can download it today!

The footage shows off the complete time traveling Cereza puzzle we showed in our previous video detailing the game’s new features. We also present a combat challenge room in its entirety, plus as a few stylish skirmishes with the Homunguli in Tokyo’s ravaged city streets.

                              <span>Bayonetta 3’s story has been one of its most speculated elements, and a new trailer shows off over four minutes of cutscenes and fresh gameplay. The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.
In addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect. For Jeanne fans, stay tuned until the end of the video, where we get a surprising look at a gameplay segment starring Bayo&#x27;s BFF.


Bayonetta 3 is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can catch up on our exclusive features and videos at our cover hub by clicking the banner below. The game launches on October 28 for Switch.</span>

                              <span>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is making its way to Steam and The Epic Game Store next month. On November 18, you can swing through Harlem as Miles from the comfort of your PC desktop.
Set one year after the events of Marvel’s Spider-Man, the story follows Miles as he battles the Roxxon corporation and the mysterious Tinkerer. A new trailer shows off the game’s PC features, which are comparable to the first Spider-Man game. Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.


Here are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). 
We scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: 
&quot;For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.&quot;</span>

                              <span>Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game&#x27;s one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. 
Square Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.
Here&#x27;s the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:
The First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. 
Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon&#x27;s Fall, Platinum Games&#x27; live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. 
While The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.</span>

                              <span>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have released a new Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet trailer all about Iono, the electric-type gym leader of Levincia and the most popular streamer in the Paldean region. 
If you&#x27;re expecting a look at Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay or the reveal of some new Pokémon or gameplay mechanics, temper your expectations because this video is all about Iono. Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: 


As you can see, there&#x27;s a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she&#x27;s also a gym leader that we&#x27;ll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it&#x27;s Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her &quot;who&#x27;s that Pokémon?&quot; test.
In this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don&#x27;t get the answer. Perhaps we&#x27;re meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she&#x27;s describing a Pokémon we haven&#x27;t yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait too much longer to meet this &quot;Supercharged Streamer&quot; because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. 
In the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. 
Do you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today&#x27;s trailer? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

                              <span>Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.
The Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. 
“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”
Chmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. 
Witchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. 
Witchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023. You can watch the most recent trailer from this year’s Summer Game Fest here.</span>

                              <span>In the early &#x27;90s, the fighting game genre was a far cry from what it is today. Inspired by series like Final Fight, Kung-Fu Master, and Karate Champ, the fighting genre emerged in arcades, buoyed by a few significant players in the space. One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. 
The Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry. Now, 30 years into the series&#x27; existence, Mortal Kombat has proven it&#x27;s here to stay as one of the preemin…</span>

This punk rock-inspired warrior hails from another universe and is an Umbra Witch in training. She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. 


Instead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.
Playing as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…</span>
