Yet, we have reached a unique moment where the Ultimate Team community is lobbying heavily for Antony to be awarded for February instead of him AND a certain Barca star. When I saw a certain Reddit thread, I thought that it must have been a joke. Twenty-four hours on, I firmly believe that we might be living in a reality where we might be getting a POTM card for Antony.


Antony getting an EA FC 25 LaLiga POTM SBC will be massive

                              <span>Legendary Entertainment&#x27;s live-action Street Fighter movie recently lined up a premiere date, and now it has a director in place. And hey, if The Eric Andre Show&#x27;s Kitao Sakurai can&#x27;t entertain us with his spin on Capcom&#x27;s classic fighter, who can?


Sakurai—known for writing, directing, and producing The Eric Andre Show, as well as directing episodes of Twisted Metal—has been tapped to direct (via The Hollywood Reporter). Legendary is co-producing along with Capcom, and Sony previously set its premiere for March 20, 2026. 


As for what aspects of the Street Fighter series the movie aims to tackle, those details have yet to be divulged. Will Sakurai get a chance to cover more recent hits like Street Fighter 6, or will this be the ultimate redemption arc for a well-aged Guile by way of Jean-Claude Van Damme?


Takin&#x27; it to the streets

The new Street Fighter movie was confirmed back in April 2023. At the time, twin Australian filmmaker duo Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me) were in talks to direct. 


Of course, one would be remiss not to mention the original 1994 live-action Street Fighter as much as possible in any related article. While historically maligned as a failure, the endlessly entertaining work of art starred the aforementioned Van Damme as Guile opposite Raul Julia in a powerful turn as M. Bison. Don&#x27;t listen to anyone who says writer and director Steven E. de Souza&#x27;s feature is anything other than a classic example of pure game-inspired camp. 


There was also 2009&#x27;s fair to middlin&#x27; Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, which starred Kristin Kreuk as Chun-Li and Chris Klein as Charlie Nash. The real Capcom film to beat, however, is 1994&#x27;s Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, a Gisaburo Sugii-directed and Group TAC-animated banger that hit all the right notes. So go ahead, Sakurai, do your best and your worst!

                              <span>One of the more notable visual aspects of Obsidian&#x27;s new game Avowed is its lush landscapes. Much of the Living Lands is replete with forested regions, plant life, and that fungal growth that totally doesn&#x27;t remind me of The last of Us (spoiler: it totally does).


And it&#x27;s this aesthetic that we&#x27;re definitely getting with this custom Xbox Series X that takes its look directly from Avowed. In a recent post on X, Marketing Lead for Xbox, Bailey Kosdal, has showcased a pretty spectacular design of the console, which was put together by artist and designer Vadu Amka (seriously, check out some of their other projects).




Kosdal says the custom Xbox is to celebrate the game being released in the Benelux region, which is the part of Western Europe that incorporates Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg (hence the name). As for whether you&#x27;ll be able to get your hands on this pretty fabulous-looking console, it remains to be seen at this stage, but the post does say to keep an eye on the Dutch channels &quot;for a possible giveaway.&quot;


While we&#x27;re at it, an Avowed-inspired PC as well


It&#x27;s pretty obvious that the most striking thing about this particular Xbox Series X is how it encapsulates the flora of Avowed. And Amka is not the only one who&#x27;s celebrating the game&#x27;s release with a gaming machine that incorporates Eora&#x27;s natural splendor.


In another post by Kosdal, someone else has put together a custom PC that magnificently disguises itself as a series of moss, leaves, and twisted vines. You can check it out here. Behold, for &#x27;tis splendiferous! This one has been designed by computer builder Tim Malmborg from Sweden.


There is evidently something striking about Avowed&#x27;s world that&#x27;s inspired these two to capture that lush essence in hardware form. Hopefully, there&#x27;ll be a chance to win the Xbox at some point, but I suspect this won&#x27;t be the end of consoles and PCs that take cues from Obsidian&#x27;s latest RPG.

Card battlers, for example, are a guilty pleasure, and I&#x27;ve played most of them. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m excited about Monster Train 2, the sequel to one of the best card battlers on the market.


Don&#x27;t get me wrong: there&#x27;s a huge number of excellent card battler games available right now. In fact, the original card battler, Slay the Spire, is about to get a full-featured sequel sometime soon-ish, which is a huge deal in its own right. Yet, the original Monster Train had me hooked from the get-go, and I kept coming back to the game over and over again. The developer Shiny Shoe has announced Monster Train 2 with a snazzy new trailer and an equally snazzy free demo.

                              <span>Bungie&#x27;s had its fair share of lawsuits over the years, though the vast majority of them have had to do with the company pursuing cheaters and hackers. A far more serious case has since sprung up, however, and it concerns the former director Christopher Barret, who was fired over misconduct.


More specifically, Christopher Barret worked on the upcoming Bungie extraction shooter Marathon when he was fired over alleged misconduct. The details of what went down in the background have been rather hazy up until now, and it likely would&#x27;ve stayed that way had Barret not chosen to legally pursue Bungie and Sony over what he claims was a &quot;sham&quot; investigation into his behavior. It would seem that Sony is sick and tired of this entire schtick, however, because the company has effectively responded …</span>

These bundles are usually one-offs, organized by different people in response to natural disasters, mutual aid requests, battles against human rights abuses, and other crises that spring up moment-to-moment. 


Every charity bundle of its kind is important, but rarely will there ever be a follow-up bundle under the same name or working towards the specific goal. In contrast, the Solo But Not Alone bundle has returned for its fifth year, still with the goal of assisting mental health charities.


Cat McDonald of Peach Garden Games has been organizing the Solo But Not Alone bundles since 2021. Each bundle&#x27;s primary appeal, in terms of the games they offer, is a wide variety of new single-player tabletop roleplayi…</span>

                              <span>You know what? It&#x27;s been a hot minute since I spoke about Doom or its equally influential follow-up, Doom 2. Both staples in the FPS genre, I&#x27;m struggling to come to terms with the thought that one day we may stop talking about these classic games.


However, now is not that time, and if you want to experience a veritable smorgasbord of first-person shooting from well-known names, you should definitely check out Doom: Incarnate. This is a mod from user D3athStalker that combines Doom 2 with Wolfenstein, allowing you to fill the boots of the latter&#x27;s legendary protagonist, BJ Blazkowicz.

                              <span>If the latest rumors are to be believed, the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC is going to be added to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team as part of the next campaign.


EA Sports have already confirmed Fantasy FC and most of the new cards will be available in packs. However, some cards like Joao Felix are going to be added via SBCs and objectives, making it easier for all to get them. While EA Sports hasn&#x27;t announced details about the upcoming SBC, here are my predictions about its release date and possible costs.


EA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC release date (Expected)


The Fantasy FC promo begins on Friday, February 21. Typically, EA Sports always schedules a big SBC on the first night of a new promo. If I had to predict, Felix could well be that on SBC, and fans could end up getting the card as early as Friday, February 21.


However, weekends are also possible dates for EA Sports to release big SBCs in Ultimate Team. Hence, February 22 or February 23 could also be possible dates for the challenge to be released in Ultimate Team.


EA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC costs (Predicted)


There have been very few SBCs this year that have been in the middle of the road when it comes to completion costs. I feel that the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC could be priced similarly along with the Ferland Mendy Grassroot Greats SBC. Hence, it&#x27;s best to reserve around 600,000 coins worth of fodder if you want to add Felix to your squad.


If you&#x27;re unwilling to wait, there are some worthy choices to consider from the ongoing Grassroot Greats SBC. N&#x27;Golo Kante is an exceptional defensive midfielder you can add to your squad, who will boss the middle of the field. If you&#x27;re on a shorter budget, the Moise Bombito Grassroot Greats SBC offers excellent value at less than 100,000 coins worth of fodder.

It&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll find most of the dangers the area is famous for, so take care while visiting.


You can start at the Apollonia fast travel location. If you don&#x27;t have it unlocked, you can reach the spot by taking the road east from Troskowitz.

A simple sentiment is often the most effective, and the title of Dragon Age veteran Mark Darrah&#x27;s latest video cuts right to the heart of it: &quot;Your $70 doesn&#x27;t buy you cruelty.&quot;
You don&#x27;t have to like a game, and you don&#x27;t have stay quiet if you have complaints, says Darrah. You&#x27;re entitled to be angry, and you&#x27;re entitled to express that anger. &quot;If you are mad at that Ubisoft game, be mad at Ubisoft,&quot; he says. &quot;Express your anger to Ubisoft or the studio that made the game. But you cross a line when you start being cruel about it.&quot; (Thanks, PC Gamer and GamesRadar)

                              <span>Affordable Lego..? Does. Not. Compute.
Shortly before Nintendo lifted the lid on the upcoming Switch 2, the company announced that it would once again be teaming up with Lego. We&#x27;ve had the NES, we&#x27;ve had Animal Crossing sets, and now we&#x27;re getting the Game Boy.

                              <span>Though numbers are falling across the board.
Over in Japan this week, after Super Mario Party Jamboree briefly managed to claim the top spot last week, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD has once again given its first-party brethren the ol&#x27; one-two to take gold once again.
Selling a further 14,752 copies, Forever Entertainment&#x27;s remaster of Retro Studios&#x27; classic is now just 4,551 sales away from that sweet 200,000 milestone. Pretty good considering its mixed reception, really! Elsewhere, the Switch version of Civilization VII is the only one to crack the top ten, while Urban Myth Dissolution Center makes an admirable debut at number four.

The Pokémon Company has today announced (via Serebii) that a Pokémon Presents showcase will be coming our way on 27th February at 2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 9am ET / 6am PT — wait, that&#x27;s Pokémon Day!
Of course, this will come as a surprise to absolutely no one. TPC always tends to use the anniversary of Red and Green&#x27;s Japanese release to show us what&#x27;s happening in the world of &#x27;mon for the year ahead, and this year is no exception. Pair that predictability with the Pokémon GO datamine from back in January, and yeah, we were pretty sure this one was a dead cert.

                              <span>The long-awaited Magic: The Gathering and FINAL FANTASY collaboration for MTG&#x27;s Universes Beyond series has finally been revealed, and you can now claim as many packs as you want ahead of the set&#x27;s release on June 13.


Yesterday, Wizards Of The Coast revealed how the iconic Final Fantasy summons would work on this collaboration. The company also revealed the cards of some of the most iconic characters in the history of the series. The most hype reveals so far, were those of Cloud and Tidus, who&#x27;ll be part of the commander set.

These are the two main characters in the two most successful Final Fantasy titles so far, meaning Wizards would naturally be big selling points for this new set. Still, the company reminds players that the set features characters from every single one of the 16 mainline Final Fantasy series.


Among the reveals so far, my favorite has to be Jumbo Cactuar, a card whose special ability, &quot;10,000 Needles,&quot; will annihilate anyone who doesn&#x27;t find a way to stop it. What a beautiful way to celebrate one of the most ridiculous special moves ever seen in a game.

You can now preorder some items from the Magic: The Gathering — FINAL FANTASY set. Through Amazon, you can already preorder the Starter Kit, Play Boosters, Play Booster bundles, and commander decks, except the one featuring Cloud.


Bundles, Collector Boosters, and Commander Deck Bundles will likely become available to preorder anytime now. Prerelease packs are available for preorder at your local store.


The Magic: The Gathering — FINAL FANTASY will be released on June 13, except for the Gift Bundle, which comes out on June 27.

                              <span>Horses are usually quite costly in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Although you can get a couple of horses for free during the main storyline, most are available from various vendors around the map. Fortunately, if you&#x27;re a stealthy thief, you can turn an expensive purchase into a potential money-making method.


How to steal horses in KCD2


Stealing horses in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a quick and easy process if you stay hidden from other characters. As you approach a horse, you&#x27;ll find a &quot;mount and steal&quot; option, letting you mount the horse and run away from potential onlookers.

As you explore the lands inside the game, you&#x27;ll come across a variety of materials that can be put to different uses. Some of these items are used as upgrade materials, while there are few which are used for enchantment. All of these items are extremely important for mid and late game, so the onus is on your to find them in the first place. 


All upgrade materials in Avowed and how to find them


A wide variety of upgrade materials can be obtained in different ways. You can always buy most of them from traders, but a few pesky ones will make you look harder in different locations.

                              <span>FC Fantasy is going to be the next promo coming to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team, and it could include some amazing cards for players to obtain.


Fantasy is going to be a returning promo since we had the campaign back in FC 24. So far, EA Sports hasn&#x27;t dropped any hints about which cards will be released during the campaigns. A few leaks have already started making the rounds ahead of the promo&#x27;s official release in Ultimate Team.


All EA FC 25 FC Fantasy promo players (leaks)


If you believe the leaks, the upcoming promo will have special cards for both active footballers and Heroes. The latter represents former footballers who have hung up their playing boots following illustrious careers. Last year, we had the same pattern, so history might be about to repeat itself.



Eden Hazard


Joe Cole


Omar Marmoush


Heung-Min Son


Khvicha Kvaratskhelia


Donyell Malen


Aurelien Tchouameni


Crystal Dunn


Viktor Tsygankov


Moises Caicedo


Philip Billing


Babajide



Of course, the leaks so far are limited in numbers, as more names are expected to appear as we get closer to the release date. Once again, the promo cards might be Dynamic: they will receive boosts and upgrades based on results from real-life football.


EA FC 25 FC Fantasy promo release date


The release date was given away when we received Season 5 of Ultimate Team. Based on the available information, the upcoming promo will be a two-week-long affair, and the first team will be released on Friday, February 21. This will be followed by the second team on February 28, which will add new cards to packs.


Once again, most of the promo items will be available in packs, but expect to find a few great items in the form of objectives and SBCs. Last year, we had some great SBCs like Timo Werner and Fridolina Rolfo. It will be interesting to see what EA Sports has planned for the community as part of the upcoming campaign for Ultimate Team.

The Moogle Treasure Trove is a recurring event in FFXIV that provides players a new way to get their hands on old, sought-after items. By completing objectives and challenges, players can stock up on Irregular Tomestones and then exchange them with the Itinerant Moogle in any of the three major city-states for a selection of goodies.

The next Moogle Treasure Trove event is The Hunt for Phantasmagoria, which will allow players to grab some very worthwhile rewards, including the following stand-out stars (all shown in the image above):

This is the first time that Kirby has received a promo item in Ultimate Team this year. To play with the card, you&#x27;ll have to complete the SBC and all its tasks. Let&#x27;s take a look at how you can unlock the card and add it to your Ultimate Team squad.


EA FC 25 Fran Kirby Grassroot Greats SBC tasks


The Fran Kirby Grassroot Greats SBC has two tasks, and here are their requirements.


Task 1 - England



Min. 1 Players from: England


Min. Team Rating: 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Min. 1 Players: Team of the Week


Min. Team Rating: 85



EA FC 25 Fran Kirby Grassroot The Greats SBC solutions


Here&#x27;s a set of solutions you can use to complete the latest promo challenge in Ultimate Team.


Task 1 - England



Jonsdottir 82


Catarina Macario 84


Vlahovic 84


Dani Olmo 84


Aleix Garcia 84


Mbock 84


Bronze 85


Fabian Ruiz 82


Camavinga 82


Reece James 84


Acerbi 84



Task 2 - Top Form



Patri 88


Caruso 84


Neville 83


Openda 85


Bright 85


Any 85-rated TOTW item


Aleix Garcia 84


Dabritz 84


Pavard 84


Coman 84


Koulibaly 84



While the SBC is pretty well-valued, the card on offer is below the power curve. The only option is to add her to the Grassroot Growth Evolution and improve the card to a 90-rated item. That will also add Tiki Taka+ as a second playstyle, making it a pretty useful bargain item in Ultimate Team.


If you&#x27;re looking for cheaper SBCs with better value, the Athenea Grassroot Greats SBC and Moise Bombito Grassroot Greats SBC are great shouts.

Disney Dreamlight Valley&#x27;s next update release date


The next DDV update, &#x27;&#x27;Tales of Agrabah,&quot; will be released on February 26, 2025. This patch brings the much-anticipated arrival of Jasmine and Aladdin, two iconic characters from Disney&#x27;s Aladdin. We still have yet to find out the exact timing for the update, but it will likely launch around 6 a.m. PT, based on previous debuts.

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve been holding out—and I have to be honest, missing out—on playing developer Wrong Organ&#x27;s psychological-horror title Mouthwashing, well now you have no excuse. Publisher Critical Reflex announced today that Mouthwashing will be heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year.




The unique horror game that uses nostalgic PSX-style visuals to tell the haunting tale of the doomed crew aboard a space freighter called the Tulpar was released on Steam in September 2024 and has sold over 500,000 copies on the platform. According to Critical Reflex, fans interested in a physical edition on the PS5 or Switch will have the opportunity to snag one through Fangamer.


Honestly, Mouthwashing is one of those games that that least you know going into it, the better. If you&#x27;re a fan of psychological horror games that are a bit out there in terms of narrative and setting, you won&#x27;t find a better example. However, if you want to have somewhat of an idea of what to expect, here is the premise:


In Mouthwashing you explore the story of a dying crew aboard a shipwrecked space freighter hauling mouthwash across the expanse of space. You&#x27;ll switch between various crew members in first-person as you explore what caused the shipwreck as well as what has transpired since, all while trying to come up with a gameplan. The ship will only stay powered for a few months, and food will run out well before then. But at least there&#x27;s mouthwash, right? For the most part it&#x27;s a narrative-driven experience, and one well worth experiencing.


The crew of the Tulpar and Mouthwashing crashlands on PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year. Those interested in playing now can do so on PC via Steam.

Where to find Discord quests on PC


PC users can find Discord Quests within the Discover icon (compass symbol) to the left, where all your servers are. Select it, and you should see an option for &#x27;Quests.&#x27; You&#x27;ll be greeted with available missions from various games, including Overwatch 2 and Fortnite.

Some Quests are simple enough to complete, like watching short videos on the app. However, most take you out of Discord and must be completed in-game. It shouldn&#x27;t take too long, though, as a few tasks only require you to play a game for 15 minutes. If your progress…</span>

Next week, on 27th February 2025, Pokémon will be celebrating its 29th birthday. And you know what that means? It&#x27;s time for some Pokémon Presents.
After a relatively &#x27;muted&#x27; 2024, there&#x27;s a lot on people&#x27;s minds. Inverted commas there because, come on, if muted means releasing a brand new mobile game which has taken the world by storm, hundreds of new lines of merch, frequent events, codes, new trading cards (and new scandals), and way more, then even Whismur could be confused.

It&#x27;s not been that long since Nightdive Studios released The Thing: Remastered, but we know many of you were holding off on adding it to your collection in the hope that it would receive a physical release. Well, your wish has been granted!
Launching on 25th June 2025 (the 43rd anniversary of the 1982 John Carpenter movie), the physical release will come in two flavours: standard and deluxe. The latter is priced at $49.99 / €54.99 and comes with a gorgeous steelbook case, a poster, Captain Blake&#x27;s ID card, patches, and a deluxe edition box. The standard costs $34.99 and comes with, well... the game.

We&#x27;ve been lucky enough to go hands-on with the upcoming Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition on Switch, and as part of that, we thought it might be useful to see just how the new release stacks up next to the Wii U original.
In short, the Switch remaster represents a significant step up in overall visual quality. We&#x27;ve got big improvements on character models, lighting, resolution, and even a slightly fancier main menu. We&#x27;d expected a nice little upgrade, but some of the enhancements here are perhaps closer to something like Metroid Prime Remastered than, say, Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 2 HD.

Devolver Digital&#x27;s publishing label Big Fan Games and developer Shiny Shoe have today announced that Monster Train 2 — a sequel to the 2021 deckbuilding roguelike — will be choo-chooing its way onto Switch later this year.
Much like its predecessor, this one will see you building up a deck of cards and using the abilities therein to take on foes in three-floor battles. The sequel boasts heaps of new card types, Clans, enemy factions and more, in a fresh story about teaming up Heaven and Hell to take down the Titans — no pressure then, eh?

The developer of hit coming-of-age indie darlings Oxenfree and Oxenfree II, Night School Studio, has been hit by layoffs.
Game Developer has reported that an &quot;undisclosed number of employees&quot; have been laid off at the Netflix-owned studio. This follows on from the streaming giant closing its internal triple-A studio Team Blue, which was headed up by Halo creative lead Joseph Staten, in October 2024.

The snazzy Pokémon x Crocs collection took our breath away last year, Bull Airs released a range of console-inspired sneakers and even Converse has got involved in the past too. But all of them pale in comparison to what Nike has been cooking up: a pair of Air Max 1s inspired by Donkey Kong Country.
This news comes from footwear site Sneaker News, which reports that the &#x27;Big Head Origins&#x27; design is expected to launch at some point in the Spring/Summer period of this year — though nothing has been confirmed as of yet.

The first of these updates is set to land on PC and console at some point this week, though Digital Eclipse warns that it&#x27;s expected to come to Switch &quot;shortly afterwards&quot;. This one is all about boosting the beat &#x27;em up gameplay, with a new skill point system letting you upgrade your chosen Ranger, &#x27;Morphers&#x27; to modify each run, and a handful of new moves so you can take it to Rita&#x27;s minions in style.

It&#x27;s been absolutely ages since we last set foot on Mira, the planet on which humanity seeks refuge from an alien threat in Xenoblade Chronicles X. It was perhaps only a year or two after the game first released on Wii U, in fact, that we last played it, and our overriding memory (besides the fact that it&#x27;s incredible) is of an experience that needed to be unshackled, at a fundamental level, from hardware that was holding it back.
Now, it&#x27;s not like Xenoblade Chronicles X was a mess or anything like that.

                              <span>Cosmo D&#x27;s unwavering passion for pizza is infectious. It&#x27;s also possible that the pizza I&#x27;ve just made in the demo for Moves Of The Diamond Hand is infectious, though I have invested all my points into the cooking skill, so hopefully not. You should be able to play the demo yourself by the time you read this. It&#x27;s one for Betrayal At Club Low fans, taking the failure-is-fun dice rolling RPG systems from that, spicing them up, and letting you properly explore freely in first person this time. I first-personed my way straight to the nearest pizza shop. It almost literally killed my character, but I have baked a pie, and now I feel like a god.

                              <span>Marvel Rivals is this year&#x27;s current free-to-play PC game success story, attracting many millions of players over its opening weekend and making regular appearances in the Steam Most Played top 10 ever since. It garnered an estimated $136 million in January. So naturally, it&#x27;s time to start laying people off. 


Last night, one of the project&#x27;s game directors, Thaddeus Sasser, revealed that an undisclosed number of US-based NetEase Games employees had been dismissed, including level designers Gary McGee and Jack Burrows. NetEase have now confirmed the news, calling it a move to &quot;optimize development efficiency&quot; and assuring players that they &quot;are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game&quot;. Just not so much the people working on it.

                              <span>This article contains moderate spoilers for the closing events of the Wedding Crashers quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

It’s impossible, I think, to play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 without playing a boozer, even if you’re only boozing in cutscenes. The game’s 15th century world is greased by many splendours of hooch, from the wine used in potion-brewing through the finer vintages at banqueting tables to the viral pondwater they sell in seedier taverns. A lot of the time, the writing views alcohol as a means of teeing up some slapstick debauchery reminiscent of Paul Bettany’s character in A Knight’s Tale. It venerates the spectacle of having a large one, with custom dialogue and voice-acting for protagonist Henry when you woozily explain your antics to guards. But sometimes, perhaps despite itself, it expresses something about the culture of drinking and the unpleasantness of being militantly exhorted to drink.

                              <span>The psychology of people who cheat in competitive games remains deeply mysterious to me, but I&#x27;ll hazard a guess it stems from a love of ruining someone&#x27;s day rather than any real sense of accomplishment. Something I am interested in, however, is the idea of play as transgression.
There is, for example, a subset of people who get very irritated at the concept of speedruns. I suspect this is because, even if we aren&#x27;t consciously engaged with a game&#x27;s story, there&#x27;s an underlying sense of what I&#x27;m going to very clumsily call &#x27;narrative correctness&#x27; that&#x27;s absolutely shattered when, say, Leon Kennedy starts shuffling up stairs at superhuman speeds. Glitches, warps, and other exploits expose the shroud of storytelling conjured by every little piece of a game&#x27;s design, pulling off the mask so the underlying grey box is painfully visible. They call art a liar.
Competitive FPS Cheaters Cheetah initially seems like pure transgression against any sense of fair play or even level design, but the key here is that everyone gets cheats like aimbots, wallhacks, and spinbots. &quot;This creates a unique dynamic,&quot; reads the game&#x27;s Steam page, &quot;where everyone knows everyone else&#x27;s position, leading to intense mind games and thrilling battles&quot;. It sounds like it&#x27;s either going to be a complete disaster or incredibly interesting, probably both.

                              <span>War Rats is sort of trash, but I love it all the same. Oh, you&#x27;re giving me a &#x27;ratvolver&#x27; and letting me build &#x27;turrats&#x27; and there&#x27;s a dramatic close-up of swinging rat balls in the intro montage for each stage? Yeah, go on then. It&#x27;s got the vibes of something made by the guy you knew in secondary school who exclusively drew pictures of cartoon dicks but, like, they were undeniably really good dicks. Absolute cock prodigy, that guy. Pablo Dickasso.
Anyway, I&#x27;m probably making it sound like there&#x27;s a serious dick to rat ratio here but it&#x27;s really just those balls. There are some great rat animations though. It&#x27;s a 2D strategy tug-of-war where you push through stages summoning troops and building structures, and when you do, you&#x27;re treated to a bunch of rats with hammers piling up construction barriers. When enemy rats fall, either to your own guns or your army of Ratineeers, gangs of regular-sized rats come to nibble on their corpses. They also say things like &quot;Tell my wife…squeak&quot;.
Also I am 95% sure your Ratvolver fires legally distinct warpstone. They saw me coming, I tell you.

With thousands of innocent website owners and internet users suffering as collateral damage, a new LaLiga announcement reveals that two additional pirate IPTV providers with 400,000 local users have also been blocked, again by blocking Cloudflare. Charts and graphs produced by internet users leave little to the imagination.

They&#x27;re fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it&#x27;s a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.
Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4&#x27;s Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it&#x27;s more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.

Now, here we are with Earth Vs Mars, a boldly-coloured B-movie homage to Advance Wars in which you can splice units with animals to create tactical monstrosities such as &quot;Squirrel-Cows&quot; and &quot;Cheetah-Flies&quot;. Advance Wars aside, the new game harkens back to Relic&#x27;s 2003 RTS oddity Impossible Creatures. The trailer below doesn&#x27;t contain any Chihuahua Whales, but it&#x27;s hopefully just a matter of time.

                              <span>I was completely hooked the first time I played Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The stealth mechanics, brutal survival elements, and insane Cold War espionage plot felt like no other game at the time. I still remember crawling through the jungle with my camo set, hoping to avoid an enemy patrol only to get spotted by a guard and have the entire area on high alert.

                              <span>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii made me smile a lot, but I think the folks at RGG need to take a break for a few years. Watch some films. Have some cocktails. Get inspired again, y&#x27;know? Just as the high seas are the refuge of displaced Yakuza or insolvent scoundrels in this minigame-stuffed brawler-RPG, the game feels like the last port of call for a studio scraping the bottom of the grog barrel.
I smiled a lot, mind. It&#x27;s hard not to with Majima back; moisturised, flourishing, driving a six-inch tanto knife into a man&#x27;s kidneys for being mildly rude to him on the beach, and abducting monkeys for his petting zoo. He&#x27;s also the captain of a pirate ship now, having woken on a strange island with no memory of his Yakuza past, but the same sense of fair play and manic flair for theatrical shankings. Plus, he&#x27;s already got the eyepatch sorted.
Why are there actual, cannon-wielding, tricorn-headed pirates off the coast of Hawaii? Shhh. Just get on the boat. You do find the idea of a Majima being a pirate entertaining enough on its own to last you twenty five hours, don&#x27;t you? I hope so, because this shorter side entry in the series isn&#x27;t so much lean as it is thin.

                              <span>I really, really like Is This Seat Taken? It might just be that this logic puzzler sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it&#x27;s also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.
You&#x27;ve got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it&#x27;s your job to make them all happy. &quot;I want to sit with Bob&quot;. &quot;I need a window seat&quot;. &quot;I forgot to shower&quot;. &quot;I do not like bad smells&quot;. So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you&#x27;ll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It&#x27;s all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.

                              <span>Rockstar Games are considering letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map by way of Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics, according to a report. The idea is that people can make and sell their own “custom experiences”, as they do in those games - expanding upon the existing customisation opportunities in GTA Online. This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in GTA 5.

                              <span>During a recent house clearout I discovered a cache of creative writing from my teenage years. Naturally, I now consider most of it to be unbearable. Reading certain notebooks makes me feel as though my stomach is mounting an upwards assault on my brain. BURN IT, scream the parts of said brain that have learned the perils of starting poems with &quot;O Muse&quot;. BURN IT ALL. Nonetheless, I felt bad about being mean towards my adolescent self, so I popped all those misbegotten papers in a giant suitcase. It squats next to me right now as I type these words, like a mausoleum filled with dead albatrosses. 


Similarly mixed emotions appear to inform Amphora Hell, in which you play an amphora (read: ancient species of vase) with legs. The amphora is the work of the Kilnmaster, a terrible Olympian force who is one part Hephaestus to one part shmup villain. The Kilnmaster has just decided that he hates his amphora with legs and wishes to destroy it with flying hammers. &quot;No evidence of my failure must remain,&quot; he bellows in the Itch preamble. &quot;Prepare to be scrapped!&quot;

                              <span>I tend to play Total War: Warhammer 3 closer to an RPG than a strategy game. Balance? Leave me alone, for I am immersed in the stinky fantasy of being a sniveling Skaven bin-licker, commanding my slaves to mine useless gold purely because it irritates my dwarfish enemies.
As such, I&#x27;m not quite as tuned into the nuances of enemy faction behaviour as a lot of players, despite my ungodly hour count. I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too. A new blog post outlines the changes they&#x27;re making to AI, and there&#x27;s an experimental beta branch available right now if you want to test them out.

                              <span>Most writing tries to avoid cliché, understanding that an overused idea is one that has lost its power. It often feels as if video games take the opposite approach, gleefully piling tropes high upon their back like Labyrinth&#x27;s junk lady. Sure, they sacrifice the opportunity to say anything affecting or which feels true, but presumably the theory is that reminding you of a dozen other films, TV shows, books and games you like is just as good.

Enter Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, hunched over from the weight of all the teen TV shows and young adult novels stacked atop its shoulders.

                              <span>The Hanoi People&#x27;s Procuracy in Vietnam has issued an indictment against two men said to be the operators of the massive Fmovies piracy empire shut down last year. The indictment offers detail on when the men first met, when their plans for Fmovies began to take shape, and how the site generated revenue. Last year the MPA described the shutdown as a &quot;stunning victory.&quot; New revelations are indeed stunning, but extremely puzzling too.

                              <span>Sometimes to chill out I watch timelapse videos of ocean creatures such as starfish colonising patches of sea floor. Perhaps they&#x27;re gracefully devouring a seal&#x27;s carcass, or moving to escape a lethal descending finger of ice. Look, I&#x27;m quite a morbid guy, but &#x27;beauty of nature&#x27; and all that.


It turns out there&#x27;s an equivalent in Warhorse&#x27;s recent RPG-palooza Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2: drop dozens of items in a random town square, and passing NPCs will gradually gather them all up according to preferences dictated by class. Here&#x27;s a video showing that in action, created by Redditor Mcloganator, with three thousand groschen worth of goods to harvest.

                              <span>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer would like to know if video games journalism is OK. He is concerned that the &quot;whole space is gonna go away or be corrupted by things&quot;. He mourns the heyday of magazines, and is bemused by this &quot;SEO&quot; malarkey he keeps hearing about. Much like a Dickensian child holding out a bowl for more gruel, he wants to know if there&#x27;s still a &quot;path&quot; for &quot;people with a real honest voice&quot;.

                              <span>Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda&#x27;s winningly dorky The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin&#x27; Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled &quot;Admire&quot;, &quot;Joke&quot;, &quot;Coerce&quot; and &quot;Boast&quot;, each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC&#x27;s gurnishly changing expression. 
You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying &quot;pie&quot; rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they&#x27;ll affect the NPC&#x27;s opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda&#x27;s ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.

                              <span>I generally avoid using the word &#x27;darling&#x27; as an adjective because it makes you sound like an bourgeois playwright two bottles of sherry deep into a nervous breakdown. Lord Of The Rings tainted the word &#x27;precious&#x27; forever, and the term &#x27;wholesome&#x27; has been Cronenberged to hideous effect. &#x27;Cute&#x27; is too pat, I use &#x27;adorable&#x27; too much, and you cannot make me say &#x27;Kawaii&#x27; under any circumstances.
All that said, management sim Mudborne makes my eyes go wide and my heart swell like a marshmallow dropped in a pond full of excellent frogs. It&#x27;s releasing March 20th on World Frog Day, and a portion of the profits will go to amphibian, wetland, and environmental charities. Have a Steam demo. God I love that soundtrack.

                              <span>A team of Diablo speedrunners spent months searching the 1996 RPG&#x27;s 2.2 billion valid randomly generated dungeon seeds to find the layout used in a stupidly lucky speedrun they suspected to be illegitimate, says a new report from Ars Technica&#x27;s Kyle Orland.
The three minute, 12 second sorcerer run by Maciej &quot;Groobo&quot; Maselewski was first uploaded to Speed Demos Archive in 2009. Watching it &quot;feels like watching someone win the lottery,&quot; writes Orland, thanks to a seemingly random streak of entrance and exit stairways right next to each other, allowing for a rapid, safe descent through the dungeon. Groobo lucked out again on the ninth floor, nabbing the Naj&#x27;s Puzzler item needed for later teleporting exploits.

Perhaps some nice buttered abbots? Sprinkled with freshly plucked silicon ants? And a side helping of heavily salted gangsters? With some crusty cyberpunk cities for dessert? Let&#x27;s have a look at this week&#x27;s new PC games, then.

Quick, tidy the house, book in the playdates, get the shopping done, catch-up on sleep. And do some reading, obviously.

Taková je přibližně podle Viléma Kledrowetze z Ústavu mikroelektroniky FEKT VUT stávající poptávka po lidech v oblasti čipů a moderních polovodičů. I proto letos v září na fakultě otevřou ojedinělý bakalářský a magisterský program, který bude právě na tuto oblast zaměřen. Propojí teorii s praxí, nabídne zkušenosti odborníků z jiných fakult a z průmyslu i množství zajímavých stáží v Česku a ve světě.</span>

                              <span>At least on paper, Real-Debrid&#x27;s November 2024 announcement detailing new anti-piracy measures, suggested a tough time ahead for the popular platform. Under pressure from dozens of powerful rightsholders, Real-Debrid&#x27;s position looked precarious to put it mildly; not precarious enough for the service to throw in the towel, however. Three months later, a 16% drop in traffic is painful but non-fatal.

It’s the sad, sleepy tale of a musician, Rama, who is trying to put his life back together and reconnect with his old bandmates in Jakarta a year after the death of his girlfriend, Cinta. The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game&#x27;s 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen.

                              <span>In an ultimately failed attempt at cobbling some Elden Ring: Nightreign impressions together, I spent a little over three hours of my Valentine’s Day fruitlessly trying to get a match going in the roguelike spinoff’s doomed PS5 network test. I hope said test provided FromSoft with some helpful data, considering Nightreign releases in May, though it would have been a lot easier for everyone if I could’ve just sent Hidetaka Miyazaki an email saying &quot;Sir, your server infrastructure is made of biscuits.&quot;
In the interests of a more productive outcome, here are some lovely/interesting/terrifying little PC games that I could have started and finished while waiting for the closed beta to sort itself out, and that you might enjoy regardless of whether you’ve just spaffed away a perfectly good afternoon.

                              <span>There&#x27;s something uncanny about dipping &quot;classic&quot; games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr&#x27;s work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn&#x27;t quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there&#x27;s a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.

When they got hold of detailed audience data for Civilization 6, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII&#x27;s new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you&#x27;re either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.

Sometimes a blossoming genre can be obvious, as when a huge success like Doom or Dark Souls comes along and inspires games for decades to follow. But sometimes a new genre is quiet, low-key, hiding just beneath the surface of a tumultuous industry. Sometimes you have to go fishing for it.

                              <span>Elden Ring Nightreign will get &quot;additional playable characters and bosses&quot; via DLC, according to an entry on the game&#x27;s Steam page. This isn&#x27;t massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla Elden Ring. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, Dark Souls trilogy, Sekiro and Bloodborne reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.

                              <span>I’m not saying you should play Avowed on a Steam Deck, merely that you can play Avowed on a Steam Deck. Much like how Nic found the game itself, squishing Obsidian’s latest RPG into a handheld makes for a sometimes-good, sometimes-terrible time, for reasons mostly shared between the Deck’s relative lack of horsepower and Avowed’s hardware-agnostic proclivity for stuttering.

From the VPN provider&#x27;s perspective, site blocking threatens online freedom. Swiss provider ProtonVPN describes blocking as &#x27;a dangerous attack on Internet freedom on the altar of corporate greed&#x27;.

It’s easy to lose moments watching the ambience of the gameboard change in the demo for haunted house RPG The Horror At Highrook. The colours alter from daytime greyness through winey shades of sunset into pale lavender moonlight. There are little details to notice and zoom on: a fleeting embroidery of rain, the seep of flames in the kitchen and guest rooms, a fidgeting of moths in the archives. Ah, nice. The last time I felt so beguiled by a view of a house was while looking out from the hamlet of Darkest Dungeon.

                              <span>Avowed has more The Outer Worlds DNA in it than just the Obsidian link, and from a technical perspective, that might be worrisome – the latter RPG’s Spacer’s Choice Edition was one of the most wretchedly broken releases of 2023.
Happily, Avowed does at least launch in much better shape, and with some genuinely fetching fantasy visuals that may even justify flicking on ray tracing. The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.

                              <span>Gosh, haven&#x27;t done one of these in a while, have we? Or possibly one of these. Or these?! The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we&#x27;re back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian&#x27;s latest RPG Avowed. We&#x27;ve all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!
Nic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?
James: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.
Otherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.
Nic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special &#x27;smash me&#x27; icon on them. I don&#x27;t want a crate to &quot;come hither&quot; me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.
It&#x27;s funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed&#x27;s strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?

                              <span>Anime action game Stellar Blade has been confirmed for PC release in June 2025. Developed by South Korean studio Shift Up and published by Sony, it&#x27;s about fighting monsters on post-apocalyptic Earth by means of combos, parries and gauge-based super moves. It&#x27;s got an open world full of NPC quest-givers and creatures designed by Hee-Cheol Jang, the mad scientist behind the menageries of Okja and The Host. It&#x27;s also got a protagonist we can summarise as Bayonetta played straight.

                              <span>Avowed is almost good, but there&#x27;s something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.
And that should be that, really. I&#x27;d run through all the ways Obsidian&#x27;s latest didn&#x27;t quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it&#x27;s on Games Pass, and we&#x27;d all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.
But, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.
Ignore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it&#x27;s like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol&#x27; time until a reinstallation of Nvidia&#x27;s loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I&#x27;m frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.

And I realised that, no, this is some glorious nonsense. Maximum ham. High-concept cheeseville. Pseudostravaganza. I mean all these phrases as compliments. Come now - let your illusions dissolve as the fragile structure of your reality is exposed by the wildfire violence of this furious trailer!

Kotick appeared on venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins podcast earlier this week, alongside former EA CEO and current Kleiner Perkins advisor Bing Gordon. Discussing the above legal cases alongside petitions to remove him as CEO, Kotick spoke of &quot;fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that weren&#x27;t true,&quot; claiming his former company was &quot;targeted&quot; by the CWA in a bid to increase union membership.

                              <span>We interrupt our regular schedule of fish puns and naughty jokes about holes to warn you that a huge chunk of celestial debris has a 2.3% chance of impacting Earth in December 2032 and wiping out the city of Bradford. I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. Asteroid 2024 YR4 loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.


If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool Asteroid Launcher, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.

                              <span>The flash flood of marketing that poured forth from PlayStation&#x27;s State Of Play last night splashes wetly upon we PC players too. Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for Borderlands 4 in a short &#x27;n&#x27; shooty trailer. I&#x27;m not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when Grand Theft Auto 6 will not release. And that&#x27;s mildly interesting.

You&#x27;ll be exploring a lost space colony as Arjun Devraj, a &quot;Soltari Enforcer&quot; played by Midnight Mass actor and big nerd Rahul Kohli. The planet you&#x27;re on is named &#x27;Carcosa&#x27;, perhaps suggesting a continuation of the cosmic horror bits that Returnal did so well.

                              <span>French football clubs held emergency talks after broadcaster DAZN withheld millions of euros in TV rights payments due this month. The dispute concerns DAZN&#x27;s claims that Ligue 1 football league body LFP failed to suppress piracy and fell short in other areas too. Hopes of an amicable solution faded when DAZN paid 50% of the sum owed for February and put the other €35 million into an escrow account.  LFP responded by launching legal action in Paris.

I got the sudden urge to make image-based cards, and so this thread was born! In here I&#x27;ll make a bunch of image based cards, that I hope y&#x27;all will enjoy!
But first, credit where credit&#x27;s due, a big thanks to @aschefield101 for both card blanks and foil effects!

A huge thanks goes...</span>

                              <span>Krátké úvodní upozornění: Pokud je pro vás novinkou, že Captain Americe je už několik let černoch, pak tato recenze ani tento film nejsou pro vás.
Film Captain America: Nový svět (který má v úvodních titulcích pouze &quot;Brave New World&quot; a žádného Captaina) je pravděpodobně začátkem nové filmové megasérie, která nám v příštích filmech pravděpodobně představí &quot;nové&quot; Avengers, nové X-Men a pravděpodobně také nové multiverzní nebezpečí. Píšu několikrát &quot;pravděpodobně&quot;, protože musím přiznat, že se v aktuálním Marvel vesmíru neorientuji tolik, jako jsem se v minulých desetiletích orientoval ve filmových X-Men a Hulkovi (protože jsem je překládal).
(Tato recenze je bez spoilerů, pokud za spoilery nepokládáte to, co je vidět na plakátech a v trailerech.)
Takže: Drama je rozehráno atentátem na nového…</span>

This comes after they paused development of mechsuit FPS sequel Crysis 4 last year, with staff shifting over to Showdown’s live service reboot Hunt: Showdown 1896. Crytek now say they need to cut back in order to remain “financially sustainable”.

Here&#x27;s a trailer&#x27;s worth of wiggly whooshes, big bangs and exowotsits to celebrate. Mmm, exowotsits. They used to be 25p a bag in the 1990s.

In a few short months, you and up to two friends will be called upon to rush a few bosses on a large, shrinking map set in the same universe as the 2022 open worlder. Is it the Elden Ring sequel many would like? No. Is it going to kindle similar feelings of frustration, despair and sporadic religious ecstasy? The omens seem good.

                              <span>Well, this is nice. Remedy&#x27;s exceptionally good horror game Alan Wake 2 is finally making royalties for the studio for the first time since its release in late 2023, after shifting over 2 million copies. The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.
As of September last year, the musical-with-guns had &quot;recouped most of its development and marketing expenses&quot;, but still wasn&#x27;t quite in the green. Since then, they&#x27;ve released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. &quot;October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2,&quot; says the report.

                              <span>Game engine company Unity are making yet another round of job cuts across various departments, from software development to advertising. They&#x27;ve yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they&#x27;re now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as &quot;completely abrupt and impersonal&quot;. Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he&#x27;d lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.

                              <span>Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO &quot;fake&quot;, and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.
Kotick&#x27;s statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.
That petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company&#x27;s board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn&#x27;t just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick&#x27;s resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.

The playtest isn&#x27;t real, say Unknown Worlds, who point out that any such invite will only come in an email from their own domain.

                              <span>Scammers exploited a subdomain of the European Food Safety Authority to actively redirect people to piracy scams and other dubious ploys. The pages that promised free content, including Super Bowl streams, appeared high in Google&#x27;s search results. After being alerted, the EU agency swiftly addressed the vulnerability, but further vigilance is advised.

                              <span>Unexplained chaos at ISPs Movistar and DIGI has prevented some customers from accessing many sites using Cloudflare for over a week. Simultaneously, football league LaLiga stated they are working to shut down pirate streaming platforms, warning Cloudflare and others that they consider them responsible for profiting from piracy.  Since statements now link these two events, Spain has a crisis on its hands.

                              <span>Last week, several innovative copyright protection tools were discussed at WIPO’s Advisory Committee on Enforcement. One particularly interesting presentation came from the Portuguese company NOS Technology, which highlighted its AI-powered anti-piracy tool. Among other things, the toolbox can help to block pirated content automatically, with a direct connection at the ISP level.

The spider monster is called the Lala Barina. If I saw &quot;Lala Barina&quot; out of context I would assume I was reading about a successor to Suzuki&#x27;s subcompact automobile the Holden Barina, whose brave and sturdy outline once graced the roads of Oceania. I would not picture a giant, greasy rose blossom with jet-black darting mandibles. I would not picture nests of scarlet silk and status effects literally out the wazoo.

Yes, what would you do, with an infinite shoe?
Would you melt it to make yourself infinite glue?
Or to infinite dogs &#x27;pon which to infinitely chew?
Would you keep ajar infinite doors…alright enough of that. I&#x27;m very sorry. I had too much cheap energy drink for breakfast and it appears to have given me rhyming cancer. Also, the urge to browse the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods, to see what players of the RPG were downloading most at the moment. I find there&#x27;s usually a sweet spot before anything too substantial hits a game&#x27;s Nexus Mods page where you can use the most popular mods as an interesting barometer to what sort of game people actually want to be playing. The theme here? Players seem to love the idea of a gritty realistic medieval game in theory, but actually secretly enjoy having the inconvenient edges sanded off.

And that decision to build small is going to be the plan from now on. No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.

He Is Coming, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike RPG. You&#x27;ll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.
Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You&#x27;re actually on the clock: the &#x27;he&#x27; of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.

Gotech was previously hit with a widely publicized $101m judgment following a Nagravision copyright lawsuit. Yet, not only was the amount never paid, the judgment was fully vacated. In what can only be described as a bizarre finale,  GoTech now promotes Nagra as its partner.

                              <span>Last March, Sega sold off Company Of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War developers Relic Entertainment in the course of wider &quot;restructuring&quot;, &quot;realigning&quot; and lay-offening at the house of Sonic. Relic&#x27;s new corporate partners are a holding company established by the UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP - an arrangement that apparently lets them operate like an independent studio, though I&#x27;m fuzzy on the moving parts.

                              <span>Cheery mom-and-pop computer game business Valve have created a new Steamworks page for their policy about in-game adverts and advertising in general, with a troubleshooter&#x27;s list of dos and don&#x27;ts for developers.
As Graham pointed out to me just now, Valve&#x27;s handling of such things hasn&#x27;t really changed over the past few years, but I can&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to chew the fat a little about the intriguingly murky, slippery-slope business of turning your virtual world into an ad platform. Also, I had already written this article by the time he pointed that out to me, and I can&#x27;t bear to send all my precious words to the abyss.

We didn&#x27;t get early code, and our usual method of sidestepping this issue by rapidly entering the numbers and letters spelled out by our extensive collection of longhorn beetles bore no fruit. Rest assured: it&#x27;s coming. Sin reviewed it for EuroVega though, awarding it two out of a possible five beetles. While she found it largely dull, she did mention that &quot;its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable&quot;. Firaxis seem to agree, putting out a statement last Friday following feedback from the game&#x27;s advanced access period.

Obviously I can&#x27;t actually respond to that, so I&#x27;ll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media&#x27;s Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of &#x27;digital piracy&#x27;. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.
This follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.

                              <span>This week is the week of Valentine&#x27;s Day, and therefore theoretically the most romantic week of the year even though it&#x27;s still winter here and the drizzle feels like it&#x27;s falling inside my bones and the thought of another human&#x27;s touch makes me want to wipe myself with sandpaper.
Some trivia from a person who&#x27;s been in a relationship for decades: Valentine&#x27;s Day comes less than a month after &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, the most depressing day of the year according to a random travel company, and you know, I think we need more time to, as it were, switch between varieties of blueness. My picks for this week&#x27;s new PC games likely won&#x27;t help, assuming you aren&#x27;t especially turned on by the thought of Harriet Tubman being queen of Carthage. Ah well. Let&#x27;s commence feeding the Maw and hope that we strike a few sparks of amore from the creature&#x27;s heaving flanks.

                              <span>God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.
The implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don&#x27;t have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.
Have you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.

That never happened for me with music critic Neil Kulkarni, though I must have read his work given the music magazines he wrote for. That changed a couple of weeks ago when I went to Kieron&#x27;s (RPS in peace) newsletter in search of his piece in rememberance of J Nash (included in a prior Papers), in which he linked to his similar piece on Kulkarni, who passed last year. I read the examples of Kulkarni&#x27;s work that Kieron linked, and then the Kulkarni articles the man himself linked, and several hours and several layers deep, I thought: oh no, Neil Kulkarni was one of my guys.

                              <span>Recognition of transparency in the FADPA site blocking bill is welcome, but will it become reality? So far, many blocking regimes have lacked transparency. The true scale of site blocking action in Europe, let alone the world, is effectively proprietary information to which the public has zero access. It may be the ideal time for global site blocking to implement global transparency by default.

                              <span>Roguelike deckbuilders need to do something pretty special to stand out nowadays, what with the Slay The Spileup of bangers over the past few years. Cobalt Core, Wildfrost, Shogun Showdown (if you squint). All excellent, but Diceomancer stands out above even those, thanks to a clever gimmick and a hefty dose of chutzpah. It’s there in the strapline, you know the deal, but to emphasise: you can reroll ANY number on your screen. 

Your health, enemy health, attacks, blocks, buffs, mana, gold - all fair game. The numbers in encounters. On Relics. Have at ‘em! Heck, and that’s before you start scribbling in the rulebook.

Rocksteady Studios haven&#x27;t said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims &quot;the new project is years away from landing&quot;, so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio&#x27;s open world Batman games.

                              <span>Path tracing has been back on the PC hardware agenda recently, with Nvidia’s sales pitch for the GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 more than lightly based on how good they are at shotgunning this premium graphics tech down your eye stalks. Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.
We’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment. Even if it takes a graphics card upgrade to do so.

                              <span>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that Grand Theft Auto 6 is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly financial earnings. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA&#x27;s arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.

                              <span>The Nvidia RTX 5080 is out! Kind of. In theory. If you can find one. But here’s the thing: it&#x27;s basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.

The release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was spotted this week, hiding in the long grass of the PlayStation Store. The fancy-schmancy MGS3 remake is coming out in August, according to the store page. And you can also catch sight of a camouflaged trailer if you go looking under the right rocks.

                              <span>Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio&#x27;s employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel Smite 2 as a free-to-play beta. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they&#x27;re being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable.

                              <span>What great hopes I had for the Christmas holidays. Finally, I thought, I would have time for some of the recent blockbusters I&#x27;d not yet played: Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and more would fill those dusty days and nights in the taint of 2024.

Then I mentioned in a review that I liked Picross games, which for me can dissolve hours or entire weekends like sugar in water. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if that means I should recommend Mark Ffrench&#x27;s games Proverbs and Mega Mosaic to you, or warn you to steer clear and avoid flowing away forever,&quot; responded commenter SeekerX.

You see where this is going. Friends, I played Proverbs for 36 hours over Christmas.

Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be given a refund, they say.

                              <span>In their ongoing battle against online sports piracy, French rightsholders are now seeking to extend site-blocking measures to VPN providers. Canal+ and the football league LFP have requested court orders to compel NordVPN, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, and others to block access to pirate sites and services. The move follows similar orders obtained last year against DNS resolvers.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not the destination, they say, it&#x27;s the pickled eggs we slurped along the way. In Keep Driving, a turn-based RPG of swishing scenery and smooshed roadkill, you are on a road trip in the early 2000s that will see you gulping coffee and stuffing cheap snacks into your mouth, all in an effort to get to the other side of the country in time for the big concert. It is a hypnotically involving game of picking up hitchhikers and battling tailgaters, a pixel art drivealong with tactile, chunky buttons and perfectly suited sound effects, as much fuelled by nostalgia as it is by gasoline. At first, I thought it was too loose and open-ended to elicit any deep feelings. But then I had to sell my guitar for half a tank of petrol, just to visit my dying grandmother. Dude, this is a game that goes places.

                              <span>Earlier this week, a plastic bag blowing in the wind made me question all I knew about the world, but in whatever way the opposite of life-affirming is. Less blowing, actually. More taunting me from my screen maddeningly like a middle finger salute from a man with no hands. It was a baffling piece of licensed merch from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM and Atelier, who I assume are three hyenas in a board room sniffing each other&#x27;s crotches for eternity.
I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly where I first saw the bag - which has actually been on sale for a few months now - but I soon realised why it had likely entered the zeitgeist again: an extensive set of a documentary podcasts by YouTube creator The 41st Precinct, the latest of which interviews writers Dora Klindžić and Argo Tuulik for more time than I have ever spent on anything. Here&#x27;s a clip on Atelier and that fucking bag.

                              <span>True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.
In theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.

                              <span>The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer Duskers are making a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the 2016 space game. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they&#x27;re currently working on. The working title for this one is &quot;Humanity 2.0&quot; and it&#x27;ll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you&#x27;ll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer &quot;fun personality quirks&quot; when you install upgrades, &quot;like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it&#x27;s now claustrophobic&quot;. 
Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I&#x27;m interested.

                              <span>Sci-fi battle royale Apex Legends is due a &quot;meaningful update&quot; , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he&#x27;s called &quot;Apex 2.0&quot;. To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game&#x27;s name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it&#x27;s not clear if that&#x27;s exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they&#x27;re prepared to tell folks in a financial report.

Chytré kamery pomohou sektoru automotive k vyšší spolehlivosti výroby. Pure Storage v ČR svá úložiště nejen vyvíjí – v pardubickém Foxconnu probíhá i výroba.
