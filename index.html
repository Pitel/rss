                              <span>Rockstar have confirmed that they won’t support their digital Westworld of Red Dead Online with any further major content updates, as the development of the next Grand Theft Auto takes priority. The news came via a post on Rockstar’s newswire blog. Players among the Red Dead Online community have been vocal about their disappointment at the game’s apparent lack of support, with some even deciding to organise a funeral for the multiplayer cowboy spin-off scheduled for July 13th.

A Building Full Of Cats does seem like a game cats might make, a hidden object game with so very many cats to &#x27;pet&#x27; (find and click on). It&#x27;s some nice cat-clicking for under £2.

Devs Supermassive Games are referring to the multiplayer as ‘Wolf Pack’, which makes me wish Zach Galifianakis would pop up to comment on your playthrough. Refresh your memory about Hacket’s Quarry by watching the launch trailer below.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the early access experience of Vampire Survivors, hopping back on every few weeks to check out a new update and do all the new stuff (and make all the new explosions). The roguelikelike survival arcade game has grown a lot, and fast, especially considering it started as a solo project. As it nears version 1.0, the latest big update has added a new final boss to the final level, a flashy battle.

That’s why I’m slightly disappointed that Supermassive Games didn&#x27;t hire the legendary 1980s actor to star in The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil In Me, which revealed a little more about its spooky murder doll house in a new story trailer. I’m sure you’ll be thoroughly creeped out when you watch it below.

                              <span>Modders have been getting busy with FSR 2.0, AMD’s latest, recently open source-ified, Nvidia DLSS-esque upscaling tech. First someone got FSR 2.0 working in Cyberpunk 2077, then someone modded the Cyberpunk mod to get FSR in Dying Light 2, and then someone discovered the mod of the mod could also mod Metro Exodus. Now, redditor Muddymind has figured out how to tweak the Metro mod so that it can act as an Nvidia DLAA clone, skipping the upscaling bit to solely provide better image quality and anti-aliasing.

That&#x27;s a historic low price.

                              <span>Another argument for having multiple region accounts
A Pokemon Puzzle League Switch release is arriving on July 15, via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack service. Notably, this comes eight years after the Game Boy Color-based Pokemon Puzzle Challenge was re-released on 3DS.
It&#x27;s our irregularly scheduled Nintendo 64 booster, and as usual Japan is getting something a little different.
Here is what the US is getting (Pokemon Puzzle League)

Alternatively, here is what Japan is getting (Custom Robo, and Custom Robot V2):
https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1545212433035595776
As a recap, Pokemon Puzzle League was released in the US in 2000, as part of the Puzzle League, or, Panel de Pon series. It was basically a &quot;branded version&quot; of Panel de Pon, a franchise that came over as Tetris Attack and was immortalized ever since. Although a lot of people are going to write off &quot;a puzzle game coming to Switch Online,&quot; if you haven&#x27;t played it, give it a shot! Panel de Pon is a classic for a reason, and Pokemon Puzzle League does a great job of getting the core gameplay tenets of the series across.
That said, it would be fantastic to get Custom Robo as well, even if it was in untranslated form. This is where having multiple region accounts comes in handy, as I can just swap over to my Japanese login and play them if I want!

According to multiple sources, GameStop is initiating huge layoffs across its entire company, with redundancies expected to hit on an executive and store level, as well as the editorial team of tie-in-press outlet, Game Informer. While GameStop is yet to officially confirm the news, affected employees and industry insiders have already spread the grim news on social media.
GameStop&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer Mike Recupero — who stepped into the role in the wake of the bizarre &quot;GameStonks&quot; scandal one year ago — has already resigned from the company. According to a staff memo, penned by GameStop CEO Matt Furlong and seen by Axios reporter Stephen Totilo, GameStop expects &quot;a number of&quot; incoming redundancies as part of a major cost-cutting exer…</span>

                              <span>A Rough Deal
[Update: Daniel Mullins Games has confirmed that a PlayStation port of Inscryption is en route. A release date was not confirmed.]
One of our favorite spoilers, the Australian Classification ratings board, has updated its website with a new PlayStation listing for Daniel Mullins Games&#x27; deck-builder Inscryption, suggesting that the spooky roguelike card game is headed to PS4 in the very near future.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;OPBP3kWDcNk
Released on PC in the fall of 2021, Inscryption turned plenty of heads in double-quick time with its incredibly creepy and disturbing aesthetic, compelling strategy gameplay, and fascinating &quot;found footage&quot; framing device. The indie hit would go on to feature in many Best of Year lists, even winning the Game of the Year award at the prestigious Game Developers Choice Award and the Seamus McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Awards.
While the title is yet to receive an announcement of any such port, this new rating all but confirms that Inscryption is headed to the console market. While this rating is strictly for PlayStation platforms, it is difficult to imagine that publisher Devolver Digital will not also be looking to release on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. We will be sure to give you a heads up when official confirmation is forthcoming.
Inscryption is available now on PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.

Patch 0.8.0 is out today for Vampire Survivors, and it hits the mark. With limit breaks further fueling the power fantasy — and the ability to auto-pick coin bags or floor chickens when leveling up — the horde-mowing action feels non-stop.
Wait, limit breaks? Yeah. With the new relic, Great Gospel, you&#x27;ll be able to boost weapons to a ridiculous degree once everything else is maxed out. So instead of the normal money-or-food choice when you level up toward the end of a run, you&#x27;ll be able to crank up stats like Area, Speed, and Might (with a percentage boost) on your favorite weapons.
Limit breaks are a toggle in Vampire Survivors, and to use them (they reset every run), you&#x27;ll first need to pry the Great Gospel from a new boss&#x27;s cold, skeletal hands. F…</span>

                              <span>Now you can take Dicey Dungeons on the go
Dicey Dungeons is one of those &quot;if you know, you know&quot; indie games — it&#x27;s garnered something of a cult following over the past three years that it&#x27;s been out, and for good reason (we gave it a 10 in our review). The charming visuals, unique concept, and engaging gameplay have made the game a continued success, and after some releases for Nintendo Switch and Xbox, Dicey Dungeons is finally getting a mobile release for iOS and Android. In addition to the new platform, the game is also getting a free DLC update called Reunion, which will give players 4-5 hours of new gameplay released in six episodes.
The game&#x27;s creator Terry Cavanagh dropped the news earlier today on his Twitter — he&#x27;s also known for creating other titles like VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Cavanagh has secured his spot as a prolific game designer in the indie space, so it&#x27;s really cool to see his games continue to have life and community surrounding them long after their releases.
https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1545076959444717569
Not only will Dicey Dungeons run well on mobile devices, but its gameplay actually suits the platform really well. Roguelikes are great to play in short bursts, and since it&#x27;s turn-based, you don&#x27;t have to be glued to the screen every second if you don&#x27;t want to be. That makes Dicey Dungeons perfect for playing on your phone during a commute, or when you&#x27;re waiting at the DMV, or when you&#x27;re doing literally anything else.
Cavanagh even confirmed in the replies to his initial tweet that you can easily stop in the middle of a run and continue it later without losing any of your progress.
Dicey Dungeons is available for $4.99 on iOS and Android, and the free DLC update is live now as well. The game&#x27;s composer Chipzel also released the DLC soundtrack on Bandcamp if you want to take a listen to that as well.

                              <span>The King of the Koopas gets a LEGO makeover
Making LEGO sets that are designed with adults in mind is one of the best decisions the company ever made, because LEGO has released some really awesome, complex builds over the past few years. Just in their Nintendo collaboration alone, which debuted in 2020, they gave us the buildable NES and the &quot;?&quot; block with different levels from Super Mario 64 on the inside. LEGO&#x27;s newest release is another banger in the Mario-themed line: a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs.
I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t played with LEGO since I was a kid, but man, they&#x27;ve really stepped up their game over the past few years. The Might Bowser figure is made of up over 3,000 pieces, some of which were designed specifically for this build. He&#x27;s incredibly detailed, but this Bowser doesn&#x27;t just look great — you can move his head around and shoot a little LEGO fireball out of his mouth. In addition, the Senior Designer on the project Carl Merriam says that they &quot;took inspiration from a few forms of puppetry&quot; and added loose joints to Bowser&#x27;s legs and tail so he looks like he&#x27;s jumping when you pick him up.

But wait, there&#x27;s more! LEGO fans who own a LEGO Super Mario Starter Course can actually battle against Bowser with Mario, Luigi, or Peach.
Basically, if you take your little interactive figure from that set and bounce it on Bowser, it will make noises from the game and play battle animations. How cool is that? It&#x27;s that extra attention to detail that makes this a really impressive build, in my opinion.
The Mighty Bowser figure hits stores on October 1, 2022, and will retail for $269.99 on the LEGO website or wherever LEGO is sold, so start saving up now if you&#x27;re dying to add him to your collection!

                              <span>Shiny adventure to become shinier still
THQ Nordic has announced that it will release an upgraded edition of its zen-like adventure game Biomutant on PS5 and Xbox Series X this fall. The revamped release will be available to purchase on both platforms from September 6, with free upgrades offered to PS4 and Xbox One Biomutant players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PismKvxhFpc
Released in the spring of 2021 after a particularly lengthy development period, Biomutant is an ecological tale of a fantasy world under siege from a mysterious and creeping corruption. Players guide a fully customizable character through the anthropomorphic society on a mission to rescue the Tree of Life, the roots of which are decaying due to the corruption&#x27;s presence. Developed by Experiment 101, Biomutant was an extremely ambitious project, that unfortunately launch to very middling reviews, though it was praised for its impressive visuals and interesting custom character mechanics.
This new edition of Biomutant will offer players three distinct visual modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X. &quot;Quality,&quot; which will run at 30 FPS  at a 4K resolution; &quot;Quality Unleashed,&quot; which will run at &quot;40-plus&quot; FPS at a 4K resolution; and &quot;Performance,&quot; which will run at 60 FPS at 1440p. For Xbox Series S users, these three modes will run at 1440p, 1440p, and 1080p respectively. The PS5 edition will also be optimized for the DualSense, offering support for Haptic Feedback, adaptive triggers, and speaker sound. Both editions will support faster load times and will arrive fully updated in regards to patches.
Biomutant is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

It wasn&#x27;t long ago that Monster Hunter Rise was updated to version 10.0.2, but it&#x27;s clear Capcom has been working its little socks off, because version 10.0.3 is now live for all players.
The latest update isn&#x27;t as meaty as the previous one (which makes sense given a lot of it was earmarked for the Sunbreak DLC), but it does introduce some important bug patches and improvements that you&#x27;ll want to get downloaded.

Cygames may be known for its success in the mobile space with titles like Granblue Fantasy, Shadowverse, and Dragalia Lost (with which the developer partnered with Nintendo) but the company seems like it has an interest in translating these IPs into more traditional console games. Last year’s excellent Shadowverse: Champion&#x27;s Battle showed that the popular card game could work quite effectively in the format of a JRPG, and now Cygames is doing it again by taking Battle Champs—a failed Clash of Clans clone—and repurposing it into a roguelite called Little Noah: Scion of Paradise. Though it’s lacking in new ideas, Little Noah does a fantastic job of giving players a tough, cute, and enjoyable action experience that feels great to play.
The story follows Noah, the chipper alchemist captain of a majestic airship, who quickly finds herself trapped when her airship crashes just outside mysterious shifting ruins. Here, she soon meets a snarky amnesiac cat (who is not named Morgana…) and a creepy villain called Greigh who both seem to have some kind of connection to her lost father. Left with no choice but to scour the ruins for the parts she’ll need to repair her ship, Noah thus sets out on an adventure to save Zipper (the cat) from Greigh and maybe learn more about what happened to her father.

Back in the &#x27;90s, whoever thought that Nintendo would team up with JRPG giants Square Enix (then known as Square or Squaresoft) to create a Mario RPG starring the Italian plumber, Princess Peach, and Bowser? Not us! But they did, and we&#x27;re forever grateful for the existence of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.
Despite Mario continuing to venture into the RPG genre with two separate series — Paper Mario and Mario &amp; Luigi — we&#x27;ve never seen a direct sequel to Square&#x27;s original Mario RPG or even a remake, only ports via Virtual Console or on the SNES Classic. But leave it to the fans to create something truly special — a modern-day mock-up of what a Super Mario RPG remake might look like.

                              <span>Locking in September.
After quietly announcing a western release date just a few days ago, Square Enix has now shared a brand new trailer for its upcoming strategy RPG, The DioField Chronicle.
The trailer, shared by Nintendo Everything, is only in Japanese for the time being, but it shows off a snippet of gameplay outside of the tactical battles. But don&#x27;t worry, there are plenty of those diorama-style skirmishes to see in the short trailer too.

Featured as part of Nacon&#x27;s Connect 2022 presentation, a new trailer for RoboCop: Rogue City has revealed gameplay and shed more light on the return of Detroit&#x27;s cybernetic law enforcer, including a first glimpse of veteran actor Peter Weller, who was revealed to be returning to the role of Alex Murphy in Robo-form.

Round Up: Every Nintendo Switch Game Featured During Nacon Connect 2022

The trailer features first-person footage from the game, as well as a look at various dialogue cutscenes and ol&#x27; Robo drawers himself without his visor at the end. While it&#x27;s obvious that this isn&#x27;t footage of the Switch version of the game, it&#x27;s great to get an idea of what developer Teyon has lined up. Rogue City is scheduled to launch in June 2023 — check it out above.

When the N64 library was originally announced for the Switch Online Expansion Pack, Nintendo teased a few other games - specifically for Japan. These titles were the N64 gems Custom Robo and Custom Robo V2.
Now, alongside the news today that Pokémon Puzzle League will be added to the service on 15th July, Nintendo has revealed Japan will (instead) be receiving the previously announced Custom Robo games on the same date.

Last month, Nintendo added Pokémon Snap to the Switch Online Expansion Pack service, and since then, fans have been wondering what&#x27;s next for the N64&#x27;s digital library.
It seems from here on out, Nintendo may not be providing a future schedule for what&#x27;s on the way - with the surprise announcement today that the service will be getting Pokémon Puzzle League. This Panel de Pon-style puzzle game was originally released on the Nintendo 64 in the year 2000.

Back in February I looked at the situation again and Linux started outrunning Windows 11 on the i9-12900K with the latest Linux kernel at the time. But with a few more months having passed and for the Intel Alder Lake hybrid processors to mature under Windows and Linux, how do things stand now? Here are some new benchmarks.</span>

                              <span>The creator is fully aware of the &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t spread this around&quot; comments!
As is the case with every fan creation that&#x27;s openly shared on Twitter, YouTube, and plenty of other places directly by the creator themselves, I should note that this is yet another &quot;the creator has directly shared this on Twitter&quot; situation. Digital artist Finn shared the latest footage of their Super Mario RPG remake on Twitter, which reworks the graphical system of the game into a new charming modern style.
Note that Finn has their response to the &quot;but you shouldn&#x27;t share these types of things online&quot; statement already ready to go:
&quot;Just thought I’d put this out there since I’ve seen some stuff floating around: My SMRPG project, while made in a game engine, will not be available to play, for legal reasons:) similarly, I do not plan to remake a significant portion of the game as to not infringe on copyright.&quot;

That&#x27;s why I put the phrase &quot;mockup&quot; in the headline. While this was initially shared around as a project that could see the light of day, Finn cleared things up themselves; noting that they wanted to share their artistry with the world without distributing it, or remaking the entire game.
Still, you love to see it. These types of fan projects lead to full official releases more often than you&#x27;d think, and although it would take a lot of legwork to get this one off the ground, I hope it happens one day.

                              <span>How games depict America, for better and for worse
It was fun to sit on my rooftop and watch the fireworks over the Los Angeles cityscape for the Fourth of July this year, but I gotta be honest — it didn’t feel like there was much to celebrate this year. Regardless of the depressing state of our country, the holiday got me thinking about Americana in video games and how they depict our country, for better and for worse.
Aside from Japan, the United States is the world’s leader in video game production, so it makes perfect sense that developers would borrow themes, imagery, and iconography from their country of origin. Sometimes it’s to pay homage to where they came from, other times it’s with the express purpose of critiquing the systems and ideals that run our nation, and sometimes it’s a…</span>

Why be a first-person-shooter when you can be a first-person-shooter-hack-n-slash-fighting-game-driving-game-open-world-indie-RPG? That was the question asked by Studio FYQD&#x27;s dynamic PC actioner Bright Memory: Infinite. And soon, console owners can find the answer to that query themselves, with a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch port releasing on July 21.
The work of almost a single developer, Bright Memory: Infinite tells the anime-infused tale of Shelia, a special agent dispatched to scenes of inexplicable anomalies. Kitted out with some incredible firepower and acrobatic, air-slicing sword skills, Shelia finds herself embroiled in interdimensional chaos, fighting off an army of invaders and questionable governmental conspirators in the eye of a raging storm.

While the trailers may give something of an impression of a full-price, 30-hour adventure, it should be noted that Bright Memory: Infinite is a very short affair, working better as a flashy score-attack title, to be played and replayed in efforts to achieve a slicker and more balletic performance each time. It&#x27;s undeniably a fabulous-looking title, and the talent of its one-man team cannot be understated, but it&#x27;s certainly something of an acquired taste. I dig it.
Bright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on July 21. The console port will feature all previously released costume DLC and support for Haptic Feedback, Gyroscopic Aiming, and other console-specific features.

Though big-name games can dominate the discussion, there are some cool indie projects slotted for the coming months. Today, PlayStation showcased seven indie games coming to PlayStation 4 and PS5 in the future.
All of these games have either been previously announced, or previously released on other platforms. That said, it&#x27;s an honestly great collection of rad games worth keeping an eye on, especially if some have slipped you by.
Sea of Stars
First up is Sea of Stars, the classic RPG from Sabotage Studio, which made The Messenger. It recently got delayed into 2023, but today Sabotage showed off some gameplay and mechanics. Actions can build up combos, and timed hits can increase your damage and mitigate incoming hits.

                              <span>No name yet, but here&#x27;s a teaser
The &quot;one last thing&quot; at the Nacon Connect 2022 showcase was a new Terminator game for PC and consoles, and while we don&#x27;t have a name yet — or anything concrete, footage-wise — we do know this is the &quot;first survival game set in the Terminator universe.&quot;
I bet you can predict everything that happens in this teaser trailer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_HNPT7efHq0
Nacon&#x27;s Terminator survival game is in production at Nacon Studio Milan, rather than Teyon, the team behind Terminator: Resistance, which some fans have rallied around.
Open-world survival in the wake of Judgment Day
&quot;The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic open world and features an original story that builds on the events of the official films,&quot; according to the studio.
&quot;You play as a group of nuclear apocalypse survivors fighting to stay alive in a time period between Judgment Day and the creation of John Connor’s resistance.&quot;
With little to grasp yet, this is a harder sell than another &#x27;80s-icon-turned-game, RoboCop: Rogue City, which shared the first look at gameplay during Nacon&#x27;s stream.
After playing way too many survival games, I can imagine what this game could look like — and really, I feel like it could go either way. Genre, scope, and budget are all top of mind when it comes to licensed games like this. And to me, this team is a wildcard. I am vaguely into the idea of fighting for life in an intimidating machine-dominated world, though.
Are you open to a Skynet survival game, or have you had your fill of Terminator tie-ins by now? Come to think of it, I&#x27;ve gone pretty deep in the Sega Genesis and SNES libraries over the years, but I&#x27;ve never touched RoboCop Versus The Terminator. Hmm.

                              <span>The long-in-development piracy game finally has a date
Skull and Bones will finally set sail this year. Ubisoft&#x27;s Skull and Bones is launching on November 8, 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud streaming services.
First up in today&#x27;s gameplay reveal of Skull and Bones was a cinematic trailer, which showed the general set-up of the game. You start out as just another person awash at sea, in a region inspired by the Indian Ocean. Over time you build up resources, get bigger boats, and take on bigger risks for greater rewards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8i2eHxj5NMU
As shown in the gameplay deep-dive, Skull and Bones allows players to set out for plunder on the high seas. They won&#x27;t be alone, however. There&#x27;s the ability to take on neutral, AI-controlled ships like merchant caravans or even fortresses, or you can sail with friends. In PvP servers, you can even run into and fight with other players.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;P_c7F4PHzcc
It&#x27;s got some extraction vibes, similar to games like Escape From Tarkov. Get in, loot, get out. As time goes on, the player can craft new and better ships with different playstyles. If the ship goes down, the player will head back to the most recent outpost with most of their cargo recovered, though some will be set out at sea for you—or other players—to recover.
A pirate&#x27;s life for me
Skull and Bones has had a long, and reportedly strenuous, development timeline. But today&#x27;s reveal seems like it&#x27;s confirming that Skull and Bones is doing what it originally set out to do: expand the sailing of Black Flag out into a full, multiplayer game. And I&#x27;m pretty intrigued. Building up a massive dreadnaught with cannons, armor, ballista, rockets, and a rowdy crew seems like an enjoyable time.
We&#x27;ll see if Skull and Bones can bring it all home when it launches on November 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Stadia, Luna, PC via Epic, and Ubisoft Connect.

Supermassive Games lifted the lid on The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me, the fourth entry in its cinematic horror-adventure series, due for release this fall. The main star this time around is Jessie Buckley, who leads a film crew into a trap-filled hotel.
Not just any hotel, of course — a &quot;faithful recreation of the H.H. Holmes murder castle.&quot;

After Man of Medan, Little Hope, and House of Ashes, this game will cap off &quot;Season One&quot; of the anthology — though it&#x27;s worth reminding that these titles stand on their own.
The reception to this series is mixed, but players like me keep showing up for comfort gaming. The recent consensus seems to be that House of Ashes was the best of the bunch — it came around in the en…</span>

Yes, there&#x27;s a RoboCop game on the way, and not to jinx us, but it looks good! Nacon and Teyon — who you might remember from another recent licensed game, Terminator: Resistance — debuted the RoboCop: Rogue City gameplay trailer at Nacon Connect 2022.
It&#x27;s hard to adapt a perfect movie into a video game, but they&#x27;re going for it.
https://youtu.be/jQ2hZ-4JCTE
In line with the 1987 movie, OmniCorp has taken control of the Detroit Police Department, and it&#x27;s now on RoboCop to clean up the streets by popping scumbags&#x27; heads. Today&#x27;s gameplay trailer showed several first-person skirmishes, including RoboCop&#x27;s iconic targeting system, and I hope Teyon goes all the way with the HUD elements.
I&#x27;m not expecting glossy high-budget FPS action, but that&#x27;s okay if they nail the little details. If this one&#x27;s &quot;for the fans,&quot; that&#x27;ll be fine. I hope it&#x27;s widely enjoyable, though.
&quot;You have the power to decide how to fulfill prime directives in your own way, but as the story unfolds proceed with caution because corruption and greed know no limit,&quot; according to the summary. It&#x27;s also confirmed that RoboCop himself, Peter Weller, will return for &quot;voiceover work on the game.&quot; It&#x27;s a check they needed to write, for sure.
The Steam page has a few more screenshots, including one with ED-209.

Remember those directives
I&#x27;m curious what kind of progression this game might have — how do you make RoboCop feel powerful without going overboard? To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t mind being totally OP. As the crime wave escalates, I&#x27;m sure OCP&#x27;s heavy weaponry will come out in full force.
RoboCop: Rogue City is in development for PC (Steam and the Epic Games Store), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. (I was surprised by that last one, but there&#x27;s a logo and everything at the end of the trailer.) It&#x27;s launching in June 2023, and I&#x27;m hopeful.

Bards are officially rocking the stage in Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Larian Studios is adding the Bard class to Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 today, alongside Gnomes as a playable race and more updates in Patch 8.
Shown off during the Panel From Hell, Bards can spur on the party and wreak havoc with their music. They can inspire teammates to greater heights, or just insult the enemy to bring them down. And crucially, they can rock a tune.
The Bard will get two subclasses, under the College of Valour and College of Lore. Valour Bards get Combat Inspiration, allowing them to stir something within their allies to add a bit to their prowess. That something being an extra D6 bonus on their next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw.

Lore Bards, meanwhile, use the…</span>

Nacon is getting set to kick off its summer Nacon Connect live stream, offering updates, trailers, and reveals pertaining to the publisher&#x27;s upcoming wares. The action will kick off in about 15 minutes&#x27; time and is expected to run for around an hour in length. You can check out the action in the stream below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;jwkTwMa3c-A
Nacon has been pretty forthcoming about the titles it will be spotlighting during the stream. We can expect new updates on robo-revolution title Steelrising, Lord of the Rings adventure Gollum, racers Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown and WRC Generations, and Games Workshop&#x27;s ultra-violent sports sim Blood Bowl III. We will also be hearing about several new Xbox accessories in development in Nacon&#x27;s hardware division, including the Daija Arcade Stick and the snazzy Pro Compact Colorlight controller.
Perhaps the most intriguing title on the lineup is RoboCop: Rogue City, which was first revealed during last summer&#x27;s Nacon Connect live stream. Developed by studio Teyon of Terminator: Resistance fame, we still know so little about Alex Murphy&#x27;s latest jaunt into the digital realm. Though RoboCop, as a franchise, seems custom-designed for video games, the brand has always struggled to truly recreate the cinematic excellence of Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s 1987 classic.
While Teyon&#x27;s Terminator title admittedly left something to be desired from a gameplay standpoint, it was clear that the studio does understand the potential buried within these enduring cinematic licenses. Fingers crossed that the developer will deliver the goods with RoboCop: Rogue City, and that we&#x27;ll see some promising gameplay footage today.
Join us on Destructoid this lunchtime and we can see what&#x27;s in store. You have 15 minutes to comply.

                              <span>The fine line between stupid and... and clever
In news spotted by GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation will be removing certain purchased content from certain user accounts next month, citing &quot;evolving licensing agreements with content providers.&quot;
The content in question belongs to movie publisher Studio Canal, whose titles will be removed from the German and Austrian versions of PSN on August 31. Not only will this render some 100 films unavailable for purchase, but users who have previously purchased the affected content will also be unable to access the films once this date passes. You can check out the full list of affected films here — remember, this (currently) only affects German and Austrian PlayStation users.
The Studio Canal situation is an inevitable part of PlayStation&#x27;s shuttering of PSN&#x27;s movie rental/purchase market. While the discontinuation of film purchases came into effect in the spring of 2021, the continuing &quot;rolling over&quot; of licenses suggests that Sony will be forced to come to terms of closure with each and every studio that has offered its film and TV properties for purchase. Clearly the agreement between PlayStation and Studio Canal has come to an end.
Of course, there are a lot of specificities here. We are, for now, only talking about purchased content involving one particular studio in two particular territories. But the prevailing concern is obviously focused more on the fact that publishers of any digital content — music, film, gaming, TV — have the essential right to remove and/or withhold access to any and all paid content at the drop of a hat. This may not be the last time such a story crops up in our headlines.

It&#x27;s time for another remaster, as the confusingly named Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series hits the Switch eShop on July 8. Note that this is actually a collection of two games: Klonoa and Klonoa 2, which debuted in 1997 on PS1 and 2001 on PS2 respectively. Amid some spinoffs and a Wii remake in 2008, the series has remained dormant until the 25th anniversary of Reverie this year. Time on Frog Island, which debuts on July 12 on the eShop, is the other big game Nintendo is highlighting this week.
The eShop is full of smaller games, though! We&#x27;re back in full force with 48 additional SKUs, which is actually around 50 if you account for a few things like the Little Nightmares bundle packing in two games, or the aforementioned releases. Expect our review of Klonoa Phanta…</span>

                              <span>Two massive event hosts join forces for E3&#x27;s comeback show
The Entertainment Software Association is set to host E3 again, and it&#x27;s partnering with ReedPop to make it happen. Today, the two announced that E3 2023 will be organized with ReedPop&#x27;s help.
ReedPop is the company behind PAX, New York Comic-Con, EGX, and the Star Wars Celebration. It&#x27;s also the parent company of several gaming sites. including GamesIndustry.biz and Eurogamer. (Disclosure: I was previously employed by ReedPop at USgamer.)
The duo plans to host E3 2023 in the Los Angeles Convention Center again, during the second week of June 2023.
https://twitter.com/E3/status/1545046476597956608
The event will host digital showcases and in-person components too, which will be open to consumers. Further details, like confirmed exhibitors, will be shared in the coming months.
&quot;It is a tremendous honor and privilege for ReedPop to take on the responsibility of bringing E3 back in 2023,&quot; said ReedPop president Lance Festerman. &quot;With the support and endorsement of the ESA, we&#x27;re going to build a world-class event to serve the global gaming industry in new and broader ways than we already do at ReedPop through our portfolio of world leading events and websites.&quot;
A new union
This partnership is wild, but also makes sense. E3 has fully called off two shows since the outbreak of COVID-19, in 2020 and 2022. And in 2021, the ESA hosted a digital-only event. PAX dealt with some called-off shows too, but has been returning to the convention space with events like PAX East 2022 and the upcoming PAX West.
Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley has been growing Summer Game Fest more each year. This year included both a stage show and an in-person event in Los Angeles. And, as the event republicized today, Summer Game Fest will be returning in June 2023 with both digital and in-person events. Looks like E3 will have some competition for its big return.

                              <span>They started with Dark Souls 3, and almost quit after the first boss
To quickly recap, shortly after the launch of Elden Ring, a legend was born among players. Their name is Let Me Solo Her: a user who logged in, fought the hardest boss in the game by themselves, and assisted others in getting a clear. They did it with such panache (the name, the outfit, the loadout, the tenacity) that they quickly became a meme (it&#x27;s gotten to the point where they even have cosplay fans [image is semi-NSFW]) and now, they&#x27;re being honored directly by the game&#x27;s publisher, Bandai Namco, for their 1000th kill.
Let Me Solo Her announced on Twitter that Bandai Namco US gifted them a special box with all sorts of goodies in it:
A personalized letter
Wood art of the boss they took down and famously soloed
A map of the game
A long sword with the phrase &quot;rise, tarnished&quot; on it
Note that this is the influencer bundle some folks got, but the personalized letter is unique. They didn&#x27;t just tweet out photos of their care package though: over on Twitter, Let Me Solo Her actually shares their Souls story too, and it&#x27;s pretty fascinating!
&quot;I can still remember my first experience with the soulsborne series and almost quitting because of Iudex Gundyr in Dark souls 3. I&#x27;m glad I persisted and went on to enjoy the game, because this community is one of the most passionate and dedicated people I&#x27;ve ever seen in a game, and I&#x27;m proud to be a part of it.&quot;

In retrospect, Dark Souls 3 is a pretty fantastic place to start, with a lot of quality-of-life upgrades that newcomers would find helpful. Once they get over that hump (whether it&#x27;s the first boss like Iudex Gundyr or the first few), they&#x27;re generally on their way.

                              <span>Xbox signs up for Europe&#x27;s biggest gaming event
Xbox has confirmed that it will be in attendance for Gamescom 2022, which is scheduled to take place in Germany next month. The industry giant is expected to offer up further information regarding its upcoming hardware and software plans, focusing on the next wave of releases for the Xbox Series X platform.
&quot;Following our recent Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase, we’re excited to confirm that Xbox will be back on the show floor at Gamescom 2022 in Cologne, Germany,&quot; wrote the company in this morning&#x27;s press release. &quot;Fans in Europe and around the world can expect updates on some announced games coming to Xbox in the next 12 months.&quot;
As noted, Gamescom 2022 will see the industry event return in a live capacity for the first time in two years, since the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forced the trade show to shift to an online model. Returning to its regular stomping ground of the Koelnmesse center in Cologne, Germany, Gamescom 2022 will offer attendees the opportunity to check out hundreds of upcoming releases on a multitude of platforms. Geoff Keighley will once again host an &quot;Opening Night Live&quot; stream to kick off the event.
While Xbox will be appearing on the show floor, both PlayStation and Nintendo have already confirmed that they will not be hosting booths at this year&#x27;s event. Since the pandemic shifted the balance of marketing mechanics, many publishers have chosen to highlight their products through their own channels, utilizing live streams and smaller, more localized events to demonstrate their upcoming releases.
Gamescom 2022 will take place in Cologne, Germany from August 24-28. You can find out more details about the hybrid event and its range of in-person and online activities over on the official website.

                              <span>I&#x27;m glad this series still lives on
If it wasn&#x27;t for the efforts of people like the folks behind Operation Rainfall, a lot of us may have never experienced the original Xenoblade Chronicles. Which, in turn, means we may have never played its sequels. Now there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;what ifs&quot; in there, as Nintendo and Monolith Soft could have collectively decided to localize the series at any point — but I&#x27;m happy that everything played out the way it has so far. That includes the road that led to Xenoblade Chronicles 3, which could end up becoming my favorite of the series.
[This article contains no major spoilers for the storyline, but you may want to go in completely blind.]

So we can&#x27;t talk about much at the moment (I&#x27;ll be brief!), but suffice to say I&#x27;m really pleased with what I&#x27;ve seen so fa…</span>

                              <span>A quick guide to Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo
Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo support is very straightforward — and as long as you have three total figures, you&#x27;ll get the most out of it.
Here&#x27;s a quick breakdown of how it all works.

You&#x27;ll scan amiibo via the main menu early into the game
Almost immediately after completing the tutorial story mission, you&#x27;ll be able to access the main menu. It&#x27;s here that you can pause the game, and head to the &quot;amiibo&quot; portion of the system screen.
It&#x27;s amazing that all these years on, there&#x27;s a specific &quot;amiibo&quot; menu option front and center. I love how Monolith Soft calls it a &quot;little reward.&quot; You get a little treat for buying all that plastic!

The main Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo is Shulk
As you may have seen via the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct, the sole core Xenoblade amiibo, Shulk, will unlock the biggest game-specific bit of content: the Monado sword skin.
Party members who are using the swordfighter class are able to use the skin. You can find it via the &quot;characters -&gt; clothing -&gt; attachments&quot; submenu, which you&#x27;ll unlock later in the game.

Other amiibo, when scanned in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, will provide random items
The rest of the amiibo support isn&#x27;t that exciting, which, as usual, is probably a good thing if you aren&#x27;t a fan of the figures.
Scanning other amiibo will grant random items in &quot;collectible sets.&quot; These are usually groups of reagents or ingredients, like the ones listed above, fresh off of a scan from our copy of the game. Once scanned, they&#x27;ll get dumped all over the ground, so you&#x27;ll need to quit the menu and pick them up with your player character.
Note that up to three amiibo can be scanned per day. And that&#x27;s it!

                              <span>Why yes, there *is* a Nintendo Switch version
As you might&#x27;ve seen in the summer gaming streams, there are too many frog games to keep track of this year (arguably a good problem to have!), but one of them, above all, is not leaving my sight. Frogun is a collectible-grabbing 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo 64 and PS1 era, and its protagonist, Renata, wields a frog that is also a &quot;gun.&quot;
It&#x27;s a genre close to my heart, with a cute style, and I&#x27;m all about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Uf2Mzf-GcZo
After making the wholesome rounds and recently sharing a demo on Steam, developer Molegato is now in the home stretch. Frogun will release on August 2, 2022, across Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. That&#x27;s... pretty soon!

                              <span>Lancarse&#x27;s tactical battler has a release date
It looks like The DioField Chronicle is just around the corner. The new RPG from Lancarse and Square Enix has a release date set for September 22, 2022.
The date was first shown during a livestream about The DioField Chronicle for Japan, with a date of September 22, 2022 but no mention if that included North America.
Store pages and pre-orders have been going up, however, with a Sept. 22 date set on the PlayStation Store, Xbox store, Steam, and Square Enix Store.
The DioField Chronicle is retailing for $59.99, though a Deluxe Edition can nab you some extras for $74.99. Or there&#x27;s the $169.99 Collector&#x27;s Edition set, which includes a full-on board game based on The DioField Chronicle. I do respect the creativity with this particular pack-in.

It was me, The DioField Chronicle
The DioField Chronicle is a new strategy RPG from Square Enix and Lancarse. It follows a band of mercenaries called Blue Fox, as war erupts around them.
It advertises a real-time battle system that utilizes strategy and decision-making about units&#x27; strengths and weaknesses.
Plus, it&#x27;s also got a diorama-style visual for battles that looks pretty great. It&#x27;s reminding me a bit of Triangle Strategy with its isometric view and shading.

The DioField Chronicle was first revealed during a Sony State of Play in March, alongside another Square Enix game Valkyrie Elysium. That new Valkyrie game has been locked in for a September 29 date for PlayStation platforms, with a PC launch coming later on November 11.
It looks like between those two games and the Crisis Core remaster, Square Enix has a good amount of games in store for the months ahead.

                              <span>Fall Guys proves it has legs
Fall Guys has been one of the most successful online games over the past few years, and for good reason. After the flood of battle royale games we got, it was a nice change of pace to have one that was a colorful, goofy platformer that we could play with friends. I know I certainly got swept up in it when it first came out, and had a blast trying something new even if I was terrible. Now, Fall Guys is seeing even more success, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier that a creative and genuinely fun idea is getting the love it deserves.
The official Fall Guys account tweeted this morning that the game has officially surpassed 50 million players! Exciting news for a game with such humble beginnings. If you&#x27;re wondering why the game is just now garnering such a big player base, it&#x27;s because Fall Guys just switched to a free-to-play model with battle passes and all that good stuff on June 21. The other significant change was that it moved off of Steam and onto the Epic Games Launcher, and was made available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch for the first time.
https://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1544698314242793473
After the rerelease, Fall Guys garnered 20 million players in 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive feat for a game that&#x27;s over two years old. Now it&#x27;s more than doubled that after two weeks.
If nothing else, this scenario has proved that the free-to-play model can be pretty effective at getting players to try a new game, and because the outfits are such a fun part of Fall Guys, the battle pass system should work well for them. Here&#x27;s hoping that the game continues to stick around for a while, because every time I see clips of it, it just makes me happy.
I guess now is a better time than any to jump back on the train, and try to claim a crown of my own once and for all.

                              <span>Fan-made game is available to download now.
Sonic Frontiers is well on its way to launch on Switch this coming Holiday 2022. Despite some mixed opinions toward the initial gameplay reveals via IGN during the month of June, reception was considerably more positive when Nintendo showcased the game during its Direct Mini: Partner Showcase just recently.
One thing for certain is that the game is a drastic departure from the Sonic games of yore, with &#x27;Open Zones&#x27; being the main hook and exploration taking more of a centre stage. It definitely got us wondering, just how would such a game translate into 2D? Could it actually be done?

The Switch is becoming the home of roguelites and roguelikes, and we have a really flashy, gorgeous pixel art game for you today that&#x27;s fast, frantic, and has had great reviews since it launched on Steam earlier this year.
Publisher PM Studios has announced that it&#x27;s bringing Team Suneat&#x27;s Blade Assault to the Switch on 30th September. This side-scrolling roguelite lets you slice through enemies like pixelated butter as you make your way through the sky city of Esperanza. There are seven bosses to defeat and over 200 different items to pick up on your runs.

The news that Portal: Companion Collection would shadow drop shortly after the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase made us nearly wee our pants with excitement. After all, Portal and Portal 2 are two of the finest games ever created, and we can now enjoy them either at home or on the go - wonderful!
In our review of the title, we said that &quot;if it weren&#x27;t for the frequent load screens punctuating the experience, we&#x27;d have absolutely nothing to complain about&quot; and gave the collection a solid 9/10.

TRAGsoft&#x27;s Pokémon-like RPG Coromon has a brand new release date of 21st July, publisher Freedom Games has announced. The game was originally due to be released on Switch back in March, but due to cross-platform multiplayer issues, the game was delayed on the console.
Coromon was meant to hit the Switch on the same day as the game&#x27;s Steam release, but the team needed time to work out the issues with multiplayer. Now, those are seemingly fixed and fans of monster-catching games can relax and they&#x27;ll have a brand new adventure to embark on in just two weeks time!

The original Live A Live is full of iconic music, and as the first project that Yoko Shimomura worked on after joining Square Enix, the soundtrack has cemented itself in video game history. That means the remake has some big shoes to fill, but from the trailers, it sounds like the music is going to be a dream.
To hype us up even more for the upcoming Live A Live remake&#x27;s music, producer (and director of the original) Takashi Tokita sat down with singer Hironobu Kageyama — who&#x27;s known for singing the openings to several shows such as Dragon Ball Z and various Sentai shows — to talk about one particularly iconic song, Go! Go! Buriki King!!, now called &#x27;Go! Go! Steel Titan!&#x27; Check out the original Super Famicom version over on YouTube right here.

                              <span>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was announced back in 2020 as a revival of the luxurious racing sim. Then 2021 brought a CG trailer and the exciting news that the game was set in Hong Kong. Now, in year three, we get the first real footage of the Solar Crown in action... for a few seconds... with stuff laid all over it...

In-between agonising jargon like &quot;narrative layers&quot; and &quot;high-level directives&quot;, there&#x27;s some neat concept art and info on what we can expect from the story, combat, and exploration.

So much so, I thought it was a homage to Bloodborne&#x27;s best bits. And at today&#x27;s Nacon Connect, developers Spiders unveiled a new trailer which shows ballerina-turned-bodyguard Aegis fight off some metallic monstrosities, mixed in with a bit of parkour. Seriously, I&#x27;m excited for this one.

Appeal Studios’ Gangs Of Sherwood is an upcoming third-person PvE co-op action game that puts you in the dainty shoes of the Merry Men. This time though, it’s set in a dystopian future instead of Ye Merry Olde England. Watch the announcement teaser below to see what you think of that.

He hops between some bushes, dodges a dragon, and chucks something at an orc - all the staples of a Hobbit who&#x27;s gone goblin mode. I&#x27;m still a bit on the fence about it, though.

Will you be able to play as Terminators? It&#x27;s not yet clear. Heck, it&#x27;s so early on the game doesn&#x27;t even have a proper name yet. Feel free to recoil in fear from the announcement teaser trailer below.

Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it&#x27;ll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.

                              <span>It&#x27;s fair to say that Skull And Bones has had a somewhat troubled development. Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.

                              <span>Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate &#x27;em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.
The current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there&#x27;s still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won&#x27;t catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that&#x27;s for sure.

From another angle, it makes total sense when you consider that the outcome of it all was info about BG3’s musically-tinged eighth patch, arriving later today. We’re finally getting those gnome bards, fam. You can check out the stream for yourselves below.

The third unusual thing is one I didn&#x27;t even appreciate until I was a fair bit in: it&#x27;s not only a good strategy game &quot;for an RPG Maker game&quot;, but one of the best games I&#x27;ve played this year.

The massive 2TB model is now going for $221, down from $260, which is the lowest price we can find on a ~7000MB/s NVMe SSD of this capacity.

                              <span>Come with us now on a journey to our childhoods, as we on the Electronic Wireless Show podcast talk about the games that make us feel the most nostalgic. The games we played as kids, or spent all-nighters on as teens.

However, he also states the notice provides no clarification from Take-Two about how he&#x27;s actually breaching their copyright.

Foam Sword&#x27;s 2019 game evokes childhood joys of zooming around with your pal and tricking out your bicycle with reflectors and Spokey Dokeys.

                              <span>From the recent setup of the MSI Alder Lake motherboard flashed with Dasharo/Coreboot I had an extra LGA-1700 motherboard around. With some Phoronix readers in the past having inquired about more Alder Lake benchmarks on the low-end, I picked up a Core i3 12100 processor that features four performance cores / eight threads. For those curious about the CPU performance and that of the integrated UHD Graphics 730, here are some Ubuntu Linux performance benchmarks with the i3-12100 and other similar processors.</span>

Sing your favorite pirate sea shanty at the top of your lungs! If you don&#x27;t know any pirate sea shanties, make one up. We have reason to celebrate: Ubisoft&#x27;s Skull and Bones launches on November 8 and looks quite good. News of the game&#x27;s resurrection (after a long delay) came today in a 20-minute Ubisoft Forward livestream that included a brief look at stunning new gameplay footage.

                              <span>The PlayStation Twitter account posted a small batch of announcements highlighting upcoming indie games headed to PlayStation. While Cult of the Lamb&#x27;s impending August 11 release was already confirmed, a few noteworthy reveals and updates should have indie fans on PlayStation excited for the near future and beyond. Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of the games making their way to PS5 and PS4.

One of the best and most surprising games of 2021 makes its way to consoles for the first time.

                              <span>Supermassive Games has released a new story trailer for The Devil In Me, the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology. 
The Devil In Me was revealed last October, and it will be the finale to Season One of The Dark Pictures Anthology. It stars Jessie Buckley, who you can see in today&#x27;s new trailer, and seems to feature many horror elements that lean on the Saw franchise. There are fatal booby traps, maze-like halls, shifting walls, and more. Whatever this house in The Devil In Me is, one thing is for sure: it&#x27;s a house of horrors inspired by the infamous hotel of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

Now, the two have teamed up once more to give Lego fans the largest Super Mario build yet, and it’s the most infamous villain in the entire Mushroom Kingdom: Bowser. 
Revealed today, this is the biggest Lego Bowser to date, according to Lego, clocking in at 2807 pieces. Dubbed Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser, this build is a “highly detailed recreation of the King of the Koopas, complete with controllable movements and the ability to launch a fireball, reflective of Bowser’s huge and powerful features.” 

This set is notable for Lego, too, because it utilizes newly-created Lego elements to recreate the look of Bowser’s iconic back spikes. Plus, it featur…</span>

                              <span>Japanese artist Kazuki Takahashi, the creator behind the mega-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, has died at 60. 
This news comes from reports from Japanese public broadcaster NHK, as reported by IGN. According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. 
Takahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel.

                              <span>The CMA is looking into whether this deal is anti-competitive
The Competition and Markets Authority is looking into Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The UK regulator is officially looking into whether the deal could be anti-competitive.
September 1 is the deadline for the first phase of the investigation. In this phase, the CMA will determine whether Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Blizzard deal could harm competition, and if it should launch an in-depth investigation. It&#x27;s also inviting comments on the transaction from any interested party.
&quot;As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers—for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice,&quot; the CMA said (via GamesIndustry.biz).
Microsoft corporate VP and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said (via CNBC) that regulatory scrutiny of the deal was to be expected. Microsoft will &quot;fully cooperate&quot; with the CMA.
&quot;We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,&quot; said Tanzi. She also added that Microsoft remains &quot;confident&quot; the deal will close in fiscal year 2023.

A massive merger
The scrutiny isn&#x27;t a surprise, especially with a deal as big as Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard. The CMA in the UK is not the only one looking into it, either. The FTC is also investigating the deal, as chair Lina Khan told lawmakers in June. The FTC&#x27;s investigation will look at, among other things, how the deal would impact workers at Activision Blizzard.
The $68.7 billion deal was announced in January, and made a lot of waves. With a portfolio of games including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, Warcraft, and much more, it could be a huge deal for Microsoft once the ink dries.

The Games Done Quick (GDQ) team has announced that it has rescinded a World Record run that took place during last week&#x27;s Summer Games Done Quick 2022 event. The run, which featured hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash actioner Metal Gear Solid: Revengeance, has been nullified after the SGDQ runner admitted to using footage spliced together from previous offline attempts.
While most of the event&#x27;s speedruns were showcased on-site, a small handful were held in an online capacity for logistical reasons. A Russian speedrunner tackled Revengeance&#x27; &quot;Blade Wolf&quot; DLC as part of a viewer donation bonus incentive, and proceeded to achieve a world-best clear time in the process. However, the player has since confessed to having faked the feat by simply playing an edited, pre-re…</span>

Guerrilla Games is still refining Horizon Forbidden West, and with the latest update, the studio has added something that&#x27;ll make a certain group of PS5 owners very happy: Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and High Refresh Rate (HFR) support, including a &quot;Balanced&quot; 40Hz graphics mode. If you&#x27;ve got a supported 120Hz display, you&#x27;re in luck.

Aside from a short trailer, the developers shared the 1.17 patch notes on Reddit:
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and High Refresh Rate (HFR) support
VRR improves dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz
VRR &amp; HFR targets a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz
New “Balanced” Graphics Mode introducing 40Hz for supported displays

The court initially dismissed the case, ruling that it didn&#x27;t have jurisdiction over the foreign defendants. However, a recent order from the appeals court in a separate piracy lawsuit changed that.

                              <span>Following a scant seven months of availability, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will be leaving digital console storefronts on July 9. 
According to the Matrix Awakens website, those who add the tech demo to their library on PlayStation 5 and/or Xbox Series X will still be able to launch and mess around with the experience after the delisting date. Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: 
The Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.
You can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.</span>

Lenneth is the 2006 enhanced PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile, which first arrived in North America in 2000. Lenneth came to mobile devices in 2018 but it hasn’t been available on a home console since the original version arrived on PS1. 
Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth comes to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29, the same day that Valkyrie Elysium launches. It will be sold separately for a yet-to-be-announced price. You can also get it as part of the $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition of Valkyrie Elysium.</span>

                              <span>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. 
CD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. 
Announced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. 
“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” 
IGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out.

                              <span>Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.
The new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. 


Square Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. 
Don&#x27;t worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. 
Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. 
Valkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.</span>

                              <span>Forspoken, Square Enix’s upcoming action RPG, will no longer launch in October and has been pushed to January 24.
In a post on the game’s Twitter page, developer Luminous Productions, a team made up of Final Fantasy XV developers, states that Forspoken is largely complete and is in the final polishing phase. It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. 
Forspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. 
Forspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.</span>

As you might expect, both editions of Ragnarok look fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that both come in a fancy Knowledge Keeper&#x27;s Shrine box that features beautiful artwork and plenty of fun goodies inside. Check them both out for yourself in the trailer below:

                              <span>PlayStation and Sony Santa Monica Studio have released a brand new God of War: Ragnarok trailer, revealing that the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2018&#x27;s God of War will be released this November. 
More specifically, Ragnarok will hit PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, meaning we&#x27;re less than five months away from playing the game. The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. 
Check out the cinematic &quot;Father and Son&quot; trailer for yourself below: 


Fans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won&#x27;t spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok&#x27;s take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don&#x27;t have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.</span>

                              <span>Guerrilla Games and PlayStation have been steady at work, making Horizon Forbidden West an even better game than it was at launch with updates that add transmog, fix visual shimmering, improve graphics, and more. Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. 
More specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. 


The game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…</span>

                              <span>Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita&#x27;s original vision of Live a Live, we&#x27;re getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.
I recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it&#x27;s brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:
Seven Distinct Stories
A Fun Assortment of Characters
Adult Language and Humor?
Excellent Writing
Combat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?


It&#x27;s Beautiful
The 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don&#x27;t offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.</span>

We&#x27;re doing difficult work here. This week, it&#x27;s a question of a helping hand when you&#x27;re stuck versus something so unsubtle that it&#x27;ll take your face off and you&#x27;ll be glad for it and even be miffed if it doesn&#x27;t happen. What&#x27;s better: hints, or explosive barrels?

                              <span>Mythological mash-up action RPG Valkyrie Elysium will hit PC on November 11th, Square Enix have announced, six weeks after its initial release on current-gen PlayStations. Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.

Not only that, but the fantasy roguelike deckbuilder will be out tomorrow, July 7th.

                              <span>You might recall that not too long ago, I hit the Elden Ring exhaustion point. Pre-heating the oven and a rigorous badminton schedule didn&#x27;t mingle too well with an open world that demanded every ounce of my concentration. I went MIA from the Lands Between for three months, spending my time watching cushy reality TV like Below Deck Mediterranean and lying in my bed, hoping its springs would somehow channel electricity into my bones and recharge my weary mind.
Over the past few days I&#x27;ve returned to the Lands Between with renewed vigor. I&#x27;ve taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn&#x27;t stop for even a second. In doing everything it takes to finish this game before I burn out again, I&#x27;ve learned the importance of investment and why spending is good, actually.

It was due out on 11th October later this year, but has now been pushed back to the 24th January 2023. They say it just needs a bit more polishing up before it arrives, which is fine by me. I mean, no point rushing something out before it&#x27;s ready is there?

The game’s co-writer, Guardians Of The Galaxy and The Suicide Squad director James Gunn, isn’t returning either. You can kind of understand Gunn not being involved, considering the game’s already been written.

                              <span>Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That&#x27;s the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn&#x27;t good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don&#x27;t need to mention ever again.
Replaying it now is a different experience. It&#x27;s still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there&#x27;s a whole section that&#x27;s such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there&#x27;s a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I&#x27;m not alone in thinking so, &#x27;cos in 2009 this was RPS&#x27;s Game Of The Year. Can&#x27;t blame me for that. I didn&#x27;t even work here then.

                              <span>In the 100 or so hours I&#x27;ve spent playing Death Stranding in the last couple of years, I&#x27;ve often wondered about the state of Sam Bridges&#x27; limbs. Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I&#x27;m not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold&#x27;s new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that&#x27;s right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it&#x27;s quite possibly the strangest game you&#x27;ll play all year.

                              <span>It’s not usually good news when an emperor decides to directly involve themselves in your business, but sci-fi 4X RTS Dune: Spice Wars certainly thinks it is. House Corrino will be landing their Sardaukar warriors on the desert planet of Arrakis this summer to challenge the Atreides, Harkonnens, Smugglers and Fremen as part of the game’s next major update. The new playable faction is the second of Spice Wars’ Early Access roadmap milestones.

                              <span>This week, far too much of my brainspace has been occupied by the JiuShark M.2-Three: a tower-style cooler for NVMe SSDs that’s just launched in China. Honestly, look at it. For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.


Except, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.

Well, let’s have a quick refresher of what else happened in 2002 for some perspective: Queen’s Golden Jubilee, check, last confirmed sighting of the Yangtze river dolphin, righto, SARS starts spreading… okay, let’s just stick to tipping our hats at one of Poland’s best known games developers for now. You can start doing that when the CDPR 20th anniversary livestream kicks off at 3pm BST/4pm CEST/7am PDT today.

This six-core twelve-thread chip is a solid upgrade over the likes of the Ryzen 5 3600 from the previous generation, but mostly makes sense in a new budget gaming build or as an upgrade for an older Ryzen 1000 or Ryzen 2000 system.

                              <span>The bombastic hack-and-slasher Lollipop Chainsaw is making a return, ten years after the original’s release. Yoshimi Yasuda, former CEO of Kadokawa Games (the original publishers of Lollipop Chainsaw) vaguely teased the game&#x27;s return last month during its 10-year anniversary, but it&#x27;s now been confirmed that the remake is definitely happening and that Yusada will be returning to the series alongside his new studio, Dragami Games.
If you never had the pleasure of playing Lollipop Chainsaw, watch the trailer below for a taste of the chaos.

                              <span>In the dead of night I&#x27;ve been hearing things. At first, I thought it was the neighbours next door enjoying a bit of karaoke. Maybe some twigs banging off a discarded Tesco trolley, creating a beautiful tune. No, I&#x27;m convinced it was the dulcet tones of Kiryu singing &quot;Dame da ne dame yo dame na no yo!&quot;, as a signal from the nether that Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami, and Yakuza Kiwami 2 would be back on Game Pass having been removed last year. And by God, they&#x27;re there! They&#x27;re live! That&#x27;s rad!

                              <span>The most prolific indie studio of the last decade are preparing to bow out, with today bringing the early access launch of &quot;the last game from Zachtronics&quot;, Last Call BBS. It&#x27;s a puzzle-o-rama firing up a mysterious old computer to download pirated software from a BBS, letting us play everything from logic puzzles of circuits and flesh to a model kit-building simulation. I&#x27;ve played a wee bit and am keen to explore more, even as someone who is the absolute worst at Zachlikes.

                              <span>Anyone who&#x27;s played one of Firaxis&#x27; XCOM games in the last ten years will have a story about missed shots. Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they&#x27;re an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis&#x27; creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  
&quot;It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder,&quot; he says.

As a modern revamp of an 18-year-old Half-Life mod by the same name, it&#x27;s an FPS where bullets are spheres of snow and guns are human arms... and snowball-launching crossbows. Not to mention it&#x27;s set in the 80&#x27;s with a synthwave backing track. I&#x27;m sold.

                              <span>Liam and I thought Overwatch 2&#x27;s first PVP beta was fine! It was just hard to say just how much of that came down to the &quot;2&quot; in its title. We jumped back into its ongoing second beta, in the hopes that we&#x27;d finally wrap our heads around the game. Maybe we&#x27;d got it all wrong the first time around? It&#x27;s the sequel to the biggest hero shooter out there! This time, this time we&#x27;d feel the &quot;2&quot; part come alive beneath our fingertips as we insta-locked Torbjorn on attack.
Dear reader, Liam and I emerged from our Overwatch 2 session having had a marvellous chat. We caught up on life, talked about Monster Hunter Rise, and how nice it is that the RPS Treehouse is complete again. Everything except Overwatch 2 itself was discussed... Which says it all, really.

                              <span>I like anime, but I possibly like anime intros even more. At their best they&#x27;re a rush of style and energy, they often feature better animation than the show that follows, and they are regularly scored by first rate Japanese jazz, rock or blues tracks. 

Netflix just posted the intro to the upcoming Cyberpunk anime, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and it&#x27;s got a Franz Ferdinand track over the top - but hey, it&#x27;s still pretty good.

                              <span>Capcom recently announced a 10-game Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection, bundling together the six Game Boy Advance Battle Network titles and the various versions that were originally released. I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam. It’s great to see these classic games on modern platforms, and I hope other companies take note of the preservation strategy Capcom has taken …</span>

                              <span>Skull and Bones, Ubisoft&#x27;s long-delayed pirate multiplayer game, rises from the depths of the sea on Thursday during a livestream presentation. Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.
Ubisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don&#x27;t know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft&#x27;s blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here&#x27;s hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.
Until then, are you excited for Skull &amp; Bones? Were you a fan of Ubisoft&#x27;s pirate-focused Assassins&#x27; Creed: Black Flag? Let us know in the comments below!</span>

During an Indie World Showcase last December, Nintendo highlighted Endling: Extinction is Forever, and I was immediately intrigued by the premise. It&#x27;s attempting to tackle the issue of deforestation and climate change sorrowfully. 
Endling begins with a terrifying look at the destruction of nature at the hands of humans. You control one of the last foxes on Earth, and you must escape a forest – presumably your home – being ravaged by a fire. Shortly after finding a new lair, it turns out you have a pack of cubs to care for. Doing so requires you to feed and nurture the…</span>

This buddy is either rusty or has never played it, but that&#x27;s okay; they just want to have a good time throwing hands. To accommodate them, you purposely assume a weaker form, unleashing only 5 percent of your true power to avoid obliterating them while they haplessly button-mash in a futile attempt to stay competitive. 
Laughs can be had but holding back so much isn&#x27;t necessarily fun because you want to go full force. If you&#x27;re in that friend&#x27;s shoes, you wish you could play more competently much quicker to avoid feeling inferior and babysat. As a fighting game fan, I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this situation, and neither is ideal. That&#x27;s why Street Fighter 6&#x27;s Modern …</span>

He touched briefly on his upcoming projects (yes, plural projects) and was happy to report that the game likely to come out first – Haunted Chocolatier – is a solo endeavor. Despite the lack of specifics, I was thrilled to hear the indie creator’s next project was in the works.
Then he surprised everyone. Barone publicly shared early Haunted Chocolatier gameplay footage, and it looked incredible. The art style immediately evoked Barone’s first title, though the developer made it clear fans shouldn’t expect the same experience.

Black Forest Games&#x27; remake of Destroy All Humans 2: Reprobed is getting couch co-op. That&#x27;s right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.
Reprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector&#x27;s edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.
The remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said &quot;The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.&quot; The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let&#x27;s hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I&#x27;d love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.

Komentuje to jednoduše: situace s X11 se nijak nelepší a Wayland je již široce podporován. Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.</span>

I trawled through archives of official sites hoping to discover that the marketing department had released it as a wallpaper or something, to no avail. But I did find a load of other official Deus Ex wallpapers which are so delightfully turn-of-the-millenium. Scanlines! Lensflare! Photoshop Difference Clouds filters! Come, admire, enjoy.

The Worthy Of Better, Stronger Together bundle is organised by streamer and musician Abbey ‘Scruncho’ Smith of horror game publisher Dread XP, and features 169 games. Picking up the bundle aids the National Organization For Women and the Center For Reproductive Rights in equal measure.

I can confirm it&#x27;s really good! A lovely point and click mystery with some tricksy puzzles, but unlimited goes so you still get to feel clever - plus the story plays with some mystery tropes in really fun ways. But the real joy is its characters. It&#x27;s a cast of suspects that are both wacky and relatable, and I love them.

Sega’s decision comes in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of the Roe v. Wade ruling last month, which had enshrined abortion rights at a federal level for almost half a century.

The company wanted to gather a group of experienced but still-passionate developers, all focused on the idea of creating something ambitious despite the studio’s smaller size. The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.

Like Hyrule Warriors, which received a Breath of the Wild-specific sequel in Age of Calamity, this new Warriors game is set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe. Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review. 
I interviewed Nintendo Co. Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve seen sequels rise above and plummet below their precursors. Months ago, I said Overwatch 2 was a redemption arc. And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I&#x27;ve gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls.

                              <span>You wouldn’t guess it from his child-like appearance, but gaming’s much-loved spherical hero turned 30 this year. Kicking off his first adventure in 1992, Kirby has grown into a juggernaut in the game industry, starring in dozens of titles and making appearances in countless others. The long-running franchise is among video games’ best-selling. One of its most successful titles, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, released in March 2022. It’s not only breaking series records but also sucked in a whole new generation of fans. To celebrate the formidable gumball’s third decade in the industry, we’re looking back at the franchise, from how it started to where it’s floating now.

It appears that Cloudflare drew a very clear line in the sand and refused to step over it.

The fan version was removed from the store a little over a week ago when Nightdive Studios released their own Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition, then swiftly bundled together with that remaster when people complained.

However, Miramax now argues that the movie director&#x27;s &#x27;limited rights&#x27; only apply to print publications and not NFTs.

Two leaders of the network received 44-month prison sentences and the other five were ordered to serve between 9 to 18 months. After the defendants gave up around one million euros of the amount they generated from the fraud, a court suspended their custodial sentences.

                              <span>Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.
The first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.
Check it out in action: 


As you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. 
Unhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. 
And there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11.

                              <span>We’ll be playing matches in Overwatch 2’s second beta today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central. Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?
Overwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. 
We’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe. You’ll have to tune in and see what happens!

                              <span>Microsoft, the company that brought us furry Sonic controllers and a Far Cry 6 console that resembled a bomb, has unveiled its latest kooky Xbox Series X sweepstakes, and it may be the coolest/dumbest one yet.
Hot on the heels of the premier of Thor: Love and Thunder on July 8, the company is giving away a custom Series X modeled after Thor’s trusty hammer, Mjölnir. That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It&#x27;s hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. 
The contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.</span>

                              <span>Sucker Punch Productions, the studio behind 2020’s hit new IP Ghost of Tsushima, has revealed it is not working on anything related to its previous Infamous and Sly Cooper franchises. The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. 
This news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima. In this blog post, though, the studio clarifies some things amidst rumors of a Sly Cooper 5 and an Infamous remake.

What began as a library of just 20 NES games has grown to include dozens more. Plus, Nintendo has since introduced SNES, Nintendo 64, and even Sega Genesis games, giving players a chance to play some fan-favorite classics and some deep cuts, too. It’s hard to predict when new games might arrive as the company has maintained a somewhat inconsistent cadence in doing so, but that’s okay because this list is all you need. 
As Nintendo adds new titles, we’ll be sure to update this list to include them. If you’re looking for something specific, use this story’s Table of Contents to jump to the different consoles quickly. Here’s every NES, SNES, 64, and Genesis game added …</span>

Across three weeks, 176 cyclists will ride 3328 kilometres (2068 miles) winding through France, Denmark, Belgium, and Switzerland, including the Alps and Pyrenees. As a keen cyclist and avid Tour watcher myself, I&#x27;m excited. So in celebration, over the coming weeks I&#x27;ll be gabbing about the Tour De France, cycling, and bikes in a wide variety of video games with my own Tour De Jeux, from big-budget open-world extravaganzas to cute wee indie adventures. Let&#x27;s start in the obvious place: the official Tour De France video game.

I&#x27;ve nothing against 2D platformers, but to stand out in such a saturated genre you really need to capture something special. Wonder Potion have more or less nailed both the tricky but rewarding platforming, grappling, and baddie smacking parts of their formula, and perhaps more impressively, the story parts as well. This is a game with character, and the storytelling chops to make the most of its relatively simple ideas.

                              <span>While I’ve been down in the hardware mines, searching for the best early Amazon Prime Day deals and choking on consumer advice fumes, Graham has been working on how to make this list a little more colourful and readable. Behold, then, our new-look guide to saving some cash on your next component or peripheral upgrade – even before Prime Day 2022 itself, which will run July 12th-13th.
What’s more, you won’t need an Amazon Prime account for any of these, unlike most of the big deals that launch on the 12th. Amazon’s Prime Day landing page might already point to various bits of discounted PC hardware but you won’t be limited to the big A alone, as plenty of rival retailers will be running their own, competing sales. I&#x27;ve included some of the best early non-Amazon deals right here, and I’ll eventually post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide for those who’d rather avoid Amazon entirely.

                              <span>The arrival of Monster Hunter Rise&#x27;s Sunbreak expansion has brought a swathe of quality of life improvements to Capcom&#x27;s beast-bashing action game, including support for Nvidia&#x27;s performance-boosting DLSS tech. Announced earlier this week as part of the game&#x27;s 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone&#x27;s hair / fur. And in a game about felling all manner of feathery, scaly lizard animals, that&#x27;s not exactly ideal.

Some upcoming video games are planning to examine the motives behind these enigmatic creatures, whose origins remain unknown. Stray will put you in the paws of a street cat finding their way home in a cyberpunk city. Little Kitty Big City will see you wearing the whiskers of a cat less concerned with going home than it is with wreaking urban havoc. But what if you don&#x27;t want to wait for these games? Well, you have options. Here are 10 of the best cats in PC games.

                              <span>Back in April, Ed advocated that more games should adopt anime-style openers. I come to you today with another proposal. In addition to, or perhaps instead of, anime openers, I put it to you that more games should celebrate their launch days with live action music videos - and after watching Capcom&#x27;s freshly unveiled &quot;Matsuken Sunbreak&quot; vid for Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, I think you&#x27;ll heartily agree.

                              <span>Get your knee and elbow pads ready, EA have finally rolled out some more information about its upcoming open-world skateboarding game, Skate. This is the first bit of news we&#x27;ve had since last year&#x27;s incredibly brief announcement and it’s in the form of a shin-shredding “pre-pre-pre-alpha” gameplay trailer.

                              <span>Adapting an established property in any medium has got to be a pretty tricky proposition. Satisfying the long term fans while keeping things approachable for newcomers on top of, well, making a good game. Add in the complexities of making a turn-based game based on an existing turn-based game and it’s surprising that developers don’t just collapse into gibbering, tentacle-waving Chaos Spawn.


Complex Games, the developers of recent XCOM-like Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters not only managed to resist the mutating power of the Warp, but produced an absolute cracker of a game. Suspecting pacts with Dark Powers were behind it, I put on my big Inquisitorial hat and set off to question Noah Decter-Jackson, the game’s Creative Director.

                              <span>It turns out that school won&#x27;t be out for summer this year, because The Sims 4&#x27;s next expansion pack High School Years is set to release on July 28th. The first full expansion since Cottage Living launched a year ago, High School Years is set to do exactly what it says on the tin, massively expanding gameplay options for Sims in their teens.
The pack promises to introduce staples of high school life like attending classes, getting detention, going to prom, and graduating, all as on-screen activities that the player can guide their Sims through. While there&#x27;s a fair bit of overlap with the series&#x27; established college-themed expansion packs like The Sims 4 Discover University, giving this treatment to high school-aged characters is a franchise first, and something that&#x27;s been on the fandom&#x27;s collective wish list for a very long time.

                              <span>Sea of Stars, the promising-looking retro RPG from the team behind The Messenger, is the latest title to get pushed out of 2022. 
Developer Sabotage posted a message on Twitter stating it simply wants to polish up the adventure as much as possible without crunching its staff.
While the delay is a bummer, we appreciate the team’s respect for the employee’s work/life balance and strive for quality. The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. 
The game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.</span>

                              <span>Every so often, a game development studio comes up with an idea so good other developers insert it into their games. In Pow Wow Entertainment&#x27;s newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I&#x27;m hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game&#x27;s first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack&#x27;s thrusters.
Stuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don&#x27;t have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a &quot;punker granny&quot; or a &quot;famous streamer&quot; with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.
Stuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it&#x27;s difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.</span>

                              <span>As previously promised, Halo Infinite’s long-awaited campaign co-op takes its first steps towards launch, thanks to a network beta flight scheduled for July.  
Much like the multiplayer beta that proceeded Infinite’s launch last fall, this co-op beta, which runs July 11 to July 22, allows registered players to tackle the entire campaign alongside a buddy to ensure everything works as planned for the full rollout. Because this is a new campaign build that players must download, 343 states that no previous story progress carries over, so players will be starting from scratch. Progress made during the beta will also not transfer back to the retail version. 
In a Halo Waypoint blog post, 343 lead software engineer Isaac Bender and lead world designer John Mulkey discussed the co-op mode’s feat…</span>

                              <span>You&#x27;ll soon have the chance to play EA&#x27;s highly anticipated Skate sequel, but not in the way you would expect. Developer Full Circle and publisher Electronic Arts are looking for players who want to playtest the game and provide feedback on its development. You can sign up for this &quot;insider&quot; program here. As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.
If you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title &quot;Still working on it.&quot; The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series&#x27; skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.
Regardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us. Skate is alsmost back and it looks like it&#x27;s going to be a blast.</span>

Cuphead’s long-awaited and aptly named The Delicious Last Course serves up a wonderful final dish that acts more like a satisfying dessert than a full second helping. Though not long, it offers an enjoyable batch of devilish boss battles and a welcomed addition in the now playable Ms. Chalice.
Ms. Chalice sports a unique moveset such as a double-jump, a dodge roll that can safely bypass hazards, and even one extra health point. She’s a blast to use, and I loved taking advantage of her added maneuverability. Does she make…</span>

                              <span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is getting an expansion called Trials of the Dragon King. The DLC includes new gear, jobs, and enemies to fight. Check out the short trailer below; it&#x27;s as deliciously chaotic as you&#x27;d expect. 
There was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.

In Stranger of Paradise fashion, it&#x27;s hard to parse through what&#x27;s happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, &quot;You will die here, and I will live forever.&quot; We&#x27;re sure Jack will make him eat his words. 
Stranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, &quot;Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that&#x27;s a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it&#x27;s all about combat and little else.&quot;
Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin&#x27;s first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time (PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4)
The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan (PlayStation 4)

                              <span>Round two of the Overwatch 2 beta is finally here, but what can fans look forward to with this latest tech test? Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title&#x27;s latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.
coverage here.



The Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn&#x27;t have the power of Roadhog&#x27;s but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.
On top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we&#x27;re also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You&#x27;ll just have to watch for yourself to find out!</span>

                              <span>After obtaining the broadest injunction ever seen in a US streaming piracy lawsuit, several media companies argued that Cloudflare should be held in contempt of court for non-compliance. Negotiations are now underway to end this dispute but it appears that can only be achieved if the court agrees to modify the injunction, which was previously described as a &quot;power grab&quot;.

                              <span>Let’s face facts: the old Sonic games have been re-released more times than I’ve had hot dinners. And every single Sonic fan has bought every single one of them, such is our sheer madness. We’re a little spoiled on PC for Sonic content these days, with every recent game of note having its own PC port that’s immediately been modded from bottom to breakfast. But it wasn’t always this simple, oh no. It used to be pretty slim pickings for us Sonicsters, and I’m here to tell you what we fought through to get to the promised land of ports we bask in today.

Dubbed &#x27;W3itch.io&#x27;, the copycat site&#x27;s creator replied to a tweet from Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran, who promptly asked them not to &quot;rip off&quot; Itch.io anymore. W3itch.io even described itself as a “free-as-freedom open marketplace for independent game creators inspired by Itch and Gitcoin”. Not the most sensible of ideas to engage with the person whose work you’re replicating, W3itch.io.

Hailing from designer Terry Cavanagh, the DLC gives each of the base game’s six contestants an episode with “wildly new designs and rules”, the devs say. Play through all the episodes and you should get another 4 to 5 hours out of the game.

                              <span>A few years back, Pip enjoyed Hook, a minimalist puzzle game about untangling mish-mashes of hooks and pins by removing pieces in the correct order. If you try to remove that one, the hook will snag on that pin, so first this pin needs to go but ah! that goes through the middle of this ring, so... it&#x27;s interesting to understand a shape and system so you can pull it to pieces. Now a sequel is out, and it&#x27;s also nice, and it&#x27;s under £2, and it has a demo too.

                              <span>Back in 2020, a group of digital art smugglers lifted the National Gallery’s entire art collection, nabbing each of the 2,400 hi-res digital artworks straight from the institution’s website. Since the collection is made up of paintings long past their copyright expiration, countless works by Van Gogh, Da Vinci, Titian, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and the rest were all legally (technically) snatched up in what could have well been the biggest digital heist in art history.
The cheeky looters in question were StikiPixels, the very same team behind the art gallery sim Occupy White Walls, and now anyone who owns a PC and a copy of the game can hang these priceless paintings in their own private virtual collections. In OWW (officially pronounced Owouawwouaw if you have the time), you can build your own architecturally ambitious gallery and stuff it full of artwork.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I&#x27;ve started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I&#x27;ve played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you&#x27;ll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it&#x27;s done ours. I&#x27;ll warn you now, though. It&#x27;s a big list.

                              <span>Video game parodies are often ropey, being neither funny nor fun to play. I am delighted that The Looker is both, and free too. It&#x27;s a loving send-up of The Witness, inviting us to a strange island to solve more line-drawing puzzles and listen to more audio tapes. Some of the puzzles are quite clever, and many of the jokes made me laugh—plus it&#x27;s only an hour or two to complete.

There&#x27;s also a new island with mountains, icy tundra and desert to navigate. Watch the trailer below, although it’s getting on a bit now.

                              <span>It wasn&#x27;t until I played a hands-on preview of Cult Of The Lamb this weekend that I realised how much ovine imagery is knocking around Christianity. All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.

                              <span>Steam Deck production might be ramping up again but it turns out more recent orders could be something of a lucky dip, SSD-wise. Valve have quietly updated their Steam Deck tech specs page with a note that the NVMe SSDs in “some” 256GB and 512GB models might now use the PCIe Gen 3.0 x2 interface, meaning the drive has half the usual bandwidth of the Gen 3.0 x 4 SSDs that previously featured as standard.
As first spotted by German site HardwareLuxx, there&#x27;s no indication as to why Valve made this change, and it doesn’t look like anyone with an outstanding Steam Deck order will know which SSD bandwidth they’ll get in advance. However, Valve&#x27;s added note explains that “In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4.”

We learn about how they&#x27;re pulling inspiration from the worlds of Final Fight and Third Strike, why Modern Control Type &quot;is not an &#x27;Easy Mode&#x27;&quot; and should be used in tournament play, and finally, how the team is learning from Street Fighter 5&#x27;s mistakes to ensure a vibrant future for the series.</span>

                              <span>Monster Rancher was revived late last year with the release of the Monster Ranger 1&amp;2 DX collection, and Bandai Namco isn&#x27;t going to stop there. In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!


The first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, &quot;How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?&quot; To which I responded, &quot;Yes, please. I&#x27;d very much like that. Give it to me now.&quot; Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You&#x27;ll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you&#x27;ll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.
We&#x27;re not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it&#x27;s slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.</span>

2017&#x27;s Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle pleasantly surprised players by deftly combining two very different universes and utilizing the unexpected template of a turn-based tactics game. Five years later, a sequel, Sparks of Hope, launches on October 20 and builds upon the winning formula while also shaking up the foundation to make it more than a retread.
Speaking to the game&#x27;s associate producer Christina Nava, Ubisoft was pleased as punch at Kingdom Battle&#x27;s success and how it entertained turn-based strategy fans and non-fans alike. 
&quot;We were particularly happy by the fact that we saw many players who were not …</span>

                              <span>Tri-Ace and Square Enix have largely kept quiet about Star Ocean The Divine Force since its reveal last fall, but that changed in a big way today. In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game&#x27;s narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. 
The Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what&#x27;s to come in the sci-fi action RPG. 


The second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean&#x27;s characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  


Lastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond&#x27;s campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. 


Tri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</span>

More specifically, Fallen Angel will hit Switch on July 19, meaning there’s already less than a month left until you can take the archangel experience with you on the go. If you aren’t familiar with Fallen Angel, you can get a look at what awaits you in it in the special Switch announcement trailer below: 


As you can see in the trailer above, there are a lot of hellacious things going on, which makes sense considering you control Lucifer as he attempts to ascend from hell to get revenge on those who banished him from heaven.
