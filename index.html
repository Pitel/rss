                    <span>I’ve lost count of the amount of Neon Genesis Evangelion cosplay I’ve posted on this site over the last 10 years, but pretty much all of it has been focused on the anime’s characters, especially Rei and Asuka. It’s enormous mechs are a somewhat trickier proposition.

                    <span>Antstream Arcade is now available on the Epic Games Store, boasting over 1000 games to stream to your PC. We learned of its inclusion in the launcher through a story from the folks over at PC Gamer.
The streaming service has all kinds of games from the arcade, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, SNES, and many more. While the Antstream is free to download and access, gems or a subscription will be needed to play anything. Epic is offering a welcome pack available for free until Thursday for new players to check out the service, which provides 1090 gems to mess around with. Most games cost 30 gems per play, though, for the price of $39.99 a year, you can play any solo or co-op game without having to pay extra.
Antsteam features additional benefits to those playing on its platform, including achievements and challenges. Tournaments are also available, pitting your high scores and feats against others in games like Mortal Kombat, Dig Dug, Chain Reaction, or Marble Madness. Winning or scoring highly in these contests will payout in gems to spend on other games or enter future tournaments.
There looks to be plenty to check out with Antstream Arcade, with many cool old arcade and console games to try. I&#x27;m eyeing some of the SNK and Commodore 64 collections, myself. Keep in mind that you aren&#x27;t downloading any of these games, so making sure you have a strong network connection will be critical for an optimal experience. Along with the addition to the Epic Games Store, Antstream Arcade is available on PC, iOS, and Android devices.</span>

                    <span>Strategists ready to return to the battlefields of World War II have the chance to play in the Company of Heroes 3 pre-alpha multiplayer test starting tomorrow. 
A video from developer Relic Entertainment, featuring principal producer Morain McLaughlin, details some aspects of Company of Heroes 3 players can expect to play around with during the test. While the final product will include more factions (including the Italian battalion, which will be detailed next year), players will get their hands on the American and German forces. Each military force will feature two battlegroups to explore, replacing the doctrines and commanders from previous games. These battlegroups will offer a tree of abilities, units, and upgrades to select and utilize throughout a match.

The pre-alpha test will primarily be a multiplayer-focused affair, but those who wish to take on the computer-controlled AI in 1v1 or 2-player vs. 2-CPU have the option to do so. If you&#x27;re playing by your lonesome against the CPU, you&#x27;ll have access to the tactical pause feature not present in modes with more than one person. 
Other new features available will be outfitting vehicles with side armor, a veterancy system, and verticality in maps. Relic promises more updates in 2022, including new factions, units, and mechanics to be revealed over the coming months.
Preloading is available right now on Steam for established COH-Development account holders. Anyone new to the COH-Development program can head over to the game&#x27;s community site and sign up for an account there. Company of Heroes 3 is aiming for an unspecified 2022 release date for PC.</span>

                    <span>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, the sci-fi strategy adventure game by Vanillaware (makers of Odin Sphere and Dragon’s Crown), is making its way to Switch on April 12. The game has only been available on PlayStation 4 since it launched in March 2020. 
The game blends side-scrolling visual novel adventure with real-time strategy. Players control 13 ordinary high school students who also pilot giant mech suits called Sentinels. Okay, so they’re not that ordinary. The story primarily revolves around stopping an invasion, but the sci-fi tale branches in all sorts of wacky directions, many of which draw inspiration from stories like War of the Worlds and The Terminator. While you’ll use your mech to defend the world in RTS battles, the real meat of 13 Sentinels is navigating the intertwining, non-linear narratives of the students. Each teenager has their own story arc, and you’ll jump back and forth between them all to uncover the entire bonkers storyline. Take a look at the Switch announcement trailer below for an idea of what to expect.

In our review of the PS4 version, we scored 13: Sentinels an 8 out of 10, with former GI editor Joe Juba describing it as a “fun and ambitious experience that combines high-school drama and huge robots in a (mostly) beautiful package.” You can read our full review here.

                    <span>With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to release in just a few weeks, Sony producer Amy Pascal has revealed that we’ll be seeing more of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. 
Pascal said No Way Home is not the last Spider-Man movie Sony Pictures Entertainment is making with Marvel Studios in a new interview with Fandango. She also revealed that Holland’s next movie will be the first in a new trilogy. 
“This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel – [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,” Pascal told Fandango. “We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel. We’re thinking of this as three films, and now we’re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.” 
As you can see in Pascal’s quote above, Holland’s Spider-Man will be seen in at least one more Spider-Man movie. He could also appear in the following two movies, but that’s not guaranteed considering Pascal didn’t specifically say Holland will be in all three. Perhaps he appears in the first of this new trilogy and then hands off the title to someone like Miles Morales. Perhaps he remains Spider-Man in all three films of the new trilogy. 
News of a new Spider-Man trilogy from Sony and Marvel is exciting, particularly because Holland is set to star in at least the first one. Some online have speculated that Holland would be meeting his demise in No Way Home based on trailers and footage released for the film so far. It would seem that’s not the case, though. 
Alongside today’s news, three new No Way Home posters were released as well. You can check out each of them below.

                    <span>If you’re struggling to make meaningful progression in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer, which launched early as a separate free-to-play package, you’re not alone – 343 Industries’ head of design feels your pain. 
343 head of design Jerry Hook tweeted about a game called Len’s Island and then replied to that tweet to explain that he was playing both Len’s Island and Halo Infinite’s multiplayer. He said he’s feeling everyone’s pain in terms of progression and that the team is working on it, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. 
“Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be the top of my list with the team.”



Yes I am still playing Halo and feeling everyone’s pain on progression. We are back at it next week and this will be top of my list with the team.
November 28, 2021
As you can see in Hook’s tweet above, work on multiplayer’s progression continues to be a top priority for 343 Industries, which is likely also head down on the Halo Infinite campaign that launches on December 8. One important aspect of the entire discourse surrounding the multiplayer progression is that the game is still technically in beta. 
Yes, 343 Industries is selling a battle pass that costs real money in it and it’s fair to want that battle pass to feel fair, but this beta period for multiplayer was likely enacted for this very reason: to get a feel of the community’s thoughts on it and progression, and make changes based on those feelings ahead of the full December 8 launch.

For now, read about how 343 is investigating Halo Infinite’s battle pass progression and then check out this breakdown of the recent changes made to it. Be sure to read up on what you can unlock in Halo Infinite’s multiplayer this week after that.

                    <span>End Global 7, a coop company composed of prominent development studios, released a Q3 2021 Investor Presentation that detailed revenue/financial gains and a project pipeline for future IPs. The information packet revealed Dimensional Ink Studios, the team behind DC Universe Online, is working on another MMO. However, this time, players will be suiting up as created Marvel superheroes and (potentially) supervillains. The new Marvel MMO is currently in development, but the unexpected announcement is exciting nonetheless. 
According to the slide entitled &quot;Exciting Product Slate for 2022 and Beyond,&quot; Dimensional Ink Studios is coming off a solid year with DCUO cornering the market for successful superhero-based MMOs. The studios&#x27; most popular title is celebrating its 10th anniversary and &quot;performing near its peak historical annual revenues.&quot; Under the &quot;medium-term&quot; banner (seen above), a graphics overhaul and massive content expansion are in the works and slated for a 2023 release. 
However, under the &quot;longer-term&quot; banner, an unannounced MMORPG is underway. The important bullet points read as follows:
Marvel IP based massively multiplayer online game
Being developed by Dimensional Ink Studios in Austin, TX
Led by Jack Emmert, who designed and helmed City of Heroes, and currently leads DCUO
It&#x27;ll probably be a long time before we get any notable info about this new Marvel MMORPG. Still, based on Dimensional Ink Studio&#x27;s pedigree, we can expect to see fun customization options, beloved heroes and villains to interact with, and exciting leveling systems with raid scenarios. 
In other news, a bunch of  games featuring beloved Marvel and DC characters are around the bend. Be sure to check out Marcus Stewarts&#x27; Wolverine, Suicide Squad, And The League Of Upcoming Superhero Games piece to learn more.

                    <span>Update, 11/29/21:
Deck Nine has revealed the new release date for Life Is Strange: True Colors on Switch after being delayed back in September. 
Initially set to release in September alongside the other versions of the game, True Colors was delayed to a later unannounced date, putting less pressure on the team for the release of True Colors. Deck Nine has revealed that True Colors will hit Switch digitally on December 7, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. The physical release of it on Switch won&#x27;t happen until February 25, 2022, though. 
Before picking up True Colors next week on Switch, be sure to check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer&#x27;s Life Is Strange: True Colors review.

Though December can sometimes be a quiet month in terms of major retail releases, it&#x27;s likely to serve up a number of tempting smaller titles. One that may deserve a spot on the wishlist is Aspire: Ina&#x27;s Tale, which arrives on 17th December priced at 12.99 USD / 12.99 EUR / 10.29 GBP.
As you can see in the trailer it could offer some excellent visuals and audio, and the storyline also sounds interesting. Developer Wondernaut Studio looks to have produced some puzzle platforming along with the storytelling angle:

Mathews served as the Lead Technical Engineer on the Metroid Prime trilogy and has been speaking to the Kiwi Talkz podcast about their development.

                    <span>A Killing Game for your wallet.
As we&#x27;ve established previously, Danganronpa is pretty skeevy in its narrative. Thankfully, though, it has managed to avoid bringing said skeev outside of its world, outside of the fictional space that makes it somewhat more palatable. Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp, unfortunately, rather breaks that promise.
The &quot;bonus game&quot; element of the Danganronpa Decadence package (though also available separately), Ultimate Summer Camp is an expansion of a post-game feature from Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, the strangely-titled &#x27;Ultimate Talent Development Plan&#x27;. Here, you&#x27;re presented with a similar board game structure; pick a character from the casts of all four games (yes, even the insipid and un-ported Ultra Despair Girls) and take them out onto the tiles — literally — rolling dice, playing cards and watching your stats shoot up.

                    <span>A real Class act.
Everything was leading up to this. Danganronpa. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. The anime Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak High School. Even the god-awful, mercifully not re-released for Switch Ultra Despair Girls. It has all lead to Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, the crowning achievement of the series and, quite frankly, one of the best visual novels ever produced.
There’s no avoiding this, so we’ll lead with the fact that V3 is a contentious, challenging game. Some will scoff at the idea of something so avowedly crass having any higher-minded ideas at play, but Danganronpa V3 – more so than any other video game we’ve ever played – is a work of autocriticism, an existential piece of thinking that has its cake and eats it quite gleefully.

                    <span>Nagito you will never know, anything about my home.
It’s Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, and this time it’s on a tropical island. Now, being a sort of anime-ish game, you’d think that means the variously endowed female cast taking their turns to show up in swimsuits in a somewhat desperate parade of fanservice, and you’d be right! Danganronpa 2 in no way subverts this expectation, and that’s pretty much symptomatic of its approach to following up the classic original.
Don’t take that as an abrupt write-off, though. We know what we’re getting into with this series, and that’s no small amount of sleaze. Indeed, Goodbye Despair is even grosser and slimier than the first game, which is an achievement of sorts. The murders are more brutal, the solutions more convoluted and the cast of characters even more vulgar and over-the-top. It&#x27;s all that a fan could ever want, really — so why do we not like it quite as much as the first game?

                    <span>Havoc go if you think you&#x27;re hard enough.
The Danganronpa franchise is a twisted, vulgar little thing. Rife with problematic politics, egregious erotic fanservice and some truly breathtakingly ill-judged swings at far heavier themes than it really has any right to tackle, it is in many ways a reprehensible, amoral and quite appalling series of games. And it’s bloody great.
A visual novel so trashy that even people who avoid the genre like the plague ought to get a kick out of it, the original Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc Anniversary Edition remains an imperfect diamond, a marvellously depraved multiple-murder-mystery that revels in the sheer strength of its cast and the sick, nasty premise; reminiscent in some ways of classic manga Battle Royale but with a little nod to the long-running Saw series of movies, too.

                    <span>Wii would like to be young again.
Yes, we know that the Wii actually turned 15 a short time ago – November 19th, to be precise – but our video team has since gotten together to chat about the incredible impact of Nintendo&#x27;s motion-controlled behemoth.
It&#x27;s remarkable to think that this groundbreaking system is 15 years old (that&#x27;s more than half of the time Alex Olney has been on this planet, fact fans), but it&#x27;s interesting to look back at how strong the Wii&#x27;s launch was. Wii Sports and Zelda: Twilight Princess, anyone? Yes, please!

The first of a series of figures based on the Champions, Revali sports a &#x27;stoic pose&#x27; according to the manufacturer, and comes complete with &#x27;the Great Eagle Bow, which has a slightly elastic bowstring&#x27;.

Feebas, the ugly fish that evolves into a beautiful — Eel? Dragon? Snake thing? — is pretty tricky to find in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl. They only spawn in set locations, and figuring out where those locations are can be a long, arduous, and boring quest.

How can your pets loving you ever be a bad thing? Well, in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it can very easily ruin your strategies.
In the Pokémon games, there is a statistic that&#x27;s often called &quot;friendship&quot; or &quot;affection&quot;, which can affect a few different mechanics in the game. It tells the player how close that Pokémon is to them, and it can be raised through things like levelling up that Pokémon, catching it in a Luxury Ball, or letting it hold a Soothe Bell. Certain Pokémon, like Sylveon, will only evolve once the Pokémon has high enough friendship/affection.

Blimey. It&#x27;s a side-scrolling platformer featuring two-player local co-op, slime-filled planets, and some dastardly enemies to overcome.

With demand outstripping supply in the gaming space it&#x27;s led to increases in scalping and thefts, with another example appearing in the Japanese media (via Sankei and Kotaku). With Switch systems and the PS5s in particular being hard to find in Japan, one man entrusted with a significant amount of stock for delivery ended up selling them privately for a profit.
It was confirmed by police in Tokyo that a man was arrested after selling around 200 consoles and games. The unemployed man (Japanese media often reports employment status when reporting arrests) was given the goods for home deliveries in October, but instead sold them to stores in the popular Akihabara district; the value of the goods was reportedly around 5.8 million yen (approx $51,100USD) with the man&#x27;s profit from his sales reportedly being just over half that amount.

After a bit of a quiet spell throughout the 2010s, Super Monkey Ball is finally back in the spotlight where it belongs. With Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD launching on Switch in 2019, and then Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania also landing just last month, remakes are proving that interest in the franchise is still there. But what&#x27;s next?
Well, speaking in a recent issue of Retro Gamer (issue 225), Banana Mania director Masao Shirosaki has expressed interest in making an entirely new game. Ideas for a potential new title are already taking shape, and Shirosaki believes that a new game could well become a reality if enough fans are ready and waiting to check it out.

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have only been available for ten days, but speedrunners are already smashing it out of the park when it comes to beating the new games as quickly as possible.
YouTuber Werster has today shared a video showing the game being completed in just 33 minutes and ten seconds. At the time of writing, it&#x27;s believed to be the world record for an &#x27;any%&#x27; speedrun of the game, and it&#x27;s pretty mindblowing to watch.

                    <span>Twas an Elusive Age, indeed.
Dragon Quest XI is a fantastic game that you can play on Switch right now, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that back when it originally launched, it was on another Nintendo system: the 3DS.
When Dragon Quest XI hit Japanese store shelves in 2017, it was released on the PS4 and 3DS. The 3DS version is fascinating because it&#x27;s a totally different game in terms of presentation; Nintendo&#x27;s handheld obviously couldn&#x27;t compete with the PS4 in terms of processing power, so it got a unique version of the adventure. What&#x27;s even more amazing is that initially at least, the 3DS version out-sold the PS4 edition.

                    <span>Figure it out.
Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain is out later this week on 3rd December, and is the final show in town for major first-party Switch arrivals ahead of the Holiday, though with October and November bringing sales successes with Metroid Dread and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl it&#x27;s normal for the final month of the year to be focused more on GOTY debates and smaller releases.
With Dr Kawashima&#x27;s Brain Training for Nintendo Switch never being released in North America, Big Brain Academy will help Nintendo fill a gap in that market, while its multiplayer and cutesy style also offer something a little different in global markets. Now we have a localised and amended version of an overview trailer that arrived recently in Japan, showcasing its modes and play options.

                    <span>And it&#x27;s coming soon.
Nintendo has announced the arrival of a brand new update for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and it sounds like this could well be the last.
Taking the game to version 13.0.1, following on from the 13.0 update that introduced Sora, this latest patch will certainly be the final update relating to fighter adjustments. As is always the case, Nintendo has advised players to convert any saved replays before the patch arrives as they&#x27;ll no longer be compatible once it&#x27;s been downloaded:

UK physical chart data is now in for the week ending 27th November, revealing that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has once again found itself at the top of the table.
Jumping up from a seventh-place finish last week, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was featured in a special Black Friday Switch bundle deal, no doubt explaining the sudden boost in sales. It managed to outsell other holiday season favourites FIFA 22 and Minecraft to get there, the former of which actually sold better on Switch this week than it did on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.

Black Friday 2021 has been and gone, but we&#x27;re still knee-deep in deals because Cyber Monday is now upon us. If you&#x27;re anything like us you&#x27;re keeping an eye out for Nintendo Switch best deals. Jostling in crowded stores isn&#x27;t something we&#x27;d recommend, but there&#x27;s no reason to miss out on a bargain when you can get the best deals brought to your doorstep.

                    <span>Here we are, chums, Cyber Monday. Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. What was once an interesting online addition to the Black Friday feeding frenzy, is now a withered and useless appendage. We all shop online now and Black Friday lasts for at least three months of the year. Well, either that or I’m in some kind of deals post writing, Groundhog Day-esque limbo. Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black. Like this HyperX Cloud Alpha S headset which is now discounted at Amazon.

                    <span>I don’t know about you, but when I hear the word odyssey, I’m expecting something grand, something mythic, something literally homeric. Samsung’s line of monitors certainly contains models that fit the bill, including the cyclopean Odyssey G9. Sadly, such excess isn’t always practical. Your desk just isn’t big enough or, for some reason, you don’t have a grand just sitting around to spend on a monitor. Despite that, you still want to have a little odyssey, as a treat. An odyssette, maybe? Which I’ve just discovered is a real word and not something I made up for a bad gag. Well, don’t worry, chums, I’m here with a deal on the much more manageable Samsung Odyssey G5, for when you’re feeling just a little bit epic.

                    <span>Back in August, which is obviously an unfathomable length of time ago, the adverts for a mobile game called Merge Mansion went semi-viral on Twitter. The post was not unwarranted. The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.
In that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she&#x27;s written a message on the palm of her hand reading &quot;He is alive&quot;. I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.

                    <span>Gamesplanet is the next in a long line of vendors to post up its seasonal offerings - now into its second week of Xmas deals. In other words, this isn&#x27;t a Cyber Monday sale per se, though if you were already in a shopping mood from all the other Cyber Monday deals floating around you can still avail yourself of some big savings.
Last year&#x27;s festive Gamesplanet sale had some major discounts, and this year is no different. There has been a lot of releases to chew through this year, and with the end of lockdown sapping all of our collective motivation away, it meant that some things could slip through the net. But that&#x27;s where the sales come in, so we can pick up those games we were eyeing up for cheap.

                    <span>Earlier this month, Platinum Games held a closed beta for their upcoming action RPG, Babylon&#x27;s Fall. For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that&#x27;s because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.

                    <span>It’s not something my parents tell their friends, but I am a man who has played every Call Of Duty campaign. I’ve been in more helicopter crashes than you could believe. I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
Unless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.

The 128GB version of Oculus&#x27; standalone headset is now down to £249 for Cyber Monday, knocking £50 off the price of the headset. We&#x27;ve only spotted the deal at Amazon at the moment, but the good news is that they&#x27;re still running the £50 / $50 credit voucher promo in additon to the headset saving, which means you save a total of £100 if you buy one today.

                    <span>They Always Run is the closest I’ve come to living out my dream of being a galactic bounty hunter. It’s a 2D platformer with two distinct halves to its gameplay. One portion is a rewarding parkour simulator, and the other’s this heavy, visceral combat system that I never got tired of. You play as a three-armed mutant called Aiden as he hops between planets collecting bounties, which are presented through a series of action-platformer linear levels. It almost never goes as planned. The title’s pretty accurate.

                    <span>Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer beta has only been out for a couple of weeks, but the free-to-play FPS doesn&#x27;t have effective anti-cheat, and it&#x27;s really beginning to show. Players have been posting clips on social media of supposed cheaters using wallhacks, aimbots and more. Now Xbox Halo players are asking developers 343 Industries for an option to turn crossplay off, so they don&#x27;t have to deal with pesky PC hackers.

                    <span>It may be below freezing outside, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our hard working PCs will keep as cool. Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it&#x27;s vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.
Thankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.

What actually is the Marvel MMO? A secret, for now. But I wouldn&#x27;t feel wrong making some assumptions.

                    <span>Welcome to Cyber Monday, gang. While today usually marks the last chance to jump on any lingering Black Friday deals, there can and will be some shiny new savings on PC gaming hardware as well – hardware like the Gigabyte B550M DS3H, a microATX motherboard that’s dropped into prime territory for first-time builders on tight budgets.


Amazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.

CETIN tak reaguje na zvyšující se nároky spojené zejména se stále rozšířenějším využitím cloud computingu, videokonferencí či streamování – prostě všech aktivit, které vyžadují posílení uploadu. Zájemci o tyto nové tarify je mohou získat od poskytovatelů, kteří danou akci využijí, zrychlení ovšem není automatické a záleží na nabídce providerů, píše CETIN v oznámení.</span>

Nejpodstatnější změnou je nová verze dirstate (vnitřních struktur), díky čemuž by se měly zrychlit některé operace (commit, diff apod.) a dále je možné ukládat k souborům víc metainformací.</span>

                    <span>The first season of Game Informer’s Video Gameography explores the history of the Metroid series, and this episode is set to wrap our talk on Retro Studio&#x27;s epic trilogy of Prime with a detailed discussion of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. 
Released on August 27, 2007 for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is often considered one of the best games on Nintendo&#x27;s unique motion sensing console. During today&#x27;s show we talk about what made 2007 such an phenomenal year and why we Prime 3 often gets overlook in the shuffle. We also talk about how Prime 3 might be the best entry in the Prime series thanks to it innovative motion controls and the Hypermode system, which allowed Samus to dish out some serious damage. Finally, we speculate if Samus is just an intergalactic version of Batman.
Join hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, lead community producer at Twitch Zach Ryan (@ZachariusD) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime&#x27;s lore, development history, and lasting impact.

                    <span>Well, chums, Black Friday itself has been and gone. I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.

                    <span>As those of you who have been hiding behind my sofa, or just read our “What are we all buying this Black Friday?” article, are aware, the top item on my Black Friday shopping list was a new chair. I did manage to procure a solid bottom-rest at a good discount and I’m very happy with my purchase. Unfortunately, it still cost a good chunk of change, leaving me with much less to spend on my recently rediscovered Warhammer habit.

Luckily for anyone still looking for somewhere to park their behind while gaming, you can get your hands (cheeks?) on a Razer Iskur gaming chair worth £500 for free. You do have to buy a laptop first though.

                    <span>Around this time last year, I put out a call for headset recommendations, looking for something cheapish and not terrible. An Internet Friend offered me an old set and I gratefully accepted, not being in the position to turn down free stuff. A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears. Using it is like having an angel gently hug my head while they whisper game noises in my ears.

Which is all just a long-winded way of saying that the SteelSeries Arctis headsets are very good and you should totally check out the SteelSeris Arctis 7 deals we have featured below the jump.

                    <span>Rest up, reader dear. The most important day of year is almost here: Cyber Monday. And it&#x27;s likely to be a big one! I do not know why so many of the megacorps now celebrate the day dedicated to all those cyberpunks who fight against injustice and corruption every day of their lives, but it&#x27;s a day which deserves recognition. So rest today and play some games in-between polishing your mirrorshades, dusting off your leather, and preparing a fresh boot disc. On Monday we hack the planet, but what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>If you buy the yearly iteration of your favorite sports video game, chances are you haven’t had much to cheer about the last few years. To put it bluntly, the genre is struggling, and even the new console generation hasn’t been the answer to rejuvenating it. Take just this year, for example. Metacritic scores are anything but impressive for the biggest sports around. Madden NFL 22 earned an abysmal 60, NHL 22, which promised to change its metagame, disappointed with a 74. NBA 2K has largely been the franchise to beat, but NBA 2K22 only holds a 76, some of the lowest marks the series has seen in years. FIFA 22 and MLB: The Show 21 earned the highest averages, around 78, but it’s telling that none of these franchises could even crack the 80 mark. 
This downward trend has been going for some …</span>

                    <span>The holiday gifting season is fast upon us, and many of us have kids in our family or friend groups who are hoping for something fun wrapped up to enjoy. Beyond gift-giving, if you’ve got a family of your own, you may be trying to come up with ways to keep yourself and the kids entertained over the holiday break from school. Either way, I can say with confidence that a good family board game is worth its weight in gold, both for keeping everyone happily entertained, but also ensuring some fun shared activities to make memories.
The board gaming hobby has no shortage of wonderful family games, but I’ve kept the focus here on mostly newer projects that you may not have heard of. As you consider which game might be right for your family group, make sure and check against the age recommendatio…</span>

                    <span>I’ve played a lot of Halo Infinite since its free-to-play multiplayer suite launched during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Celebration last week. Coincidentally, I’ve also watched way too much TikTok since then. It’s a real problem I’m dealing with right now. In-between the cooking tutorials and cursed comedy sketches populating my For You page, I’ve stumbled upon several Halo Infinite multiplayer tips that positively affected my knowledge and skill.
In the spirit of Thanksgiving – and being the generous person I am – I’d like to give back to the gaming community by sharing a curated list of the best videos I’ve watched while doom-scrolling this hellscape of a social media app.

                    <span>With winter just on the horizon, this is the last entry in our Fall For Indies series. So, it seems only fitting to end with a glut of great titles to keep players sustained over for the long, dark months ahead. One of our most anticipated games this year, Solar Ash, was originally slated to arrive earlier in the season but is now hitting just ahead of the frostiest time of the year. And while the nights are getting darker sooner, there are still plenty of bright indie launches we’ve got our eye on for the rest of 2021 and beyond.

                    <span>From Thanos to Batman, Fortnite is becoming a comic book fan&#x27;s dream come true. If Epic Games keeps adding Marvel and DC characters at a rapid-fire clip, there&#x27;s a chance we could have an awesome showdown of 100 heroes and villains years down the road. The latest addition is The Batman Who Laughs, a prominent character in the new Fortnite comic book published by DC Comics. Epic surprisingly didn&#x27;t create any skins for the recently released movie, Eternals.

                    <span>When you think of Disney today, there’s a good chance either Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to mind. That’s not surprising either – it’s the two properties Disney pumps the most time and money into. 
In games, it seems as if Disney exclusively pours resources into them – yes, there’s Kingdom Hearts, which has been great for decades but it seems that series is heading into a decidedly less Disney-based future – and it’s a shame because the nearly 100-year-old company has so much to offer to the video game space, both to classic fans and new ones alike. That’s why Disney needs to tap into its history.
I love a good Star Wars or MCU flick, and I, for the most part, love a game set in a galaxy far far away or in a Marvel-based timeline. But let’s be honest: we almost always k…</span>

                    <span>This holiday season, maybe you&#x27;re traveling. Maybe you&#x27;re not. Maybe you&#x27;re going to be stuffing massive quantities of turkey into your craw, with handfuls of stuffing and cranberry gobbler sandwiches for weeks of high-quality leftovers. Perhaps you&#x27;re just hanging out with a can of carbonated water and a good video game. Whatever you&#x27;re doing, the holidays can be full of hustle and bustle, stress, good times, and everything else – so it might be time for an idle game. A game you can boot up, make a few decisions, and then either return to it five minutes later, five hours later, or even five days later. Good idlers, also known as &quot;clickers&quot; since the genre primarily began with games that took tons of tapping or clicking alongside idle economy and resource management, can be tough to find.…</span>

Due to my lowly status, I’m not allowed to handle such hallowed items, so I must consult the wisdom of my betters. We haven’t written about the wired HyperX Cloud II 7.1 headset, but Katharine looked at the wireless version, which is the same, but with less wire. Katharine again, hmm? Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is she using her boss lady powers to get all the good stuff? Or did she just used to be our hardware editor? I’ve connected the dots!

Since I have promised not to publish my thirty seven page manifesto entitled “Why I think dogs should vote,” I’m going to talk about this BenQ MOBIUZ EX2710Q monitor instead.

                    <span>As awards season approaches and I start to compile a list of all the great games I missed this year, there&#x27;s one game I really regret not covering in more detail at RPS around the time it came out. That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn&#x27;t win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn&#x27;t rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever played.

                    <span>Typically, I&#x27;d associate Google Docs with work, and any form of spreadsheet with even more work, but indie game developer &quot;droqen&quot; has made me reassess that outlook. He&#x27;s the dev behind the 2D platformers Starseed Pilgrim and Probability 0, and now Demon Deleter, a game in which you have to delete the names of a bunch of demons from a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s a simple yet surprisingly fun idea that lets players hang out in this unusual shared space together. The inspiration behind it is pretty random too - droqen tells me he got the idea after spending hours cataloguing items for Animal Crossing.

                    <span>I’m not going to do it. I refuse. I know that it’s Actual Black Friday and I’ve had a bit of a rubbish week and coming up with new openers to these deal highlights is starting to get a bit difficult now. I don’t care that I have a bunch of Google docs that have stuff like “I’ve been playing Empire of Sin so I know all about offers you can’t refuse oh this is bloody awful and you are an absolute hack Caelyn” written in them. It doesn’t even matter that this is RPS and Baron James von Hardware-Editor is quite happy to let me make all the puns I like (well, don&#x27;t test me - J). I have standards and that means I will not make the obvious Crucial joke.
Actually I will. It’s Crucial that you check out these fantastic portable SSD deals.

                    <span>Before Black Friday I considered harnessing its powers to my own benefit, by upgrading from my current, increasingly defective and technically stolen chassis. Now I may have found that new case, and I’m willing to share: it’s the NZXT H710 and it’s a healthy £40 off.

                    <span>I&#x27;d say call your family, but do we not all view phonecalls as deeply suspicious now? My phone is a glass-and-silicon brick for displaying text that makes me unhappy.
It&#x27;s been a while since we&#x27;ve found ourselves here, looking at some indie games, and once again I have been drawn to some that are a little melancholy, but in a sort of healing, wholesome way. I&#x27;m not sure if that says anything great about my state of mind right now, but hey - the nights are drawing in, there&#x27;s a bit of a nip in the chip, and it&#x27;s the time of year when we&#x27;re encouraged to think about family, found or otherwise. And who in their 30s doesn&#x27;t get sad thinking about that.

                    <span>When the PC version of Monster Hunter Rise arrives in January, it will include all the post-launch content released so far on Switch, Capcom have confirmed. Yes, this includes the weird Sonic The Hedgehog crossover which launches today. So when the game finally comes our way, it&#x27;ll be both larger and sillier.

Battlefield 2042&#x27;s in a bit of state, so we talk about the many patches scheduled to fix it up. We&#x27;ve also heard that those banned in Call Of Duty: Vanguard will be banned across the entire series, which is nice. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer surprise launched and Outriders DLC appears out of nowhere too. Imogen rounds off the news with her Apex Legends ranked update. Has she reached the platinum dream?

It might not be as big as Steam&#x27;s sale (check out our Steam Autumn Sale recommendations) but GOG&#x27;s games are (mostly) DRM-free, and many of their good discounts are the same. Deals include 90% off Shadow Tactics, half-price Cyberpunk 2077, 80% off The Witcher 3 GotY... yeah, these will do nicely.

                    <span>I recently spent a couple of weeks with the Roccat Pyro as my main work and gaming keyboard, and it was a lovely bit of kit for the price; full-size mechanical keyboards rarely cost under £100, yet here was one that started at £90 and had everything a typical PC gamerist could ask for. Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.


For such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. 


Sadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.

                    <span>If you enjoy carefully constructing a lineup of warriors in games like Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train, here&#x27;s a surprising recommendation: play Super Auto Pets. The free-to-play auto-battler reminds me much more of those games than the likes of Dota Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics, focused on building and arranging a line whose abilities will compliment each other. And for something so cute and simple-sounding, it has a delightful amount of buildcrafting. Even the F2P monetisation is good!

The deals converge, parting the clouds and blackening the sky until but one shines through: £110 off the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X. Hey. That’s pretty good.

The angels, you see, the divine powers, they did not anticipate that the world had changed, and instead of a hundred million people still impressed by hot food, they had to deal with 8 billion who had long since invented the AK47, and when the holy fires came, humanity tooled up.
This is how the Sin Collector Colon Repentless starts. I am enjoying it a great deal.

                    <span>Is there anything better than sitting down to a big feast, surrounded by friends and family on Thanksgiving? Yes. Absolutely crushing a culinary rival before sitting down to that feast. Which is why, this year, I sparked up a totally friendly cooking competition with Game Informer’s resident Instagram chef, Brian Shea. Of course, I have no cooking skills. Even the least flammable foods turn to fiery ash as soon as I enter the kitchen. But that doesn’t matter because I have a virtual ace up my sleeve.
I’ve been putting Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ newly introduced stove through its paces, growing crops, stealing techniques from villagers, and gathering all possible ingredients to whip up some mouth-watering dishes. So, instead of a fair fight that I’d lose, I challenged my fellow editor t…</span>

                    <span>Thanksgiving Day used to be the start of the holiday shopping season, and the parade Macy&#x27;s holds in the middle of New York City every year is designed to promote the biggest names and brands you&#x27;ll be hearing about for the next month. Given how big of an industry video games have become in the last 40 years, you&#x27;d think every other balloon in the show would feature a memorable Nintendo or Sony character hovering down the chilly street. Surprisingly, that&#x27;s not the case, and only a handful of characters and games have had the honor to join in the festivities. We&#x27;ve collected them here in one place for you to gawk at, and have ranked them for your enjoyment.
Here are all of the video game balloons featured in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade over the years:

                    <span>Solar Ash represents a dramatic leap forward for Heart Machine. After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.
In Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus. Given that Solar Ash takes place in a beaut…</span>

                    <span>With Thanksgiving upon us, there are two types of people out there: the person who’s been thinking about the upcoming turkey meal since November 1 or the person who jumps straight to the winter holiday of Christmas, Hanukkah, or something else. Regardless of where you land, there’s a good chance that you’ll be eating some kind of breakfast, lunch, or dinner with family and friends sometime in the next two months. 
These meals can be fantastic, but they can also be a nightmare for those that hate these typical family gatherings. The same can be said for family gatherings and meals in video games, and we’ve gathered up some of our favorites. Here are 10 of the best family meals in video games.

                    <span>Thanksgiving sucks. It&#x27;s the one time of year you see all those family members you spend the other 364 days of the year avoiding. You know, the cousin that&#x27;s way into NFTs and meme stocks. The uncle who listens to the Joe Rogan Experience and somehow finds a way to reference it at every drop of the hat. It&#x27;s all just exhausting. 
And that doesn&#x27;t even get at how bad turkey is. Turkey is like the Bunny Bread of meats. Dry, flavorless, and gross. Thanksgiving is a problematic holiday for many reasons, but I think turkey is the cherry on top of this crap sundae. How have we made such a bland, ugly bird the centerpiece of this entire annual tradition? Don&#x27;t get me started on those weird things under turkeys&#x27; chins. I find it unfathomable that people eat these creatures.

The Game Informer Show is back, and we&#x27;re discussing some of the best games of the year that may have not gotten the spotlight they deserve. We chat about Inscryption, Before Your Eyes, and so much more with special guest Ty Galiz-Rowe, editor-in-chief at Uppercut, a video game site focused on insightful features, articles, and reviews from people that come from marginalized groups. As always, we end the show with another fun round of listener questions as we wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving!

                    <span>When Halo: The Master Chief Collection was announced in 2014, fans were excited at the prospects of bringing forward the mainline Halo series to the brand new Xbox One with myriad enhancements and ways to engage with the multiplayer. Unfortunately, the launch of the compilation, which originally included Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4, featured several problems surrounding the multiplayer suite and The Master Chief Collection seemed like it was well on its way to being one of the cautionary stories of unfulfilled potential within the games industry.
The disappointing launch, underwhelming feature set, and broken matchmaking could have been the way we look back on Halo: The Master Chief Collection in 2021, but developer 343 Industries wasn&#x27;t satisfi…</span>

                    <span>It’s 4pm on Thanksgiving Day. You’re probably stuffed with turkey right now, or in the process of stuffing yourself with turkey, or still waiting to stuff yourself with turkey. (If you ate ham, get the hell out of here.) You know what that means? It’s time to make hats!
Making turkey hats is an old Thanksgiving tradition. It’s not hard to see why; turkey hats combine two of our favorite things: food and fashion. Hats also make your head look bigger, which will convince people that your brain is huge.

People who wear hats are often the life of the party. Need proof? Check out this picture of Spock.

Boy what a boring guy. Now, what if we throw a hat on him?

Instant party animal! You too can be this guy. But instead of making the traditional Turkey hat for Thanksgiving, why not make a hat …</span>

The arrival of Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign is imminent. To get you ready for December 8, we sat down with the team at 343 Industries to learn everything we need to know about the upcoming return of Master Chief.


Halo Infinite takes place 18 months after the events of Halo 5, and a lot has changed since we last saw the Xbox icon. The UNSC is fighting for its life on Zeta Halo, The Banished are getting closer to completing their nefarious goals, and humanity once again hangs in the balance. Some of those tropes may sound familiar, but 343 is here to tell you why Chief&#x27;s new story should have fans excited. Quick SPOILER warning: We discuss where the characters are and some of their motivations headed into Halo Infinite. If you want to go in clean, come back to …</span>

I&#x27;ve been impressed by the 1v4 multiplayer horror game, watching it steadily grow into one of Steam&#x27;s most popular after a while looking like it might slip a way, so that&#x27;s a nice get. But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild. You know, you can skip guns and just play that as a very pretty walking simulator.

Therefore, finding a good one is imperative - especially for anyone spending long stints gaming while using said keyboard. Within the stellar range of gaming keyboards on offer, there are a few different types: ones with lights, mechanical, compact, wireless - I could go on. The beauty of Fnatic&#x27;s offering is that it covers most bases, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.

                    <span>Katharine and I went hands-on with Babylon’s Fall last week, that online action RPG by PlatinumGames which falls in and out of memory as the years tick by. Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.
As it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.

Also tune in to learn about Matthew&#x27;s new (and extremely one-sided) rivalry with an Olympic swimmer, a cavern of lies featuring bar tender Ed Harris, and a digression so self-indulgent we talk about how self-indulgent we are, and decide that it is a good thing.

                    <span>Recently, I’ve moved out of the city and into a little village in the middle of nowhere. Look outside the window and I see trees, maybe a little house nestled atop a hill. I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.
Yeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.

                    <span>Amazon Studios are &quot;nearing a deal&quot; to develop a TV series based on Mass Effect, according to a recent Deadline report. Excellent stuff. I&#x27;m all for it! If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I&#x27;d much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they&#x27;d follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don&#x27;t think we need to see more of Shepard&#x27;s side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.

                    <span>With Black Friday mere hours away, you may be looking at all the early deals on PC hardware and wondering whether it’s better to wait out for the chance of even bigger savings once the clock strikes twelve. You can, at least, rest assured about the Logitech G432, our longtime best gaming headset pick turned Black Friday bargain: it’s dropped from an original £70 to £30 on Amazon UK, and we understand it’s going to stay there until end the end of Cyber Monday on November 29th.

                    <span>After releasing Battlefield 2042 in an unready state, Dice today took a step towards fixing and finishing it by releasing a wee patch which tweaks weapon balance and fixes some bugs. Bullet spread on all guns except shotguns is reduced, for starters, making them more accurate. The ludicrous hovercraft is less murderous too. And they&#x27;ve wiped out bugs including one which left players stuck downed, unable to respawn. Read on for more.

Below are the A.I. rewrites – the seed text is in bold, and everything else is machine-generated.
Batman: Arkham Asylum
The inmates of Arkham Asylum have been set free – and it&#x27;s up to Batman to bring order to the chaos and take back the asylum. Along the way, he reunites with some old allies and discovers an even deeper secret: he isn&#x27;t the only one with a destiny, and this time, his isn&#x27;t a fairy tale.

If you’re reading this, odds are you’ll be spending just as much time catching up on the year’s best video games. It’s a lot like treating yourself to a digital feast, and given that Thanksgiving dinner is, scientifically speaking, the perfect assemblage of food, there’s only one way to determine the best combination of games you can play.

                    <span>After the first series of Resident Evil movies made over a billion dollars in box office revenue, production company Constantine Films is ready to reboot its biggest film franchise. But where the original series deviated drastically from the source material, new director Johannes Roberts – known for his work on 47 Meters Down and The Strangers: Prey At Night – wants to do right by Capcom&#x27;s original games with his new film, Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. We caught up with Roberts, to ask what it&#x27;s been like bringing the first two games to life.

Halo Infinite is having a big few weeks. On top of the free-to-play multiplayer suite launching ahead of the full game&#x27;s release on December 8, Master Chief&#x27;s next adventure is also the focus of the latest Game Informer cover story! And what&#x27;s a cover story without a brand new Rapid-Fire interview with the one and only Joseph Staten?
Join us as we sit down with 343&#x27;s head of creative to discuss all things Halo Infinite in our patented scorching-fast style. Joseph was kind enough to put up with us for 117 questions that span everything fans will want to know about one of the biggest games of 2021. In true Rapid-Fire fashion, we have plenty of questions centered on getting to the bottom of Halo Infinite. Who is the Weapon? Will there be new maps and firearms added to the multiplayer suite as time goes on? What happened to Chief and Cortana after the events of Halo 5?
It also wouldn&#x27;t be a Rapid-Fire without some questions you probably wouldn&#x27;t think to ask, like what kind of broadway musical does Chief listen to while slaying The Banished and saving the universe? You&#x27;ll get the answer to that question and so much more during this exclusive interview that you can find above!
Is the wait for Halo Infinite&#x27;s campaign feeling too long? We understand and want to help you through this time with our exciting new cover story! This month, we&#x27;re diving into a ton of new and compelling interviews, gameplay videos, and more from the team behind the next entry in Master Cheif&#x27;s story. Be sure to check out our quick looks at the game&#x27;s opening level, our campaign impressions, learn more about exploration and progression, and our look into the creation of the devious bots from the earlier versions of the multiplayer test flights. Thanks for watching, and let us know what you thought of the video in the comments below!</span>

                    <span>Children of the ’90s may remember the surge of enthusiasm surrounding Pokémon Snap’s N64 release. Unlike other popular Pokémon titles up to that point, it offered the chance to catch creatures not with a Poké Ball but with a camera. The game featured rushing rivers, sunny beaches, and dark caverns, all stuffed with familiar specimens. The most skilled players snapped – to our young minds – unbelievably realistic shots of these roving Pokémon in their natural habitats while the ever-moving vehicle pushed onward. But it wasn’t enough to capture wild pictures of our favorite creatures. We needed to share these works of art with the world.
Short of parading friends past the home console to admire our digital albums, there didn’t seem to be a good way to do so. Enter the Pokémon Snap Station. I…</span>

But where are the wine pairings for video games? To address this absence, we talked with master sommelier Morgan Harris about what types of wines go best with which games.
Before we start, we should note that wine and game pairing isn&#x27;t an exact science. Pairing wine with food often results in chemical interactions that enhance or alter flavors; this doesn&#x27;t happen with game pairings, obviously. &quot;Fundamentally, wine is a grocery which means it doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of structural overlaps with gaming, which is a leisure activity,&quot; Harris says. &quot;At their base, they&#x27;re very different things, but there is certainly some overlap and both of them are designed to give plea…</span>

                    <span>Every year, when the daylight wanes faster than I’d prefer and the air chills to bitter cold, I retreat from any outdoor activities and turn to the warmth of my computer. That’s where I sink deep into my chair, crack open some sodas and junk food, and boot up my chosen genre to escape the harsh months of Minnesota weather. It’s when I’m most at home diving deep into a good MMO.
Each winter is a new opportunity to explore another facet of the vast worlds I’ve explored many times before. Usually, my go-to MMO is World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing on and off since 2005. Maybe I never hit the current level cap on the last character I was playing, and that’s my jumping on point, or a new expansion is releasing, and I want to get caught up on the juicy lore and character moments leading …</span>

                    <span>How does a video game from another region make it into your hands, and how do companies ensure you’re getting an experience that lives up to the original? As the gaming industry becomes more globalized, video game localization is an increasingly pertinent topic. But few people actually understand what goes into the process. Preparing to release a game in a new country or region comes with many challenges that go well beyond simple translation.
When a game is localized well, it’s free of typos and grammatical errors, the dialogue is natural, and the instructions make sense. But even this is skimming the surface of the localization team’s role in the process. As games become more complex and text-heavy, not only do the challenges continue to grow, but the quality bar – and our expectations –…</span>

Epic Games is ending Fortnite&#x27;s second chapter sooner than expected. On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called &quot;The End.&quot;
This event is a one-time instance, meaning you won&#x27;t be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.
The End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.
What comes next is anyone&#x27;s guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.
What do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter? Let us know in the comments section below!</span>

Halo Infinite&#x27;s free multiplayer experience offers many avenues of play, including timed events. This week, 343 Industries introduced the game&#x27;s first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.
From now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn&#x27;t here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.
Most unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.
On top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite&#x27;s shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.
Other items in the shop include the Sentinel&#x27;s Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:</span>

                    <span>If you have family visiting for a Thanksgiving feast and a holiday weekend of relaxation and shopping, there&#x27;s a good chance the younger demographic will be looking for entertainment. If they have their iPads, they&#x27;ll likely retreat into YouTube watching mode, but you can use that screen to bring the family together for some fun game time as well. 
I rounded up a handful of games that should deliver entertainment for groups of kids and adults alike. The difficult task is finding games that are available on a wide variety of devices and offer crossplay support – meaning you can play together, even if you are on PlayStation 4 and the kids are on their iPads.
If you are just entertaining one or two kids, I also included a few games that they should get a kick out of, yet are only available on…</span>

From now until next Wednesday, Valve&#x27;s PC game store has... so many discounts. So many. This brings the start of Valve&#x27;s Steam Awards too, with nominations now open.

                    <span>Both of this year’s blockbuster FPSes, Call Of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042, launched with something up their sleeves: bugs. Even after some patches, these darn creepy crawlies aren’t shaken off so easily. These games are plagued by crashes, glitches, and general instability, to the point where playing them can be as fun as wading through a swarm of locusts.
Halo Infinite, though? The multiplayer component that had a bunch of flight tests? Pretty solid. Sure, a few bugs and matchmaking issues, but for the most part, it’s the most stable multiplayer FPS I’ve played this year. What was 343’s magic pesticide? Time. Simple as. Something Vanguard and Battlefield 2042 are only just catching up on.

                    <span>Bad news, deals friends. If you were hoping to pick up a sweet Black Friday deal on the Oculus Quest 2 this year, then you&#x27;re probably going to be disappointed. Oculus have just announced their official Black Friday deals for their standalone VR headset, and all you&#x27;re going to get is a £50 / $50 voucher to spend on today&#x27;s best VR games rather than a discount on the headset itself. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a decent amount to kickstart your VR library, but the credit voucher also has some niggly conditions attached to it that make it a lot less satisfying than a simple £50 / $50 discount off the regular headset price.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always seen The Sims series as the ultimate life-meddling games. It&#x27;s one of those, well, sims, where it&#x27;s all too tempting to recreate friends and family you know in real life and send them on a path you&#x27;ve chosen. Right now in The Sims 4, players are limited to making life choices for these Sims they&#x27;ve created, doomed to watch Neighbour Sims do their own thing. But on November 30th, the Neighborhood Stories update will let you influence what these NPCs do, from starting families to changing careers.

Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don&#x27;t worry - we&#x27;re here to help. 
WD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung&#x27;s computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman&#x27;s terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.

The battle royale has seen some fancy musical performances, with elaborate in-game events to promote pop stars including Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, but hopefully Harmonix aren&#x27;t consigned to advertising for eternity?

                    <span>Xbox has announced the Xbox Games With Gold line up for December and per usual, it includes two Xbox One games and two older-generation games. 
Four games are up for grabs this month. They are The Escapists 2 on Xbox One, Tropico 5: Penultimate Edition on Xbox One, Orcs Must Die on Xbox 360, and Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on Xbox 360. Of course, thanks to Xbox’s backward compatibility features, anyone with an Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One can download and play all four of these games. 
The Escapists 2 is a game about, well, escaping... be it from snowy tundras to deserts and more. You and up to three friends can team up to escape from some of the toughest prisons in the world, and you can do so by following the rules, learning the routines, and discovering the best ins and outs of each l…</span>

                    <span>According to announcements from both companies, music and rhythm game developer Harmonix is being acquired by Epic Games. 
Epic Games made a statement saying on its website about the company&#x27;s future, saying, &quot;The Harmonix team will collaborate closely with Epic to develop musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite while continuing to support existing titles including Rock Band 4.&quot;
Harmonix has a brief blog post on its site as well, followed by a short Q&amp;A covering the obvious questions regarding its active support for Rock Band and most recent release FUSER. Here&#x27;s the statement from Harmonix about joining the Epic family: 
For the time being, the company is sticking to keeping its upcoming seasons and events for its games in the pipeline, and won&#x27;t be discontinuing support in any way. Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.
Epic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer&#x27;s Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. 
Does this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.</span>

                    <span>Nintendo and Illumination announced that Chris Pratt would voice Mario in the upcoming Mario movie exactly two months ago. In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?
In a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal.

“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”
TooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. 
However, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. 
“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” 
Meledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades.

                    <span>With it being Xbox’s 20th anniversary this year, the company has done a lot to commemorate the special milestone. There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. 
Getting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. 
As you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. 
That’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. 
Head to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller.

                    <span>When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. 
According to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” 
Of course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. 
Do you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below!

Death is one of the few things we all have in common. We all experience death sooner or later, and that can be terrifying because we don’t truly know what awaits us on the other side. Salvation? Oblivion? Death’s Door offers an amusing interpretation of death by framing it as a boring, day-to-day business run by crows.

                    <span>Keanu Reeves has revealed that he doesn’t believe Mortal Kombat to be a good fit for John Wick or Neo. 
It’s always tough when you hear people you look up to say something wrong, but sometimes you just have to power through it and that’s what we’re all doing after Reeves told Esquire he doesn’t want his characters in Mortal Kombat. As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. 
“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” 
Look, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. 
Regardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2. 
Speaking of Injustice 2, check out our thoughts on the DC fighter in Game Informer’s Injustice 2 review and then read Game Informer’s Mortal Kombat 11 review. Check out our review of its DLC, Aftermath, after that.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game &quot;War&quot;, Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic&#x27;s Company Of Heroes does.
So it&#x27;s a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way&#x27;s demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series&#x27; core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.

                    <span>The studio behind Death Stranding have announced they&#x27;re opening a new division in Los Angeles to enter the worlds of television, film, and music. Kojima Productions have confirmed no specific projects or plans yet. Even as someone who has a lot of time and enthusiasm for Kojima&#x27;s self-serious wacky plots, I hope the plan isn&#x27;t for anything as banal as a Death Stranding movie. Their video games are delightful because they&#x27;re video games.

                    <span>Black Friday is weird. Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.


I have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.

                    <span>I was toiling away in the Black Friday deal mines when I uncovered one that our US friends might particularly appreciate: a titantic $1400 off the 2020 Razer Blade 15 Advanced. This slimline gaming laptop, complete with a 300Hz IPS display, is now only $1600 – close to half price, which is an even bigger deal when the MSRP is the same as a serviceable used car.

You know, Dream Daddy but Dream Detective or whatever.
Thing is, we&#x27;ve got Sexy Young Holmes and Sexy Young Poirot, sure, but two dudes don&#x27;t make a dating sim, right? Why, ITV needs somewhere in the region of 35 fragile young adults to head-wreck every summer in Love Island. So who else would I need hot young versions of for my imaginary dating sim game?

The Everyone Is Here update went live yesterday, bringing new challenges to Motion Twin&#x27;s soulslike that will let you unlock characters from Blasphemous, Hyper Light Drifter, Guacamelee, Skul: The Hero Slayer, Curse Of The Dead Gods, and, most importantly (for me), Hollow Knight. Hooray for Hollow Knight content!

                    <span>Cyber Monday has arrived, offering the last opportunity to grab some cheap Logitech kit this deals season. Most of the discounts from the past week remain in effect, but they&#x27;ll likely vanish come midnight so take a look now if you&#x27;re looking for a new mouse, keyboard, or anything else.

The company&#x27;s board of directors have formed this committee to oversee new policies and procedures &quot;to improve workplace culture and eliminate all forms of harassment and discrimination&quot;. And amidst calls for CEO Bobby Kotick to be removed, he&#x27;ll be one of the people in charge of bringing the committee progress reports.

If you’ve already been here albeit before Cyber Monday, then there’s a good chance more have been added.

The custom mode editor isn&#x27;t exactly swimming in creativity just yet, but interesting things are slowly beginning to emerge as time goes by.

                    <span>I doubt I’d be much cop at counting cards in Vegas, but I have just counted every single item on the patch notes for Precinct, the latest update for Romero Games’ prohibition-era kingpin sim Empire Of Sin. There are over 350 of them, from making gangsters less flirty to giving Al Capone his cigar back on the character select screen. It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. 


“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]&#x27;s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive. The team worked their asses off.”


Thankfully, the launch of the Make It Count DLC - and the accompanying free Precinct update - has been a lot smoother.

                    <span>This Friday is dubbed Black Friday in the USA because it&#x27;s a dark time, when people will literally be maimed or killed in the crush to buy cheap televisions. The lowest ebb of the year before Cyber Monday brings to the light of redemption to the world when kewl d00dz hackers hack the planet. But it does bring cheap video games. GOG have already started a small &quot;Pre-Black Friday sale&quot;, with good discounts including 50% off Disco Elysium and 50% off Cyberpunk 2077. Hmm. I might recommend it at that price?

                    <span>Riot Games&#x27; League of Legends fighting game, still known only as Project L, was shown off in much greater detail during this weekend&#x27;s Undercity Nights event, solidifying its genre, a few characters, and even its plans for online infrastructure. 
The video features executive producer Tom Cannon and technical lead Tony Cannon unveiling a verticle slice of what Project L will eventually offer. The title will remain a 2D fighting game set in the world of Runeterra, as was initially hinted towards when the game was revealed, but now we know it&#x27;ll feature 2-on-2 battles, and character assists will factor into the gameplay. &quot;We feel this is the right foundation to build a game that rewards strategic team building and on-the-fly decision making on top of strong fighting fundamentals,&quot; says the ex…</span>

                    <span>Dead Cells’ 26th update is assembling the best and brightest of the indie action adventure genre. The aptly named Everyone Is Here patch adds familiar faces from games like Hollow Knight and Guacamelee, along with their respective weapons, to use in-game.

The free update, which is now available on PC and comes consoles later this year, lets players don the costumes of the protagonists from Hollow Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Blasphemous, Guacamelee!, Skul: The Hero Slayer, and Curse of the Dead Gods. Better yet, you’ll wield the weapons/ability of each character. They control largely as you’ll remember them but have a Dead Cells twist.

You wake up in a dark cabin, chained to a worn table. A mysterious man sits on the other side of the room. You can&#x27;t see the details of his face through the darkness, but his crazed eyes pierce the shadows. Something under your belly lurches as he invites you to play a card game. The rules seem simple; you summon creatures to attack your opponent&#x27;s army of foes, and you easily win the first few hands. Still, you can&#x27;t shake the anxiety of what might happen if – no – when you lose. You play on, the eyes on the other side of the table slowly burning a hole in your stomach.
Inscryption is an incredible tone piece that taps into horror …</span>

                    <span>This isn’t the first time we’ve read a Horizon Forbidden West blog post to see what Guerrilla Games has been up to. Not only is Aloy more dynamic and realistic-looking in this new chapter, she’ll also be exploring an immense map with its fair share of cutting-edge qualities. According to lead living world designer Espen Sogn, the dev team hopes that players will “encounter a world that feels more alive and more real than ever.” And knowing the impressive pedigree of Guerrilla Games, this will likely be the case.
The latest blog post states that designing Horizon Forbidden West’s sandbox was all about maintaining authenticity. This is primarily reflected in the cultural norms of the tribes that Aloy meets. Espen mentions two tribes and juxtaposes their customs to showcase the player’s posit…</span>

                    <span>Geoff Keighley’s annual Game Awards show is right around the corner – December 9 to be exact – and a new podcast leading up to the show will dive deep into all that goes into it. 
The Game Awards announced today that it is teaming up with music streaming service, Spotify, which will be its “exclusive audio streaming partner” for the show. It also revealed that leading up to it, a limited four-episode podcast called Inside The Game Awards will be released. 
“As part of the partnership, The Game Awards creator, executive producer, and host Geoff Keighley is hosting a special 4-episode Inside The Game Awards podcast, exclusively on Spotify beginning today, highlighting the latest news on the awards ceremony, including the incredible nominees for this year’s show, and a look at the musical elements of the show, including the return of The Game Awards Orchestra.” 
Spotify will also announce the “most listened to Spotify artists and songs” on gaming platforms globally in 2021 during the show. 
The first episode of Inside The Game Awards is now live, and the other three episodes are expected to drop leading up to the actual show on December 9. While waiting for those, read through the nominations for the Game Awards 2021. Check out Game Informer&#x27;s interview with Keighley about this year&#x27;s awards show after that.

Check out the teasing teaser trailer below.

You will likely be seeing a lot of these deals posts appearing on RPS over the coming week, but I promise you this one&#x27;s properly good - because it&#x27;s us that&#x27;s on sale rather than a fancy mouse, keyboard or headset.  
From now until November 30th, yearly subscriptions to RPS are 35% off for new subscribers - and all you need to do is head over to our sign up page to get started. No codes or secret password at the Treehouse door required.

They will also put the original versions back on sale, and will give them to people who buy the remastered trilogy.

                    <span>Radiohead&#x27;s surprising collaboration with Epic Games is out now. The Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is a virtual environment designed to accompany and celebrate Radiohead&#x27;s classic Kid A and Amnesiac albums. It&#x27;s an odd project, but it&#x27;s one that makes sense for a band that are often experimental and technologically progressive.

Then they&#x27;ve also made items and costumes available for Rocket League, Fall Guys and Fortnite, turning Radiohead into just another brand to be engaged with in Epic&#x27;s dull metaversal future.

                    <span>December is here, and you know what time that is: time for the RPS Advent Calendar. We&#x27;ll soon start counting down our favourite games of the year (well, counting in no particular order until we open that final door), but what will we pick? I know, because voting has just closed. If you think you can guess, do head on over to the RPS community Discord, where this year&#x27;s calendar guessing game is underway. But first, please do tell me: what are you playing this weekend?

                    <span>Black Friday is a time of excess, kicking off a season of even more excess. In that spirit, I’ve been thinking about buying four more of my current monitor and lashing them together into a makeshift array using rope fashioned from my corgi’s shed hair. There’s no way that I could achieve such an impressive display in any other way, certainly not with a single monitor. At least that’s what I thought, until hardware ed James reminded me that the humongous Samsung Odyssey G9 exists.

                    <span>Chums, I have a confession to make. For someone writing about Black Friday PC hardware deals, I don’t know all that much about PC hardware. Oh, I’ve been building my own PCs for 20-odd years, I just sort of ran out of storage in my brain around 2011 and now I have to spend ages reading up on the latest developments every time I need to buy a new component. If only I could just slot one of these Samsung 980 Pro SSDs into my brain, I would no longer have that problem.

                    <span>The holiday season, heralded by Black Friday, is often a time for reminiscing about the past. For instance, I remember a time, a few years either side of 2000/Y2K/The Willenium, when really big pockets were a thing. Particularly if you were a bit nu-metal or a bit goth. They were great. There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into. It’s especially frustrating as I reckon you could happily fit the lovely Logitech G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless into one of those big pockets.

                    <span>While New World seems mostly to be occupied in a war against exploits like duping, forever firing off fixes or disabling features, this week brings an update focused on adding newness. That&#x27;s nice. The &#x27;Into The Void&#x27; update introduces the magical new Void Gauntlet, a weapon which can be used to heal or harm. You can perform violence upon new enemies too, because various Varangian forces have arrived to plunder the island.

                    <span>There&#x27;s no time to explain: the Intel Core i5-12600K has a Black Friday deal. I mean that&#x27;s weird, right? It only came out scant weeks ago and it&#x27;s already on the sharp end of a meaningful discount. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, mind, as this Intel 12th Gen Alder Lake mid-ranger proved itself the best CPU for gaming immediately upon arrival.

                    <span>Slipping into a military-controlled ‘dark zone’ to plunder some high-end electrical equipment sounded like an easy job. You could be in and out in minutes, in theory, slinking through the locked-down multi-storey car park with a nice sequence of slides and skids to grab your treasure before vaulting a fence and scampering off. But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.


So this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour &#x27;n&#x27; puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.

                    <span>For all the loathsome talk of the metaverse from companies like Facebook and Epic as the future of reality, many facets of the concept already exist in sandboxes like Roblox. The problem with Roblox for them is that it&#x27;s a lawless frontier town, one they don&#x27;t control. Still, Roblox is obscenely popular, so it&#x27;s popular with brands who don&#x27;t need control, they just want to advertise products. Enter Nikeland, an official Roblox game from the cobblers at Nike.

                    <span>I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.
The honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.

                    <span>Arkane&#x27;s sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said &quot;stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight&quot;. Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game&#x27;s second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.

                    <span>Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite&#x27;s multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It&#x27;s a beta, they insist. But we all know it&#x27;s the proper game because they&#x27;ve had their betas already (excuse me, &quot;flights&quot;). 
Also, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour.

                    <span>During Battlefield 2042&#x27;s week of early access for people who paid extra, players were more forgiving of bugs and wonk with the expectation that it would be fixed by a launch patch. Well, the game is out today, the launch patch has hit, and the game is still in a bit of a state. 78% of the 5500-odd player reviews on Steam are negative right now, with many complaining about crashes, poor performance, and more. Dice have said they plan to launch two patches in the next month.

                    <span>Back when Black Friday was only just revving up its deals engines, I asked you – the lovely RPS readership – to tell us about your hardware. And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.


Of course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. 


US denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down.

                    <span>Třetina českých IT profesionálů vydělává víc než 67 000 korun čistého měsíčně. Vyplývá to z rozsáhlého průzkumu společnosti No Fluff Jobs, kterého se účastnilo 4 185 IT profesionálů, z toho téměř 800 Čechů. Region střední a východní Evropy je proto podle společnosti No Fluff Jobs pro místní IT odborníky velmi lukrativní.</span>
