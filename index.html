                              <span>The Gatherer profession gains a lot of importance in Brighter Shores once you reach Hopeforest, and leveling it up quickly almost becomes a necessity if you want to proceed through the in-game content.


Like every profession, leveling up Gatherer requires you to perform the tasks that directly contribute to it. At first, this profession will seem similar to Forager, but there are some key differences between the two. Without any more delay, let&#x27;s look at how the profession exactly works in Brighter Shores and how you can level it up pretty fast.


How does the Gatherer profession work in Brighter Shores


To level up Gatherer, you&#x27;ll have to pick up different items. These would mainly be wild plants, which are common in the Hopeforest region. Some of these items are important to level up …</span>

The Democracy Space Station is, for all intents and purposes, now fully up and running. The kicker is that it&#x27;s functionally useless for the time being, until the community can rack up a significant enough resource pool to unlock new goodies. A highlight is the Planetary Bombardment perk, which is right about halfway done at the time of writing and will give us bonus Orbital Barrage Stratagems on missions and should improve liberation efforts in the future.

If your Switch Pro Controller is dead, try the sync button


Although Switch Pro Controllers have a fairly good reputation, it isn&#x27;t foolproof. Some folks, even after years of use, have reported that their controllers have entered a weird state where they seem completely dead. As in, the battery seems to be out of operation, and no amount of charging will work (the charging light won&#x27;t even come on).


As the reddit thread points out, even swapping docks/cables might not solve the issue. However, upon pressing the sync button, the controller &quot;spran…</span>

However, fans of the series already have something to look forward to. The 50th issue of Shueisha&#x27;s Young Jump magazine announced that Aka Akasaka is already working on a new manga.


Anime News Network reports that Aka Akasaka will be working with Record of Ragnarok&#x27;s Ajichika and Greek Circle Crisis&#x27; Aoi Kujira. Furthermore, the new manga series will be released in the same magazine. The story reportedly follows the love story of a prince and a princess in a fairy tale setting.


A teaser image for the new manga has also been released.

About Aka Akasaka


Aka Akasaka made his manga debut in 2015 with Kaguya-sama: Love is War. At the time, it was being published on Miracle Jump. The series was later transferred to Weekly Young Jump where it ultimately saw its conclusion in November 2022. But while the series was still in publication, Akasaka already started working on Oshi no Ko with Mengo Yokoyari.


The two titles were serialized at the same time since April 2020, which meant Akasaka was working on two titles at once. That set-up may have possibly worked for him. After Kaguya-sama: Love is War ended in 2022, Akasaka announced his retirement from drawing manga. In April 2023, he worked with Nishizawa 5mm to release yet another manga series, Renai Daiko. Renai Daiko ran from April 2023 to June 2024.


Despite working on multiple series at once, Akasaka&#x27;s works are not unloved. Kaguya-sama: Love is War won the Next Manga Award for print manga, the 65th Shogakukan Manga Award for the general manga category, and the grand prize of the BookWalker Awards. Meanwhile, Oshi no Ko was also a winner of the Next Manga Award.

                              <span>Gran Saga&#x27;s global launch, which happened a couple of weeks ago, has introduced the new gacha to mobiles and PC. 


It&#x27;s a free-to-play title that can be played on your handheld, or you could choose to download it via PC. Like every good gacha, there&#x27;s a tier list of all the characters currently available inside the game. This tier list will help you to sort out your early team, and invest the resources efficiently. 


Gran Saga tier list


I have kept three tiers to classify the characters. In Gran Saga, you can potentially use any character currently available to build your team. 



S-tier: Strong characters who should be future-proof for the power curve. 


A-tier: Decent characters who can be as good as S-tier in certain situations. 


B-tier: Good characters who will need a lot of time and investment to reach the late-game stages. 



In Gran Saga, characters also have their own elemental type, and it&#x27;s important to make a squad well-balanced in general to cover the strengths and weaknesses.

While it&#x27;s still early days, I would prefer to build a team with a single type of damage. In simpler words, it&#x27;s better to go for either a full-magic team, or a full-physical. It&#x27;s not easy as you won&#x27;t have the top-tier names from both types immediately after starting the game. That said, the pulls have so far been pretty generous, so making a top team won&#x27;t be a difficult ask at all.

Unlike the previous round of Weapon Design Contest winners that were added in patch 6.4 as part of the Credendum sets available from Radz-at-Han, this second round of weapons is going to be a lot harder (or more expensive) to get your hands on. And trust me, if any weapons are worth getting, these are.

Jeuno: The First Walk is no exception, but the obtainment method is new. 


Rather than getting to the end of Jeuno: The First Walk and finding ready-to-play Orchestrion Rolls as part of the overall loot, you need to gather up a unique item and then exchange that for Orchestrion Rolls of your choice. While this does add an extra step between finishing the raid and getting your tunes, it does mean that you get to pick and choose, rather than simply accepting what you win.

                              <span>I never thought I&#x27;d see the day when I would reach my forties (laugh it up) and Doom would still be relevant in the gaming sphere. With The Dark Ages coming sometime in 2025, id Software&#x27;s influential shooter franchise is still as strong as ever.


To say nothing of the modding community, which has been tweaking and tinkering with the classics since time immemorial. Most fan-made content may change much about the originals, but will typically keep it feeling like a traditional Doom game. However, one person decided to switch things up a bit.




ModDB user HELLKNIGHT61 thought it was high-time to remove the &quot;FP&quot; from &quot;first-person shooter&quot; and deliver a version of Doom that&#x27;s more isometric. More specifically, they&#x27;ve taken the 1993 game and rebuilt it in the Age of Empires 2 engine, turning it into some sort of classic PC gaming amalgamation.


Rip &#x27;n&#x27; tear &#x27;n&#x27; wololo


Now, before I go any further, I am aware that &quot;Age of DOOM&quot; came out a year ago. According to the download page, it was released on November 9, 2023. However, it seems to have wormed its way onto the first couple of pages of ModDB and, honestly, I&#x27;m genuinely surprised I haven&#x27;t come across this one already.


HELLKNIGHT61 describes the mod as both a &quot;tactical shooter and isometric shooter game,&quot; with some point &#x27;n&#x27; click elements to boot. Simply put: it takes the sprites and visuals from Doom (as well as the ultra violent Brutal Doom mod) and incorporates them into Age of Empire 2&#x27;s otherwise green and pleasant lands.


It&#x27;s also standalone, which means you don&#x27;t need either of the official games in order to play &quot;Age of DOOM.&quot; It features a tutorial scenario, a practice scenario, as well as a remake of the &quot;Knee Deep in the Dead&quot; chapter, which has nine maps. It&#x27;s also recommended to start with the tutorial, because a fast-paced shooter in an isometric world with tactical elements may not have the most intuitive gameplay.

The greatest weakness of this card is the lack of a role at Advanced Forward. However, it&#x27;s a great choice for those who love playing a Target Man up front. The card has Target Man++, and First Touch+. It also offers Power Shot and Press Proven playstyle, which are extremely useful. I just wish that the SBC didn&#x27;t require three TOTW items, which unnecessarily drive up the completion cost of this challenge.

Where to water the first of the plants in Life is Strange: Double Exposure


During the second chapter of Life is Strange: Double Exposure in the scene &quot;By The Horns,&quot; you can water Gwen&#x27;s plant in her office. Press the right shoulder button on your controller or the spacebar on your keyboard to skip through the lengthy cutscenes if you&#x27;ve finished this portion of the game. Gwen&#x27;s office is located in the Fines Arts Building (FAB). After she gets kicked out by the security guard, sneak inside her office. Go into the Dead reality.

In the right-hand corner of the room, you&#x27;ll see a shriveled-up plant by the fish tank. It&#x27;s under the flyer and her posters of Remember and The Flaming Mermaids. You&#x27;re given an option to water the plant. 


Where to water Max&#x27;s plant


Also in the second chapter Penumbra, you&#x27;ll have a chance to water Max&#x27;s plant in her house. Head to the Photo Finished scene at the end of the chapter. Don&#x27;t get distracted by the cat or the evidence. Instead, go to the Massive Plant in the left-hand corner of the room, next to the windows and poetry books.

Select &quot;Water&quot; to finish the task and get the Thirst Trip trophy or achievement. You&#x27;re one step closer to the platinum! You can finish other tasks like solving the Abraxas puzzle box and reading all the Platypus messages.

All Classes with Battle Rez in WoW


There are two main versions of WoW, and both differ in which classes have access to a battle res. Rather than list them together, allow me to separate the following lists for your own clarity.


Battle Res classes in World of Warcraft: Classic


In WoW Classic, the only class that can cast any sort of in-combat resurrections is the Druid, and it is quite limited in its nature. The Druid&#x27;s battle res is called Rebirth and it comes with a very hefty 30-m…</span>

With patch 7.1, a number of new training exercises were added for players to complete if they choose. 


Hall of the Novice was introduced way back in patch 3.2, and has been left relatively untouched since then with little being added. However, the training exercises are immensely useful for both new players, and those who have stepped away for a while and haven’t been keeping up with newly added mechanics.

As such, the best builds with this beast involve empowering that hip-fire gameplay further with the right loadout and attachments.


Unlocking the ASG-89 requires you to have been playing for a bit, requiring you to achieve a mid-progression rank of level 31. Once unlocked, it can be equipped at any time in the primary slot of your custom loadouts. 


What is the best build for the ASG-89 in Black Ops 6?


If you use the ASG-89 as it comes in stock, it may seem underwhelming to you, and I&#x27;d agree. This is one of the few weapons in Black Ops 6 that pretty much requires attachments to be made viable. This is largely due to its mediocre …</span>

So, let&#x27;s get you on the right track to becoming the best with the LOCKED weapon tier list below.


LOCKED Weapons Tier List

We decided to rank weapons based on their overall power, with very few exceptions, because most of them you can use in multiple positions. Use the tier list as a reference so you know which weapon to aim for when rerolling in LOCKED, but keep in mind that the weapon should also suit your playstyle and position if you want to use it to its full potential.

In SU, playing on private servers is the only way to play certain game modes and fully customize your experience. However, they aren&#x27;t cheap, and instead of creating one, you can join a server that already exists. To do that, you&#x27;ll need the Shonen Unleashed private server codes we listed right below.

We&#x27;ve seen a lot of Zelda remake projects over the years here at Nintendo Life, but every so often, one pops up that makes us think, &quot;oof, yes please&quot;. Spoiler: that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re thinking here.
2D animator Hugo Vasgestian dos Santos (Vasge on YouTube) has recently set out to remake the first dungeon from the OG The Legend of Zelda.

Edelweiss&#x27; indie hit Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin delighted many when it launched back in 2020. It mixed side-scrolling action RPG elements with a methodical and steady farm sim, and it outperformed all expectations, selling over 1 million copies.
Today, in a surprise announcement, publisher XSEED has revealed Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation, a spin-off focusing on Saluna&#x27;&#x27;s close friend, Princess Kokorowa, the goddess of invention.

Famitsu has shared the latest look at the Japanese charts and Super Mario Party Jamboree has finally been kicked off the top spot by... more Mario.
Yes, Nintendo&#x27;s latest, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, hasn&#x27;t been troubled by its somewhat mixed reception as the new RPG sold a sweet 63,441 copies (small potatoes for the series) and sailed to pole position in its debut week. Jamboree is still on the podium, naturally, this time taking the silver while Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven continues to sell well and claims third place.

Publisher Thunderful has confirmed that it is launching another restructuring program aimed at reducing its workforce by up to 100 employees.
As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, Thunderful is looking to “increase its focus on third-party publishing and reduce the production of internally developed projects”, therefore resulting in significant redundancies within the company’s own development teams. In addition, roles within administration and management will also be affected.

We’ve been waiting almost 10 years to understand what the final words of Xenoblade Chronicles X mean. We’re used to earth-shattering plot reveals from Monolith Soft at this point, but even for Tetsuya Takahashi, the final sequence of Xenoblade Chronicles X drops a metric ton of them, offering more questions than answers.

2022&#x27;s delightful top-down dungeon crawler, Dungeons of Dreadrock, is getting a sequel. Dungeons of Dreadrock 2 - The Dead King&#x27;s Secret arrives on the Switch eShop on 28th November and it looks just as tasty as its predecessor.
This one picks up exactly where the previous puzzler left off. This time, you&#x27;ll substitute the small blade and green hood (ringing any bells?) of the first game&#x27;s hero for the staff of a priestess of the Order of the Flame. With your magic powers in tow, you&#x27;ll have to journey through 100 new dungeon-crawling levels, polishing off little Zelda-esque puzzles along the way.

Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has confirmed that the firm is looking into potentially producing a handheld device for its Xbox platform.
In speaking with Bloomberg (thanks, Pure Xbox), the executive stated that the “expectation is that we would do something” in the handheld space, but was also seemingly keen to set expectations. He said that the company is producing prototypes and considering what it might do with a portable device, but he has also requested that his teams look at the current market and apply its learnings.

Both 2020&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog and its 2022 sequel finished by teasing a character that would have a big part to play in the follow-up — Tails the first time around and Shadow the second — and it seems that the third entry will be no different.

If the title and accompanying key art didn&#x27;t already give it away, this homage to Castlevania &#x27;revives&#x27; the classic interpretation of Dracula from 1931 by actor Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó (otherwise known professionally as Bela Lugosi). Developer Tezcatek worked closely with Lugosi&#x27;s granddaughter Lynne Lugosi Sparks and Lugosi Enterprises to include the legendary actor in the game.

Last month, Microsoft&#x27;s CEO Satya Nadella spoke about how Xbox was extending its gaming content to other platforms including the Nintendo Switch.
It&#x27;s unsurprisingly reignited a lot of debate about how far Xbox could go with this new strategy, and now Phil Spencer has elaborated on this during a recent interview with Bloomberg - mentioning how he doesn&#x27;t really &quot;see sort of red lines&quot; stopping certain franchises from making the jump to other platforms.

Speaking to Washington Post reporter Gene Park recently, Aonuma shared one rather interesting fact, mentioning how his teams always prioritise the gameplay with stories then used as a vessel. Here&#x27;s exactly what he had to say:

According to the creator, this new update for Nintendo&#x27;s hybrid system allows you to &quot;put hats back on pets now&quot;. It also fixes the &quot;bomb crash, disappearing chickens, and more&quot;. This follows our story last week about how players were removing pet hats to combat performance issues in the game.

                              <span>In Rue Valley you role play a guy with poor mental health. He wanders around a crappy motel, stuck in the same old patterns of life, seemingly unable to escape his inner demons. When confronted with the premise for this upcoming RPG you may have one of two reactions. The first: you will say &quot;lol, it me&quot; with enough humour to wishlist it on Steam and earmark it for the future. The second: you will mutter &quot;ugh, it me&quot; and be immediately put off by the idea of having to tolerate an entire second layer of psychological hangups. 
There is a third secret reaction though... you might think: oh, this looks a lot like Disco Elysium, but in the real world.

                              <span>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: running away is the best feeling in videogames. More specifically, being chased is the best feeling in videogames, a sentiment I’d happen to share with my golden retriever if you replaced the word “videogames” with “the universe”. He is a purer being, but he’ll also never know the joy of executing a rail-dismount into a dashing corner-jump escape in Deadlock, and for this he deserves our pity.

It’s easy to miss if you haven’t played for at least a few hours, but Deadlock packs one of the most engaging movement systems this side of Tribes Ascend.

                              <span>The gaming keyboard market is currently tripping over itself, trying to equip everything with the technology most commonly known as Snap Tap: a feature that promises hyperfast inputs of two alternating keypresses, making you an unkillable side-strafing blur in your FPS of choice. Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.
However, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.
Neither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap &quot;should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.&quot; But do you?

                              <span>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter Unreal to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They&#x27;ve also given the same permission for Unreal Tournament to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time, Facing Worlds).

                              <span>Well, that was quick. After artwork leaked last week for what looked very much like a remaster of classic real-time strategy Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness, Blizzard sneakily dropped both that and a remaster of Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans last night. They’re bundled together with Warcraft III: Reforged - itself with a new patch - in a &#x27;Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest&#x27;, which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available on Battle.net, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.

Fowler revealed the news while speaking with Entertainment Weekly. While discussing what&#x27;s next for the film franchise, Fowler said the third movie will have a post-credit scene featuring a new character. While he doesn&#x27;t outright confirm a Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Sonic 3 will offer some kind of hint as to where the series can go. 


&quot;It&#x27;s fun to see the fan debates online about who&#x27;s coming up next, who&#x27;s going to be teased at the end of the film,&quot; Fowler told Entertainment Weekly. &quot;We have a lot of the same conversations. We&#x27;ve all got our favorites on the film…</span>

Phil Spencer, the current CEO of Microsoft Gaming, is well aware of Xbox&#x27;s absence from the handheld gaming market, and he just revealed something quite fascinating about it. In an interview with Bloomberg, Spencer not only confirmed that Microsoft has plans of making a handheld device, but that the company is already working on prototypes and considering what exactly to make. However, he also confirmed that this device is still a few years away from becoming a reality…</span>

                              <span>It’s been a while since we last visited the Pandæmonium raid storyline in Final Fantasy XIV, but with the release of patch 7.1, the epilogue for the story is finally available to play. What’s more, it comes with some worthwhile rewards, so it’s definitely worth seeking out. 


If you think back to the Pandæmonium raids, specifically the 11th Circle, you’ll remember Themis, which is the true name of Elidibus. Don’t worry if you’re confused even now by the Convocation of the Fourteen, it’s enough to confuse even the biggest lorehound. You’ll also likely remember that when we last visited the Pandæmonium storyline, Themis acknowledged us as a friend before returning to the Aetherial Sea. 


Now it’s time to wrap up the story completely, and you’ll get your own mini Themis for doing so. To get…</span>

                              <span>Did you know you can purchase the entire Metro trilogy of games for less than $7 on Steam? Well, today is the last day you can do it. There are less than 24 hours to save about 90% on three of the best niche post-apocalyptic games to grace the last 14 years.


The entire Metro saga is on sale to celebrate the release of Metro Awakening, which launched for VR devices on November 7. But if you&#x27;re not really a VR player and still fancy a tour through an apocalyptic wasteland, now&#x27;s a good time to consider grabbing the games that came before it — if you don&#x27;t already own them. Personally, playing VR games makes me feel a bit queasy after a while. I&#x27;m fine fighting mutant bats as my air supply slowly dwindles, but I&#x27;m happier doing it without the added nausea.

                              <span>Words have weight, which is why I swing them around with reckless abandon. I’m not sure that’s what Great God Grove is about unless you only take it literally. It’s more about identity, authority, communication, and misunderstanding.


It’s the follow-up to Smile For Me by Limbolane. But while the two games have similarities, you might miss the relation just by looking at it. One game has you interred in an asylum, while the other has you fixing the relationships of the gods. However, what they have in common is head nods and fixing people.

A mid-season Campfire Chat on November 12 discussed the significant changes to the existing builds and classes. While there are some significant shifts and tweaks, the Welcome Back Boost can be a great incentive for those who may have taken a break from the game. Alternatively, it can be the perfect jump start for beginners who might be playing Season 6 for the first time. Either way, you won&#x27;t want to miss out on this bonus to help yourself clear the content in the ongoing sixth season of Diablo 4.

                              <span>With the release of patch 7.1 in Final Fantasy XIV, many new items were added that can be purchased or obtained from various sources. One of these items was foretold in the preliminary patch notes and can turn even the clumsiest of players into a cocktail genius. 


The Shake Drink emote is a perpetual emote, meaning that it doesn’t end until you move or do something to interrupt it. It’s not just visual, either, as long as the emote is being performed, a shaking sound will accompany the movement. 


This is a particularly exciting emote for those who dip into the FFXIV Roleplay community, particularly those who partake in the nightlife scene. It adds a new level of realism to the bars and clubs frequented by players and it is a welcome surprise for this patch.

                              <span>While most of the Warcraft Direct was...well...direct, Blizzard did end the show with a bit of a teaser: Player Housing is finally coming to World of Warcraft. The brief 44-second teaser showed a character walking into his home, with the walls adorned with the head of Onyxia, a Mechanical Shredder statue, and other various items from the popular MMORPG before taking a drink from a mug with the words &quot;Home sweet Home&quot; on it. The teaser ends by showing the World of Warcraft: Midnight logo, hinting that the feature will be part of the upcoming Midnight expansion.




It&#x27;s a feature that players have wanted since the start of the MMORPG&#x27;s life back in 2004. Without many details, it&#x27;s hard to know what exactly we&#x27;re going to be getting with this, but as long as it&#x27;s heavily customizable, we can show off some of our best achievements with it, and we can invite our friends, I think that would be a good start. Just no Garrison 2.0, please.

In a situation that echoes the reveal and subsequent Switch launch of Ori and the Blind Forest from Microsoft, we admit to feeling a tad shocked at the revelation that Sony’s LEGO Horizon Adventures would not just be released on PS5 and Windows, but also Nintendo’s humble hybrid. Sure, this isn’t the full-fat Horizon experience – PlayStation and PC owners keep that to themselves for the time being – but it’s comfortably the closest we’ve come to Sony migrating its first-party lineup over to another major console platform.
The result is a mixed bag. Lego Horizon Adventures starts as an incredibly fun, visually arresting dive into Guerrilla Games&#x27; flagship franchise; one that benefits from a more playful tone compared to the series proper, with faithful elements that will please fans of Aloy and Lego alike. But it’s also quite a shallow, repetitive game that leans heavily on a rather basic structure, with dull level design and severely limited stealth elements putting a dampener on the experience.

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is celebrating its 20th anniversary this week after an initial Gamecube launch on 15th November 2004. In a new interview with developers Jack Mathews and Zoid Kirsch from Kiwi Talkz, it&#x27;s been revealed that the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode nearly featured playable Space Pirates.
The Space Pirates are an iconic, recurring enemy type within the Metroid franchise, and their similar stature to Samus would no doubt lend itself well to the first-person gameplay in the Prime trilogy, but alas, it wasn&#x27;t to be. Like many things in the tricky world of game development, playable Space Pirates simply fell by the wayside and weren&#x27;t implemented into the final game.

Those after some classic Lucasarts vibes, this one&#x27;s for you. Loco Motive sees you board the Reuss Express, a swanky train service full of swanky customers where nothing could possibly go wrong. Except, it does! Lady Unterwald of the Wald-Bahn Rail Company has been murdered and it&#x27;s up to you (a lawyer, an undercover agent and a novelist-turned-amateur-detective) to find the killer.

It feels like it has been a long old time since we heard about Misc. A Tiny Tale. We&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on this delightful-looking 3D platformer since it was initially slated for a 2022 Switch release, and now, thanks to an adorable new trailer (via IGN), it looks like 2025 will finally be the year we get our hands on it.
For those who missed the initial announcement (or if you haven&#x27;t checked out the above trailer yet), Misc. is a classic 3D platformer that will see you playing as an adorable tiny robot, embarking on a collectathon journey through a giant garden world. It looks like developer Tinyware Games has been inspired by the genre&#x27;s biggest hitters like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, but there&#x27;s more than a little Chibi-Robo thrown in there too — just look at that cute little fella!

                              <span>The wait is finally over.
A few years ago, Square Enix announced it would be doing a remake of Dragon Quest III in its popular HD-2D engine, but this was then followed by a lengthy period of radio silence where its development status seemed uncertain. While they were at it, the developers decided to go ahead and remake the first and second Dragon Quests, too. Now that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is finally here, we’re happy to report that the wait has been well worth it. Though it isn’t without drawbacks, this is easily the most feature-rich and enjoyable version of Dragon Quest III available.
Released in Japan in 1988, Dragon Quest III hails from a much simpler era, so the narrative is considerably less detailed than one you may find in a title from subsequent decades. You begin as a nameless warrior, the child of a once-legendary hero, now called upon to take up your father’s mantle and save the world from the threat of an evil dark lord. There’s not much character development to speak of, nor narrative depth—your character is essentially a blank slate and your party members are basically animated cardboard cutouts with some stats and gear attached. Though there are ultimately some clever tie-ins to other releases in the series and some new cutscenes to flesh out your father’s role, the plot amounts to little more than &#x27;there’s a bad dude out there; go get him!&#x27;

Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund has reduced its stake in Nintendo for the second time in as many months.
As reported by Bloomberg (thanks, The Edge), a new filing in Japan shows that the PIF&#x27;s stake in the Japanese video game firm now stands at 6.3%, down from 7.54%. This follows an earlier 1.04% reduction in October, a move which came soon after reports to the contrary suggesting the sovereign wealth fund was seeking to increase rather than decrease its Nintendo stakehold.

Internet provider Odido objected to the request, arguing that the Dutch anti-piracy group could have done more to target the problem closer to the source. The Rotterdam District Court found that the anti-piracy group can&#x27;t be expected to do more than it&#x27;s already done.

In one sense, they&#x27;ve turned from a game preservation champion into a slightly dustier, DRM-less Steam. Now, though, GOG have declared a renewed focus on not just selling aged games, but on tweaking more of them to work on non-aged hardware.

Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you&#x27;ve made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I&#x27;ve found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.
This is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.

                              <span>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the strategy of Sultan’s Game for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its Steam demo - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to Cultist Simulator, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!

                              <span>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were &quot;born in Chornobyl?&quot; as a play on &quot;were you born in a barn?&quot; whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been &quot;you been running S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl at full specs or something?&quot;, because based on the upcoming FPS’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.

                              <span>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as &quot;co-developers&quot; on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!
Original article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.

                              <span>One of the many changes to look forward to with the upcoming Linux 6.13 kernel cycle is the AMD P-State driver to be used by default with the new EPYC 9005 series processors. While AMD Ryzen CPUs for a while now have been defaulting to the modern AMD P-State driver that makes use of ACPI CPPC platform support for allowing better power efficiency, AMD EPYC CPUs have kept to using the generic ACPI CPUFreq frequency scaling driver. But now AMD engineers have deemed amd_pstate ready for use with EPYC 9005 &quot;Turin&quot; CPUs and will be the default choice moving forward. Here is more information and power/performance benchmarks for this shift while testing using the EPYC 9755 processors.</span>

                              <span>Google is facing criticism in Spain and Italy for alleged anti-piracy failures. The latest claim accuses Google of ignoring notices that aim to remove pirate IPTV providers from search results. So here&#x27;s the thing: why would a company take down 10 billion URLs from search but suddenly start acting differently? The public labeling of Google as &quot;grossly negligent&quot; deserves context too; two weeks ago, Google&#x27;s diligence prevented one of its accusers from deindexing its own website.

It did not, however, give me my beloved pistol. It’s fine. It’s in now, along with a few, less Neo-Volkite updates to other weapons.

                              <span>After nearly a year of public beta honing, the Nvidia App – Team Green’s new one-stop shop for desktop GPU management – is out in full. Not alongside the upcoming RTX 50 series, as rumoured, but right-now-today-this-minute. I’ve been testing out the launch version and while it’s not without some dud features, it does agreeably achieve its stated goal of combining the functions within Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience. And if installing it means never having to use the latter again, well, that’s 149MB well spent.

                              <span>My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.
If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter&#x27;s job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.

                              <span>The developers of hero shooter Overwatch 2 must have dropped a box full of old photographs while clearing the attic, spilling old snapshots of Route 66 onto the floor and getting snared in a nostalgic daze. The game is launching a &quot;Classic&quot; mode today that will let you play the first-person payload pusher as it (mostly) was back in 2016 when the first Overwatch launched. That means 6v6 fights, the original abilities of its heroes, and no limits to stop the entire team picking the same character.

Despite teaching you everything you need to know in the tutorial, it still manages to introduce new wrinkles and twists on the formula with each fresh chapter. My verdict? Imagine me lying my floor, massaging my temple with one hand and giving a fat thumbs up with the other.

But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel&#x27;s development back in 2004. Rolling Stone interviewed two key designers of the game and made a fun discovery.

                              <span>My brain is still thawing for the comment freeze, and thus there is sadly no cool industry person to talk to us about books this week. I&#x27;m currently reading Tony Tulathimutte’s Rejection. Jia Tolentino wrote about it for the New Yorker. Jia Tolentino also writes very good books. But enough about books, tell me about books!

Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and &quot;games journalist&quot; doesn&#x27;t really cover it. 

One of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games.

                              <span>Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!
Prepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.
Notably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.
Your mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.
This modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.
To participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.
Will you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!

Jesse Keighin, aka EveryGameGuru, faces claims of unauthorized public performance and reproduction, contributory infringement and inducement for sharing links to emulators and pirated ROMs, plus violations of the anti-circumvention and circumvention device trafficking components of the DMCA.

International viewers are left waiting until other services pick it up. In the meantime, some may be tempted to explore unofficial channels for pirated copies of the show. But finding a pirated copy is proving surprisingly difficult.

All of which is my cup of giblets. Here&#x27;s the launch trailer.

Still, it&#x27;s an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game&#x27;s first seasonal drop. It&#x27;s a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I&#x27;ll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there&#x27;s some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I&#x27;m mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.

                              <span>&quot;The cool thing about bombs is that you can hide them in anything,&quot; is probably my favourite Oppenheimer quote of all time, and in the case of Ian Hitman, it does raise an important question: with so many everyday objects equal to the rubber duck in its unthreatening aura, yet more inconspicuous, why choose to put an explosive in this one?
The simplest answer is that’s it’s a recurring bit of levity, a holdover easter egg, elevated to the status of key mission item in Hitman: Codename 47 before being given pride of place as an explosive in the World Of Assassination games. But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.

                              <span>Palworld developers Pocketpair have finally revealed which patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are suing them about. It looks like they&#x27;re focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.
If you&#x27;ve somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it&#x27;s a bestselling survival game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.

                              <span>In all honesty, Toads Of The Bayou could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its Steam demo ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit Into The Breach: turn based strategy with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect. Indulge yourself on the gourmet tray-tray below.

The developers say everyone is parting &quot;on good terms&quot; and that the last eight years of getting published under Sega has been &quot;amazing&quot;. But there are other businessy reasons, of course. Namely, Sega have been trying to trim down their European studios for the past year, and Amplitude is just the latest bunch of devs affected by that.

A post on the GFN subreddit announced the introduction of a 100-hour monthly cap (or &quot;allowance&quot;), effective from January 1st 2025 for anyone who signs up after that date. Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.

                              <span>Could tower defence be the ultimate &quot;it&#x27;s Friday and I am here in body only&quot; genre? I haven&#x27;t really thought about it before, but Rift Riff&#x27;s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.
Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it&#x27;s a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There&#x27;s a demo, if you fancy it.

                              <span>Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades&#x27; worth of great stuff we can still play today.
What isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.

                              <span>Nevím, co je &quot;legálně&quot; zapotřebí k tomu, aby se mohl film nazývat &quot;dokumentem&quot;, ale tohle působí jako zcela standardní nízkorozpočtový hraný film. Je to hořká komedie, která těží z atmosféry jednotlivých scén (velmi rozvláčných), aniž by měla jakýkoliv podstatný děj, směřující k nějakým pointám. (Ilča 40 %)</span>

                              <span>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it&#x27;s controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 

Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now via Steam, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I&#x27;ll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad.

Some mistake here surely?&quot; 1) My name&#x27;s not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a version for their own space sim.
&quot;Blast, if only I&#x27;d noticed this at the time and acquired one,&quot; you mourn. &quot;Ah, so many years I have wasted.&quot; Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man&#x27;s Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you&#x27;ll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021&#x27;s Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!

                              <span>Got an email about this. Looks cool. Is free. “I’ll write about that,” I thought. “I’ll write about that for Rock Paper Shotgun, a place that semi-regularly posts articles about cool and free games.” So here we are. If you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop, assuming the only reason I’d open an article in a superfluous and straightforward manner is because I’m about to deliver some sort of third sentence twist, you’re completely wrong! There’s no twist at all. I’m simply going to deliver some information about the game in a neutral tone. You can find VED: Purification, a free prologue demo to RPG VED, here.

                              <span>When multiplayer fishing game Webfishing came out last month, it offered a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say &quot;Trans&quot; or &quot;Bi&quot;. All this led one player to complain there was no &quot;Straight&quot; title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.

                              <span>A few months ago, the rumour took root that GTA 6&#x27;s release date would slip back from 2025 to 2026. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were &quot;worried&quot; about the new open world game&#x27;s progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar&#x27;s decision to mandate a full return to in-office work. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are &quot;highly confident in the timing&quot;, though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.

                              <span>When I was a competitive long-distance runner at school, breath control was paramount. We were never really taught this, mind. It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.
And then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.

                              <span>Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 action brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back Sifu. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.
“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.

                              <span>Putting aside my natural annoyance at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel too far away. Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.
Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there&#x27;ll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, Automaton West.

Co je to ale platné, když film zcela selhává v tom hlavním, tzn. v tom, aby nám nastínil, co se vlastně tehdy tomu děvčeti stalo a proč bychom se o to měli zajímat. Je nadhozeno několik navzájem si odporujících teorií (z nichž žádná není nijak překvapivá), nic se neprokáže, nic se neodhalí, a je konec. (Ilča 30 %)</span>

The American company says it&#x27;s committed to addressing piracy concerns but not at the expense of user privacy and security. Instead, the European Commission should ensure that its Piracy Watch List does not become a tool for advocating policy changes.

                              <span>Foxhole is one of my favourite games to read about, even if I don&#x27;t play it. It&#x27;s a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.

Planes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.

                              <span>&quot;Never read the comments,&quot; is a truth much-rehearsed by senior games journalists, but I have long since levelled-up past this axiom and entered into a new world of benevolent narcissism. I always read the comments, for all commenters are my children. They exist to glorify and preserve me in my dotage. True, occasionally my children say things like &quot;I think your writing and opinions are appalling, and that you deserve to be repeatedly run over by a herd of deer&quot;, but it is the nature of children to rebel.

The true highlight, though, is yet to come. And that&#x27;s through an entirely different Halo game: The Master Chief Collection. Soon enough, you&#x27;ll be able to play Halo 2&#x27;s lost E3 demo on it, thanks to some lovely modders.

                              <span>Back in the misty reaches of time (March) popular farming sim Stardew Valley got a big update that added more pets to the game (it also let you drink mayonaise but let&#x27;s not get sidetracked). Those new cats, dogs, and turtles had the cute distinction of being able to wear hats, should you choose to kit your wee friends out. Now, following many months of smaller updates to the game, it seems those hats are causing a problem. &quot;[If] you are experiencing performance issues in Stardew Valley 1.6, remove all hats from pets,&quot; said creator Eric Barone in a xeet. When asked the lore-accurate cause of this problem, he blamed: &quot;a strange rash&quot;.

It&#x27;s basically another method of capturing funny ragdoll glitches and posting them on the &quot;lol-games-are-dumb&quot; channel of your friend&#x27;s Discord. Or for posting that flukey knife throw in Call Of Duty to Twitter, as if you really meant to kill the man from across the map all along. Or saving a clip for your personal records, like the footage of that time you yeeted an innocent citizen off the 50-foot wall of a castle town in Dragon&#x27;s Dogma 2. We all do that, right? Right?

                              <span>We’re still a week away from Blizzard’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct next Wednesday the 13th of November, but art from an apparent remaster of 1995 real time strategy game Warcraft II: Tides Of Darkness has leaked online, via Xibbly user Stiven. It’s a thin one, as far as leaks go, but does show what looks to be cover, logo art, and a Battle.net icon. Thanks for the spot, Percy Coswald Gamer.

                              <span>Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are all on the way in the upcoming expansion for strategy game Total War: Warhammer 3, and Creative Assembly have just released their latest dev vlog with a few more details on what to expect. There’s still no word on the exact title, although given the established naming convention (Shadows Of Change, Thrones Of Decay), I’m tentatively calling it “Sniffers Of Glue” in honour of the No Think, Only Krump faction selection.
You’ll find the vlog in its full glory below. What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones. The source of the bones is not revealed.

Confirmation that piracy blocking tests are now being conducted at the internet&#x27;s core routers isn&#x27;t a surprise. It&#x27;s only the internet&#x27;s spinal column, so what could possibly go wrong?

                              <span>After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.
The work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:
Wait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)
Mask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)
The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)
Marvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat&#x27;s Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)
Other games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.
We continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.
To run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.

                              <span>A lawsuit filed in the U.S. claims that a pirate IPTV seller adopted a novel marketing strategy to support a business with 450,000 subscribers . According to the plaintiffs, the owner of the service &quot;held himself out as a Chicago-area law enforcement officer&quot; to &quot;mitigate potential concerns&quot; over the unlawfulness of his business. A theoretical damages claim of more than a billion dollars, plus an allegation of wiretapping, makes this case a little more spicy than most.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who&#x27;ve allegedly data-mined the beta&#x27;s monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.
If every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they&#x27;re further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.

                              <span>As a yearly blockbuster, Call of Duty, through sheer expense and effort, would like you to think it is the Die Hard of video games. Or, depending on the setting, the Saving Private Ryan of video games. But it is barely Black Hawk Down. This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: &quot;yup, it&#x27;s COD&quot;, like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day&#x27;s catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that. How does the single player story mode hold up? Some are calling it the best campaign in years. And I guess that&#x27;s true, in the sense that it is the least worst.

                              <span>Discourse? Look mate, I’m just here to test the Steam Deck. Dragon Age: The Veilguard runs like a tap on any halfway decent desktop hardware, so was naturally going to be worth trying on the weaker Deck. And sure enough, Bioware’s RPG (which is really more of an action game with the occasional verbal spar) settles comfortably into handheld life.
In fact, Valve have festooned its Steam page with a Verified medal, a seal of approval for any game that performs and controls well on the Steam Deck without any glaring weaknesses or impractical annoyances. It’s still worth playing around with the settings – more on those later – but I’ll back up that official assessment, having played for several hours without so much as an undersized tooltip.

                              <span>The trailer for Bambas! starts off innocently enough. It&#x27;s an &quot;innovative urban walking simulator&quot; in which you play a disembodied pair of shoes, individually moved with a controller&#x27;s analog sticks and trigger buttons. The first half of the trailer is all whimsy and playground fun - kicking a football, standing on a climbing frame, riding a skateboard. But then a note of darkness creeps in, as the player begins to channel the sheer nihilistic inconsequentiality of a world in which shoes have no thinking human bodies to restrain them.

                              <span>To say that Factorio: Space Age throws out the rulebook is an understatement. It&#x27;d be more fitting to say it&#x27;s somehow automated the whole process: an inserter plucked out the rulebook from my brain and deposited it in hot magma, while a new rulebook was churned out in a nearby machine and plopped into my brain from the other side - only for that to be immediately plucked out and incinerated as well. With each new planet and each new phase, Space Age reinvents itself. I&#x27;m battling hyperbole here, but ah hell, I admit defeat. Factorio: Space Age is a masterpiece, the final form of perhaps the most well-crafted building game I&#x27;ll ever play.

                              <span>I have zero archaeology experience or knowledge, but I bet archaeologists really love their jobs (for the most part). They get to analyse and discover cool artefacts and educate us on the histories of forgotten civilisations. That&#x27;s dreamy stuff, that is. But I do wonder what it&#x27;s like for archaeologists to discover and study something they shouldn&#x27;t have; something with a disturbing secret - a curse, maybe. Bite-sized horror game The Children Of Clay explores this idea and I&#x27;d like more of it, please.

                              <span>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.
Fortunately, real time strategy Empire Of The Ants understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.

                              <span>Early reactions to Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer range from frothing dislike through omnimovement hype to our own Ed Thorn&#x27;s dead-eyed appraisal that it&#x27;s &quot;a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don&#x27;t like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.&quot; I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 


Perhaps it would be a different story if he&#x27;d encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6&#x27;s developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that &quot;Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.&quot; The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you&#x27;ve had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.

With millions of monthly visits the site was destined to profit from the demise of several large competitors. The opposite happened. Facing legal pressure, Braflix has decided to throw in the towel instead.

                              <span>Critics of Italy&#x27;s Piracy Shield are not difficult to find but, with its powerful and influential proponents rarely far away, getting heard is a considerable challenge. Not to mention getting anything done. After calling for the platform&#x27;s suspension and meeting resistance in the wake of the recent Google Drive blocking blunder, AGCOM board member Elisa Giomi has gone public with a laundry list of concerns. It pulls zero punches.

For all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.

                              <span>Twitch have introduced a new &quot;Politics and Sensitive Social Issues&quot; label for streams that &quot;focus&quot; on topics like &quot;elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict&quot;. As with the streaming giant&#x27;s existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.
Advertisers, similarly, can &quot;make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to&quot; - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don&#x27;t want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch&#x27;s hope is that &quot;the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.&quot;

                              <span>It’s tempting to frame Straftat as a throwback to an older, better time for the multiplayer FPS, when the lingo was coded in frags and gibs and sucking it down, when satisfaction was drawn entirely from performance rather than some convoluted, artificial system of progression. Not only would this be inaccurate, but it would also do a disservice to what Straftat truly is, namely a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting.

                              <span>The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.
Still, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.

                              <span>When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter The Forever Winter launched into early access in September it was somewhat messy. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement&#x27;s inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you&#x27;re not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you&#x27;ve collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they&#x27;ve answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.
It&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.

I need to avoid any complicated write-ups, or my brain will detonate similarly and paint north London grey.
Ah, a minigolf game! I think I can just about hack the concept of minigolf, on this most desperate of Mondays. It is golf but mini. Bonzai golf. Digestible! Intuitive! Why, I&#x27;ve managed to write 100 words without even looking at the Steam page. Let&#x27;s do so now. Wait a minute, this isn&#x27;t minigolf. It&#x27;s Mini Mini Golf Golf. What is Mini Mini Golf Golf? &quot;Destabilize the present and plunge into a neon psychohistory of a bizarre entity in distress,&quot; the Steam page explains. &quot;This is not a game about minigolf.&quot; It is too late to flee.

                              <span>I was excited for Slitterhead, an action adventure game by Bokeh Studio, a studio founded by none other than your boy Keiichiro Toyama: the creator of Silent Hill, Gravity Rush, and the Siren series. And within that first hour, Slitterhead&#x27;s body-possessing and Hong Kong-inspired streets had me thinking, &quot;Is this it, the sleeper hit of 2024?!&quot;
No, sadly not. It&#x27;s no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting. Thing is, they are ultimately just attempts, attempts that fall victim to an emptiness and jitteriness that quickly reveals Slitterhead&#x27;s true, irritating form.

                              <span>I didn’t get much further in the extremely popular beta for the haute-couture-asaurus action of Monster Hunter Wilds than perfecting the exact orange-to-white ratio of my cat. Not because I wasn’t having fun, but because I immediately started looking up GPU prices after playing for ten minutes. As such, I didn’t spend enough time with the combat to get a proper feel for it. Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality. According to a clip shared on X by user Blue Stigma, there&#x27;s a good reason for those misgivings. It&#x27;s all about frames, you see.

                              <span>One of my lesser quality tests for an RPG is whether the shopkeepers complain at you for not buying anything. Grumpy shopkeepers, good RPG. This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler Thysiastery, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.

                              <span>Put your hand up if you&#x27;d forgotten that every Assassin&#x27;s Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That&#x27;s not the actual distant past you&#x27;re parkouring through. That isn&#x27;t actual Renaissance architecture you&#x27;re clambering on. It&#x27;s a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA&#x27;s fault, not Ubisoft&#x27;s. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that&#x27;s simply because you have bad genes.
We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin&#x27;s Creed&#x27;s modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3. In Assassin&#x27;s Creed Shadows, however, they&#x27;re planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.

                              <span>Amazon is cracking down on pirate streaming apps that offer unauthorized access to Prime Video content.  The company recently filed DMCA takedown notices with GitHub to remove APKs associated with popular apps such as PikaShow, Castle, and FlixFox.  Interestingly, the takedown requests were made on behalf of Amazon Seller Services, an Indian subsidiary not typically linked to Amazon&#x27;s streaming platform.

                              <span>It&#x27;s official: I am once again the Sunday correspondent around here. That means it falls to me to round up (mostly) good (mostly) writing about (mostly) video games. I will otherwise be spending my Sunday continuing the fight against my dog&#x27;s fleas, which rebound every three weeks no matter how much I spray, scrub or throw things away.

                              <span>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn&#x27;t a rail shooter, so you&#x27;ll be typing to explore and navigate, too.

It&#x27;s now got a release of February 2025, and there&#x27;s a demo you can play now.

I&#x27;m expecting some really juicy catch-up comments next weekend! In the meantime, this post will stay up as usual so you can at least hear what we&#x27;re getting up to in the treehouse.
Congratulations on making it to another checkpoint, fellow traveller. Please spend your hard-earned coin on one of the following bonuses: either a weekend of games but no sleep; a weekend of sleep but no games; or a weekend of health and activity but nothing to post in the comments below? Your choice! Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all clicking on this weekend.

                              <span>People have asked me, a Call Of Duty liker, &quot;How&#x27;s the new COD?&quot; - such is the mass appeal of Call Of Duty that even a lot of my non-industry pals are invested in whether Black Ops 6&#x27;s shooty really does bang. And every single time my brain clunks into gear and I turn inwards, where I struggle to come up with anything meaningful to say. So much so that a fog develops and out of the fog emerges a figure - it&#x27;s me. I&#x27;m holding an M4A1 with an extended barrel and a vertical foregrip. My brain and body perform a pincer movement of physical response: 1) I shrug 2) I say, &quot;It&#x27;s like Call Of Duty&quot;.

                              <span>There’s plenty that you could justifiably expect from a Bioware RPG: chats with mates, opportunities to get those mates horribly killed, surviving mates turning to the side then walking offscreen. But I don’t think anyone expected Dragon Age: The Veilguard to be, at least on a purely technical level, one of the smoothest-performing, settings-rich AAA PC releases of the year so far.

Speaking as somebody who would quite like there to be more Alan Wake games - or at least, moderately weird and pretty decent blockbuster singleplayer horror games - I am both pleased by this news and a little troubled that Remedy&#x27;s eldritch forest fable (which came out in October 2023) has yet to break even.

                              <span>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie action game Showa American Story is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:

                              <span>We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.
The Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.
Rise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor&#x27;s rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.
You’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.

                              <span>Unrest is a roleplaying game developed by Pyrodactyl Studios set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India. You’ll step into the shoes of ordinary people and navigate a world fraught with challenges as they strive for safety, freedom, and peace.
We are proud to announce that Unrest is now playable using ScummVM thanks to the work done by our GSoC student, Kartik Agarwala! Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build of ScummVM. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way. If you encounter any issues, please report them to our bugtracker.
If you don’t own Unrest, you can purchase this game from either GOG or Steam. The demo for the game is also supported and available from our web site.
Now go, use your manipulative skills to bring peace to this troubled world where chaos is not afar. For the most daring players using the iron-man mode, saving and loading the game is only available using ScummVM&#x27;s Global Main Menu.

Hodně podobné jako &quot;Tajemství a smysl života&quot;, ale o něco méně WTF a výrazně kratší. Každopádně velmi fádní a nudné, pokud od začátku nevěříte tomu, co je vám cpáno. (Ilča 20 %)</span>

                              <span>Film, ve kterém většinu času není vůbec jasné, jaká je zrovna motivace které postavy na plátně (např. jestli právě dělá vtip, nebo jestli se bojí o svůj život). To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z &quot;Návratu do budoucnosti&quot; a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)</span>
